However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments."", ""While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns."", 'Unum in Focus', ""Unum (UNM) is headquartered in Chattanooga, and is in the Finance sector.

In the past five-year period, Unum has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 6.40%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Unum's current payout ratio is 18%. This means it paid out 18% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend."", 'Looking at this fiscal year, UNM expects solid earnings growth.

I would now like to turn the call over to Jeff Shealy, Founder and CEO of Akoustis."", 'Jeffrey Shealy', ""Thank you, Ken, and welcome, everyone, to our FY24 fiscal third quarter conference call. Revenue in the March quarter increased 7% sequentially to $7.5 million, filter related revenue was up 13% quarter-over-quarter and was the third highest quarter in the history of the company. During the March quarter, we had two customers that each made up greater than 10% of our reported revenue. XBAW-related sales accounted for the top four customers and 6 out of the top 10 customers. Our top 10 customers made up 64% of revenue. Our top 25 customers made up 78% of revenue. In terms of regional sales, 3 out of our top 10 customers were Asia-based. From a regional standpoint, 48% of our sales come from Asia, followed by 39% of sales coming from North America and 13% of our sales coming from Europe. Finally, our top two customers were Asia-based customers and collectively made up 36% of sales. During the March quarter, we unexpectedly experienced a major Wi-Fi 6E program abruptly sunset with one of our carrier customers. We had previously secured a design win with this carrier customer for Wi-Fi 7 and have already received production orders for this platform beginning in the September quarter. Overall, we are tracking nine design wins in Wi-Fi 7 AP platforms, and we see a growing trend to ramp major Wi-Fi 7 programs for enterprise and carrier customers in the second half of 2024. We remain bullish in Wi-Fi 7 and are currently in the early stages of production ramp with multiple tri-band and quad-band programs. As a result, we are guiding the June quarter revenue to be flat to down 5% given the Wi-Fi 6E sunset an imminent transition to Wi-Fi 7, a company continues to focus on expense and cost savings to significantly reduce cash burn moving forward. For the March quarter, cash burn was down 31% sequentially. Ken will detail our ongoing activities and impact on reducing our cash burn during his upcoming comments. I would now like to take a moment to discuss updates involving the company's activity related to the chips and science Act of 2022. Regarding CHIPS Act funding, there are two detailed updates to share with investors. As of the end of the March quarter, we are members of six microelectronics any comments, hubs funded by the Department of Defense. Membership to these hubs is critical as it allows access to be part of the hub proposal team for new government research programs. We currently have two active research programs under one hub membership and we are waiting on the decision with the first proposal potentially worth several million dollars annually. Beginning in the second half of calendar 2024. Furthermore, we are currently pursuing several new memberships with additional ME hub centers, and we'll detail our efforts and progress moving forward. Second, the CHIPS Act of 2022 includes a provision for a 25% refundable investment tax credit or CHIPS ITC on investments in facilities that manufacture semiconductors that were placed in service after December 31, 2022. We currently estimate the amount of the refundable tax credit applicable to Akoustis to be between $2.8 million and $4 million over the next 9 to 12-months. Next, I would like to discuss several updates in our primary target markets beginning with slide 5. Our first milestone for the March quarter was to ramp XBAW filter production for two programs at a Wi-Fi 7 Tier-1 enterprise class OEM. We successfully commenced preproduction deliveries at two ODMs for our customer during the quarter. One of the two programs included our first single crystal filter for enterprise Wi-Fi as it solves a difficult co-existence requirement while providing higher power handling for our customer solution. Our second milestone was to ramp XBAW filter production for Wi-Fi 7 with a new Tier-1 enterprise class OEM. While we did not commence ramp, we have received initial purchase orders in support of the program and expect the program to ramp in the September quarter. Our third milestone was to secure a design win for our Wi-Fi 7 solution with a Tier-1 network enterprise class OEM. We completed this milestone and announced two design wins in our press release earlier this month on May 1. Looking ahead, in the June quarter, we expect to ramp XBAW filter production for Wi-Fi 7 with a Tier-1 enterprise class OEM. We also plan to secure multiple design wins with a Tier-1 carrier for Wi-Fi 6E and 7 and finally, we expect to release at least seven new XBAW filters into production targeting Wi-Fi 7 tri-band and quad-band architectures. Next, I would like to discuss our recent developments in the 5G mobile market. During the March quarter, we expected to deliver the second of three Wi-Fi filters to our Tier-2 5G mobile RF front end module maker customers. We have a foundry contract with this customer for a total of three filters. We now have shipped the first two filters. The third filter is still under customer design control and has not yet been released to the foundry. Finally, we continue our engagement with our fifth mobile partner, offering our export process and foundry for their module and discrete product needs. We have shipped this partner multiple export dye for engineering evaluation for a future Wi-Fi 7 multiplexer application for the mobile market. Our anticipated milestone for the June quarter includes securing a purchase agreement with a new Tier-1 Asia partner focused on mobile and other market segments. I will now discuss our progress in our network infrastructure business. During the March quarter we successfully achieved approved supplier status with two Tier-1 infrastructure customers. Second, we successfully completed in our redevelopment and delivered filters for the 5G in 104, 7 gigahertz band for massive MIMO architectures to a Tier-1 network infrastructure customer. During the quarter, we experienced softness in XBAW filter shipments to our 5G network infrastructure customers. However, we expect flat growth of shipments for the remainder of calendar 2024 due to slow deployments of 5G small cell infrastructure hardware. For the June quarter, we expect to secure development order for band in 104 filter targeting massive MIMO with a Tier-1 customer. Finally, before handing the call off to Ken, I would like to provide an update on our defense and other markets business. As previously mentioned, our biggest success in the defense and other market segment was the introduction of our new XP3F technology, which incorporates a new revolutionary and patented multi-layer nano material that incorporates our single crystal piezo electric material. This new nano-material was developed with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA to scale the XBAW technology to frequencies up to 20 gigahertz. During the March quarter, we continued work on our multi million Phase 2 contract option, which extends our current DARPA COFFEE program and the funding through December 2024. As a result, during the March quarter, one of our top five customers were in our defense and other business category. In addition, we delivered our new XBAW PDK to two defense customers for ongoing foundry engagements to facilitate their upcoming filter designs. Furthermore, we completed the design and sampled new 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi CPE, Automotive XBAW filters to two non automotive customers, in our contract business. Our proposal on a new multimillion dollar program with the Office of Naval Research or ONR to fund RF filter multiplexers incorporating our XBAW and P3F single crystal nano-materials technology has been accepted for award, and we are in the process of finalizing the contract with our customer, so that we can begin performing in summer 2024. For the June quarter, in the defense and other market segment, we are expecting to secure our new government contract focused on advanced XP3F filter architectures beyond 20 gigahertz. Further, we expect to secure a [C-V2X] design win with a Tier-1 automotive customer focusing on the European market. And we expect to release at least two new XBAW filters into production targeting [C-V2X] and timing applications. And now I would like to hand the call over to Ken to go through our financial highlights."", 'Kenneth Boller', 'Thank you, Jeff. For the third quarter ended March 31, 2024, the company reported revenue of $7.5 million, which represents a 7% increase over the prior quarter and at December 31, 2023. On a GAAP basis, operating loss was $22.6 million for the March quarter, driven by revenue of $7.5 million, offset by labor costs of $6.7 million, goodwill impairment charge of $8.1 million depreciation and amortization of $3.3 million and other operational costs totaling $12 million. As a result, GAAP net loss per share was $0.26. On a non-GAAP basis, operating loss was $12.5 million. Non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.14. CapEx spending for Q3 was $0.3 million and cash used in operating activities was $7.8 million, representing a 31% reduction over the December quarter. As a result of our expense reduction efforts, we are guiding the June quarter revenue to be flat to down 5% as a result of the sunset of the current Wi-Fi 6E program and a transition from Wi-Fi 6E to Wi-Fi 7. As mentioned earlier, we remain bullish in Wi-Fi 7 and are in the early stages of a production ramp. On the expense front, we continue to undertake aggressive expense reduction and cost-saving measures as well as pursuing the investment tax credits or ITCs, all of which we estimate will reduce our operating cash flow burn rate by an additional 30% sequentially in the June quarter. Given the top-line projections, the current timing of the chips, ITC refunds and the full impact of recent cost savings, we expect to be operating cash flow breakeven within the next nine-months. I would now like to hand the call back over to Jeff.', 'Jeffrey Shealy', 'Thank you, Ken. Before closing, I would like to hand the call off to Drew Wright, our Corporate General Counsel, to provide an update on current litigation matters.', 'Drew Wright', ""Thank you, Jeff. I'd like to start with an update on all our litigation matters. I will start with the patent litigation in Texas, in which Akoustis is the plaintiff and Qorvo is the defendant involving a patent that Akoustis exclusively licensed from Cornell. Cornell is in the process of joining the case as a co plaintiff since our last earnings call, one of Qorvo's wafer suppliers filed a motion to caution a Akoustis and filed an inter partes review also called in IPR, challenging the validity of the Cornell 360 patent. Qorvo followed up with its own IPR, challenging the Cornell 360 patent. We are still early in case procedures. More importantly, turning to litigation in Delaware in which Akoustis is the defendant and Qorvo is the plaintiffs. The lawsuit originally began over two years ago and included claims of patent infringement, false advertising, false patent marketing, employee poaching, misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair competition, RICO, and civil conspiracy. Qorvo's claims are false patent marking and RICO claims were dropped before trial, which is good news. Now, after 2.5 years, the lawsuit has moved to the trial phase which began last week and is expected to finish this week. The lawsuit entered the trial phase with claims of infringement of two patents, false advertising, misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair competition, and civil conspiracy. Last week, Qorvo presented its fact witnesses and several expert witnesses. Qorvo is expected to present its final expert witness and rested case this morning. This week, the company will have its opportunity to tell its side of the story, the trial's expected to go to the jury before the end of the week and the jury is expected to issue a verdict in the next several days. We are and will continue to vigorously defend against Qorvo claims. However, the outcome of any trial is unpredictable, in particular the theories used by each party's experts result in very disparate estimates of the damages alleged by Qorvo. We believe the theories used by our experts are better grounded in the facts and the law. However, if the jury adopts the theories of Qorvo's experts, it is possible the jury will issue an eight figure verdict. For that reason, this litigation may have a significant impact on the company, including its value operations and ability to raise money. With that update, I'd like to hand the call back to Jeff."", 'Jeffrey Shealy', 'Thank you, Drew. The market opportunity for our patented high-frequency XBAW and XP3F filters continue to be substantial. We continue to work aggressively to achieve each of our stated objectives, and we will continue to provide updates on our execution against these objectives as we progress, I want to emphasize to investors that management continues to focus on improving our income statements as we navigate our business transition from Wi-Fi 6E to Wi-Fi 7 and expansion into the automotive network, infrastructure and defense markets. We continue diligently pursuing product cost savings to lower cost of goods and improve our gross margin, we have undertaken necessary steps to reduce our operating cash burn in the coming quarters. We believe this is prudent in the current economic environment. Further I appreciate our employees for their hard work, passion and dedication in working together to position our company for growth in the quarters ahead. Finally, I also wish to thank our shareholders who continue to support the company. And with that, I would like to open the call for questions from the investment community. Operator, please go ahead with the first question.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Craig Ellis with B. Riley Securities.', 'Craig Ellis', ""Yeah, thanks for taking the question and thanks for all the color this morning, guys. I wanted to start just by digging a little bit deeper into the revenue dynamics in the first half of the year. So understand that there was a program transition from 6 to 7, but what I wanted to clarify is the magnitude of that transition on what we're seeing in the first half, I think I had expected around $19 million of calendar first half revenues. It looks like it's going to be closer to [15]. So beyond the transition to 7 that comes back in the second half. Were there any other variances versus what the company's expected? And then related to that, what is the risk that the transition to 7 that program really kicks off either in the fourth calendar quarter of this year or next year. So it's for you, but maybe a little bit later. I appreciate color on those items guys to get it started."", 'Jeffrey Shealy', ""Hey Craig, good morning, Jeff speaking here. Thanks for your questions. A little bit on the revenue dynamics on the Wi-Fi 6E as we indicated in the script was with one of our Wi-Fi 7 customers that had is transitioning over. As the Wi-Fi standard was adopted at the beginning of the year. What I said in standard was adopted at the beginning of the year. And some of this customer made the decision abruptly to transition to Wi-Fi 7 in terms of the dynamics associated with that for the first half of the year, the revenue associated with our Wi-Fi 6E program was that approximately $1 million per quarter and that was the shortfall for this quarter in terms of from the Wi-Fi market. In terms of the other market segments that we had previously been projecting a very strong recovery in infrastructure. So there were really no surprises there in terms of our defense and other businesses, in terms of what we have going on with normal, what we have ongoing on the defense side, other businesses came in really as expected. We were a little light in the quarter on the [TDS] side, foundry services business there were some dynamics there that we came up a little bit light for the quarter. We're tracking that very closely for the current quarter and we're back on track, we feel and are monitoring that weekly but I think really the headline was the one program and [60] and I do want to emphasize we're 1 of the 9 design wins that we have in Wi-Fi 7 with that same customer. So they're just they're transitioning over. In terms of your final point about, the dynamics and potential push out for Wi-Fi 7, and we've got, as we said in the prepared comments, we've got nine programs and Wi-Fi 7, and we're tracking those very carefully and their diverse across multiple customer bases where we began supporting Wi-Fi 7 in the March quarter. And we're seeing a ramp that is expected sometime in the September quarter, and we'll continue to monitor that and David, if there was any further color to my comments."", 'David Aichele', ""I think you will need additional color off Craig, Wi-Fi 6E we talked about a lot of the delays or programs out or getting cancelled last year a lot of had to do the chipsets we're not seeing those issues deal with Wi-Fi 7. As Jeff said, the Wi-Fi 7 was deal, allowing to go through certification beginning of this year and received a lot of activity there to the nine programs this one carrier class that did see a sunset it was impacted their [OEM] as well. And we are already seeing the ramp on the Wi-Fi 7 program at least orders. So we have pretty good visibility on orders all the way up to the end of the year. So that is good news in that we didn't lose the customer altogether was just a sunset of that one program and the ramp of this they want and the timing. So we're bullish obviously coming out of this Q4 quarter that we'll see a lot of activity and likewise in the second half of this year."", 'Craig Ellis', ""That's really helpful color. Appreciate that Jeff and Dave, I'll ask my second question to, Ken as we look at our gross margin and expense dynamics. So with flat to down revenues, I would expect that gross margins would be flattish in the quarter and then we get the rise towards double digits in the back half of the calendar year as volume improves and exemplary job on expense management. Any color on just the contour of OpEx lines through the rest of the calendar year. Thank you."", 'Kenneth Boller', ""Good morning, Craig. Yeah, so on, I'll comment on a few of those items. One is on the operating expense savings. We've taken a lot of active measures to reduce our spend there, I do anticipate it coming down to the $10 million to $11 million per quarter range 0n OpEx. On the expense line, we have identified over $20 million in annualized savings on our OpEx. Additionally, on the margin, one of the key items there to remember is that we have 17 items in production and we have spent last quarter that will roughly double in the next year. We have at least 7 to 10 new products coming into production in Q4 of this year. This fiscal year in the June quarter and the products, they all come with a robust cost structure and particularly with the back end inside of the costs for those products. So we will see improvements come with new products coming online, some of them replacing older products that are more expensive. And I do anticipate that some margin while continuing to increase that was in the single digits, I expect that to get into the double digits here in the next few quarters. And then we evolved, we stated that our operating cash flow breakeven will be in the $11 million to 15 million of revenue per quarter depending on mix and that would come with a roughly 25% margin on those sales as well."", 'Craig Ellis', 'Got it, thanks for that color Ken.', 'Operator', 'It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Jeff Shealy for closing.', 'Jeffrey Shealy', ""Thank you, everyone for your time today, and we look forward to speaking you during our next update call to discuss the current quarter's execution against our milestones as well as our future expectations. Thank you and have a good day."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.""]"

Here, Wartenburgh talks about building a company culture, managing heritage brands, and making space for AWWG’s fashion in an overcrowded clothing market.', 'WWD: What made you take the CEO role?', 'Marcella Wartenbergh: Since I was a little kid I always wanted to lead a company, to lead people on change. My father was an automotive CEO, and I wanted to be like him and direct something — like an orchestra conductor. In a company, everything is connected. We often think of the fashion industry as just designers. People forget there are finance, HR, merchandising and marketing teams — and a brand is built on all of them.', 'There was also the opportunity to build on the brands’ history, and heritage. The company needed a cultural change and the brands themselves were ready for transformation. They needed to be re-energized. Sometimes, even if brands have a strong heritage, they can start to get dusty and I was excited about the opportunity to refresh them.', 'WWD: How did you start reviving the company and the brands?', 'M.W.: The brands all have a history and we needed to respect the DNA and codes. It was not about making a revolution. They needed to evolve as the consumer evolves and there was also the ambition of making them profitable. I needed to mix the art of fashion with the science of making them profitable. The brands also needed to talk to each other. There was not one group culture or identity, even though they all have the same owner.

Façonnable has the essence of the South of France; even the navy blue color it uses is different from the Hackett one. It’s more reddish than the English blues.', 'We also created these inner circles that allowed people from the different brands to talk to each other about what is and isn’t working.

I think the schooling I had over 20 years with Tommy, PVH, Calvin Klein really gave me the tools to be able to succeed.', 'WWD: What did you learn working with designers such as Hilfiger, Lagerfeld and Simons? ', 'M.W.: Tommy was a great mentor on product, and brand. He had a very clear vision of what he wanted to do. Working with Karl was amazing and another great education for me because I was able to work on a a smaller scale than in the past and because he and the company were so strong in terms of marketing, and the relationship with the consumer. Raf was driving the general concept at Calvin Klein and I needed to make sure that there was a connection to the commercial side. At the time, I was like an ambassador between the U.S. and Europe, making sure the strategies were aligned and also fighting specifically for what Europe needed.', 'WWD: What are some of the challenges you’ve faced in building a global business at AWWG?', 'M.W.: The consumer is very different in Europe compared with America, Asia and Latin America, and that’s one of the important things you need to accept when you build a global brand. The U.S. has one country, one language, one currency. In Europe, you have many currencies and at least 10 languages. A certain slogan may work in France and Spain, but not in Germany. You need to be more flexible and adaptable.', 'WWD: Having worked with an industry behemoth like PVH, was it a shock to return to a small company?', 'M.W.: The standards are the same, the essence of the industry is the same, but I think working in a small company makes you more agile. You need to be more focused because you want the best return on investment. You really need to be strategically thinking all the time. I think one of the important things that I did was open a headquarters in Madrid. For Hackett, the design and development teams sit in London, for Façonnable, they are in Nice, where the brand was born and is based. Pepe Jeans was born in London, but it has not been based there for years and has more of a global image, so it’s based here at the headquarters in Madrid.', 'WWD: The brands have different origins and market positions. How do you develop a strategy that allows all three to evolve, and compete in an overcrowded market?', 'M.W.: Strategic distribution is the key to success. You have to be clear about how you are going to position every product category, every label sub-label. We also do a close read of our consumer data. Those insights are key for us to decide the strategy for each brand. I’m a strong believer that Façonnable and Hackett should play more in the premium area. Not luxury, but premium. Experience, events, personalization are key. People still want to have the experience of going into a brick-and-mortar store.', 'For the late Millennial, Gen X, or Baby Boomer consumer, there is still a culture for in-store shopping and a desire to invest in products. We want to give the best price value proposition. Not the cheapest price but the best price. And that applies to service in the stores, too.', 'With Hackett and Façonnable, it’s about fabric, quality, craftsmanship, service, and a partnership with the customer. We take our customer service very seriously. If we get a complaint from either of those two brands, we go all the way to understanding why something went wrong. In the stores, we offer bottles of water, and often do special events, offering hot chocolate or even wine. People expect that. In other cases, we’re solving their problems, and offering advice.', 'WWD: Where does Pepe fit in?', 'M.W.: Pepe Jeans is speaking to a different customer. I always say our denim goes beyond denim. It’s about fabric innovation and sustainability: 98 percent of jeans are sustainable. We are working with technologies aimed at reducing water consumption; we use ozone fading [a technique that requires less water than traditional methods] for the denim. Our brand campaigns are also about education, and we try to explain why acquiring a piece of Pepe makes you feel different. We started with the Brooklyn Beckham campaign [In 2021 Beckham shot and appeared in a campaign for Pepe to highlight the brand’s efforts in water conservation]. Sometimes you need to tell the customer, “Hey, we’re changing. We are evolving.”', 'WWD: How are you approaching sustainability overall at the company?', 'M.W.: We see it as an investment rather than a cost, and our strategy has been to focus on the big volume makers. Usually, when companies want to make a sustainable product, they will choose one with low quantities, because it costs less. But if you make a partnership with a fabric supplier and say, “Look, we’ll buy 50,000 pieces of this more sustainable product. Let’s compromise. We all have sustainability commitments. Let’s develop this together…”', 'Our sustainability strategy is focused on product, people, places and partners. And with those four words in mind, we want to make sure that we are reducing CO2 emissions. With our e-commerce, we are now shipping directly from stores to reduce transportation miles and emissions. We ask our customers to return orders directly to [physical] stores because e-commerce is one of the biggest sources of CO2 emissions. It’s the same with packaging. We need to start educating consumers that having so many paper labels in a product is not good, even if they’re made from recycled paper.', 'Sustainability is everyone’s responsibility and we need to do it because we believe it is the right thing. And do it for the long term. I want to look at how we fix our denim, merino wool and cotton [sourcing and manufacturing]. The question is how we make the big volume merchandise better rather than focusing on a sustainable collection of 300 jackets.', 'WWD: What can we expect to see from the AWWG brands in 2024?', 'M.W.: Evolution and expansion. You’ll continue to see a strong, strong evolution at Pepe from a product and consumer point of view. And expansion at Hackett and Façonnable. We’ll be protecting our premium products, our brands’ identity.', 'WWD: Who are your mentors?', 'M.W.: Everyone who surrounds me. You’d be surprised how many things I learn every day. You walk into a room, and people think, “She’s the CEO. She knows it all.” When I get home in the evening, I always ask myself the same questions: “What did I learn today?” “What did I give?” or “How did I transcend today as a human being, and as a leader?” The next generations are really my mentors, too. They are the ones who are keeping me sharp, on everything from AI to sustainability, finance and social media.', 'WWD: Tell me about your monthly coffee mornings with employees.', 'M.W.: I call it “a coffee with Marcella.” It’s around 25 to 35 people from across the organization, and it doesn’t matter which team or which role. I do it in Madrid, in the Barcelona office [where the logistics and finance team are located] and in London, too. I always say it’s like being in Starbucks or in a bar, and meeting with friends that you haven’t seen for a long time. And you can ask anything. We have great fun and great conversations. There’s coffee and cookies. They ask me about my career, the challenges I’ve faced, and about the business. It’s a way to get close to the people, and a way for the staff to get to know each other, too.', 'WWD: What do you do in your spare time?', 'M.W.: I work seven days a week, and I work all day. I love it. My husband will always say that Marcella without work is not Marcella. He knows it’s my adrenaline. I like to work, to brainstorm, to think. When I’m not working, I love cooking. That is where I bring all my creativity. I don’t like to follow recipes. I do my own. It can go from a simple meal to really elaborate things. I’m not scared to invite 20 people and cook for them. I also grow vegetables — tomatoes, courgettes, pumpkin, peppers and herbs. I love it, and when I garden I can put on my old pants, a sweatshirt, and my tennis shoes. It’s a moment when I don’t need to be a part of the fashion industry.', 'Best of WWD', 'Confidence Holds Up, But How Much Can Consumers Take?', 'San Francisco Authorities Seize Nearly $2 Million in Suspected Stolen Merchandise', 'Year in Review: The IPO Rush Transforming Fashion']"

Since this decade began, the three major stock indexes have oscillated between bear and bull markets on a couple of occasions.', 'When volatility and uncertainty arise, professional and retail investors have a habit of seeking the safety of outperforming stocks with well-defined competitive advantages. While the ""FAANG stocks"" are a good example of the type of leadership investors have sought during periods of stock market unrest, it\'s stocks enacting splits that have truly become a safety valve during periods of heightened volatility and uncertainty.', 'A ""stock split"" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter its share price and outstanding share count. The reason it\'s a cosmetic change is because a stock split has no impact on a company\'s market cap or operating performance. Stock splits are solely intended to make shares more nominally affordable for retail investors who may not have access to fractional-share purchases (what\'s known as a ""forward-stock split""), or to increase a company\'s share price to ensure minimum listing standards are met on major stock exchanges (what\'s known as a ""reverse-stock split"").', 'Though there have been companies throughout history that went on to be wildly successful after conducting a reverse split, most attention is afforded to the high-flying businesses enacting forward-stock splits.', 'Since the midpoint of 2021, close to a dozen high-profile companies have announced or completed a forward split. The newest members of this elite stock-split club are retailer Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG).', ""In late February, Walmart enacted a 3-for-1 forward split, which was designed to encourage Walmart's employees to buy shares of their company's now more nominally affordable stock. Walmart has consistently enjoyed a size advantage over its peers, which allows it to purchase its products in bulk and undercut most grocery chains and local shops on price. This helps to explain its long-term outperformance, and the need to split its stock."", ""Similarly, Chipotle's stock split is also about making its share price more nominally affordable for its employees (I.e., to encourage stock ownership and investment participation). Chipotle Mexican Grill intends to complete a 50-for-1 forward split in late June if it receives the green light from its shareholders."", ""Thanks to its fresh food/no freezer promise, as well as its limited menu, which shortens wait times in its restaurants, Chipotle's stock has soared by more than 14,600% since its initial public offering in January 2006."", ""It's unlikely that Walmart and Chipotle Mexican Grill are the only high-profile stock splits that are announced this year and into the early portion of 2025. I believe three prominent businesses are poised to follow in Walmart's and Chipotle's footsteps and become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks."", 'The first phenomenal company that has the tools and intangibles needed to join an already elite group of stock-split stocks is none other than warehouse club Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST).', 'Not including the spin-off of Price Enterprises in 1994, Costco has conducted three stock splits, the most recent of which occurred in January 2000. After 24 successful years without a forward split, a single share of Costco Wholesale will set investors back roughly $787.', 'Similar to Walmart, Costco has always used its size and deep pockets to its advantage. It purchases its goods in bulk, and therefore enjoys a lower per-unit cost on what it buys. The company is then able to pass along these cost savings to its members and undercut grocers and mom-and-pop shops on price. A consistently lower price for its groceries is a big-time lure for Costco.', ""Costco's membership model is the other primary reason it's been such a long-term outperformer. The company's $60 and $120 annual membership fees are high margin and can go straight to its bottom line. But more often than not, Costco uses these fees as insulation to ensure that it's undercutting grocery chains and local stores on price."", 'Something else a membership does is encourage consumers to remain loyal to Costco. Paying $60 or $120 annually will make members think twice about spending their money elsewhere.', ""I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that Costco stock is valued at a historically expensive 45 times forward-year earnings. The company's board might be encouraged to announce a stock split to ignite interest in its shares at such a lofty valuation."", 'A second stellar company that can follow Walmart\'s and Chipotle\'s path and become Wall Street\'s next stock-split stock is software and analytics provider FICO (NYSE: FICO) (previously known as ""Fair Isaac"").', 'The company behind the fabled FICO credit score has completed four stock splits since going public in July 1987. However, the last forward split (a 3-for-2 split) occurred 20 years ago, in March 2004. As of the closing bell on May 10, a single share of FICO was going for almost $1,329!', ""FICO is the perfect example of a business that's benefited immensely from economic uncertainty. The company's Scores segment provides credit score solutions to businesses to help them make more informed lending decisions. It also offers business-to-consumer solutions, such as its myFICO.com subscription. Through the first six months of its current fiscal year, FICO's business-to-business sales, which comprise more than half of its revenue, soared by 28%."", ""FICO's Software segment has been no slouch, either. This division, which provides analytics and decision-making solutions to cover customer engagement, fraud detection, marketing, and professional services, enjoyed an 8% sales boost through the first-half of fiscal 2024."", ""What makes FICO a strong candidate for a stock split is the fact that its previous stock splits occurred with the company's shares well below $100. Admittedly, fractional-share purchasing at many online brokers has made a company's share price somewhat of a moot point. But with FICO's stock at its highest nominal share price in history, it's only logical to expect a split sooner than later."", ""The third amazing business that can follow in the footsteps of Walmart and Chipotle Mexican Grill and become Wall Street's next stock-split stock is semiconductor titan Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO)."", 'Prior to its merger with Avago Technologies in 2016 (Avago kept the Broadcom name), Broadcom had completed three stock splits. However, its new owner since 2016 has never conducted a stock split. A single share of Broadcom will set investors back about $1,333!', ""Broadcom's outperformance since the curtain opened in 2023 has everything to do with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. In April of last year, the company unveiled its Jericho3-AI chip, which is tasked with seamlessly connecting up to 32,000 AI-accelerating graphics processing units in high-powered data centers. Broadcom has the tools industry-leading businesses will be relying on to train large language models and run generative AI solutions."", ""But there's more to Broadcom than just AI. It generates the bulk of its revenue from the sale of wireless chips and accessories found in next-generation smartphones. The rollout of 5G has led to a sustained device replacement cycle that's fueled demand for Broadcom's next-generation wireless solutions and accessories."", 'Additionally, Broadcom can enjoy rapid growth potential from its ancillary industrial and automotive segments. It offers connectivity and LED solutions for next-gen vehicles, semiconductor solutions for various medical systems, and optical sensors for industrial automation equipment, to name a few of its ventures.', ""With Broadcom's future looking bright, a forward-stock split may be needed to keep shares within reach for investors without access to fractional-share purchases."", 'Before you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.', 'Consider when\xa0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $550,688!*', 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

That’s where dividend stocks come in. These equities accounted for an average of 34% of the market’s total returns from 1940 to 2023 and made significant contributions during decades of high inflation. This shows that building wealth through dividends takes time and patience, so one shouldn’t expect a bountiful harvest overnight.', 'A clear example of the power of dividends can be observed through Warren Buffett’s investment in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Berkshire Hathaway acquired KO shares for $1.3 billion back in 1994 and received $75 million in cash dividends through this investment. In 2023, the dividend amount received by Berkshire had skyrocketed to a staggering $736 million, and it is set to receive $776 million in Coke dividends this year. This highlights the compounding effect of dividends and solid returns they can deliver to long-term investors like Buffett. In addition to compounding benefits, it is worth mentioning that the company has consistently increased its dividends for over six decades. That is why financial experts always advise investing in dividend-growth stocks for long-term gains.', 'Kirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist in the Chief Investment Office for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, spoke about the importance of dividend growth stocks in the firm’s annual report. Here is what she said:', '“Generally, it’s larger, more mature companies that return capital to their shareholders in the form of dividends. Companies that have consistently increased their dividends tend to be more stable, higher-quality businesses, which historically have weathered downturns and are more likely to have the ability to pay dividends consistently.”', 'That said, maintaining dividend growth over time demands financial stability and unwavering commitment. Dividend growth stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 due to their potential for capital appreciation and financial health. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, delivered a 10.68% return to shareholders since its inception in 2005 through 2023, as we reported in our article, 14 Dividend Growth Stocks with Highest Growth Rates, citing data from ProShares. During this period, the broader market underperformed the dividend aristocrats and returned 10.05%.

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. US markets continued its strong rally in the first quarter. Robust economic data and relatively strong corporate earnings boosted the rally along with the anticipation of a soft landing of the market. The fund (Institutional Shares) appreciated 6.00% in the quarter compared to 9.50% for the Russell Midcap Growth Index and 10.56% for the S&P 500 Index. Stock selection and headwinds from the Fund’s longtime style biases led the fund to underperform in the first quarter.

(NYSE:IT) stock closed at $440.09 per share. One-month return of Gartner, Inc. (NYSE:IT) was -3.94%, and its shares gained 37.01% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Gartner, Inc.

(NYSE:IT) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:', '""Shares of Gartner, Inc. (NYSE:IT), the leading provider of syndicated research to the IT sector, contributed to performance. Fourth quarter financial results were mixed, with declines in net income and EPS. However, solid increases in contract value and strong full-year performance, including a 9% increase in net income and an 11% rise in diluted EPS, helped boost the company’s share price. In addition, a 19% increase in free cash flow for the quarter and 6% for the full year underscored Gartner’s operational efficiency. Gartner’s core subscription research businesses compounded at attractive rates, and we believe growth is poised to accelerate. We think Gartner will emerge as a key decision support resource for every company evaluating the opportunities and risks of AI on its business, providing a tailwind to volume growth and pricing realization. We expect Gartner’s sustained revenue growth and focus on cost control to drive continued margin expansion and enhanced free-cash-flow generation. The company’s balance sheet is in excellent shape and can support aggressive repurchases and bolt-on acquisitions, in our view.""', 'A business customer signing documents and being advised by a bank representative.', 'Gartner, Inc.

The account behind gamestop reddit phenomenon just three years ago is making his first appearance on X since 2021 looking at that inflation side, right, where the fed kind of set up, you know, just a couple of weeks ago where they said we're really squarely in this wait and see, you know, the sort of moment, right?"", 'That does seem to me suggest that you have, you know, a little bit more asymmetric risk to the upside from a market perspective.', 'If we were to get a little bit better than expected inflation report, they would like to move towards easing.', ""Uh But the problem is when you've got core services running at 4.8%."", 'And you know, again, as you highlighted earlier that just uh the the traditional core rate, uh X food and energy is running, you know, at around, you know, 3.63 0.7%.', ""Um, it's very hard for them to start signaling that, you know, they're ready to eat."", 'We have got one hour to go until the market close.', ""So we're taking a look at the major averages sponsored by Tasty trade and then Jared is going to help us walk through some fireworks that are happening in today's session."", ""But first, let's look at the major averages here."", ""We've got the dow down about 6263 points today."", ""That's a drop of about 1/5 of 1%."", 'The S and P 500 almost exactly unchanged right now as we look at it and the NASDAQ moving up by about a quarter percent.', 'Why are we not seeing more action?', 'Well, investors are looking to inflation data that yet later in the week, post producer prices tomorrow and then followed by consumer prices the day after for more direction on a macro basis here.', ""That's also reflected in what we're seeing in yields today."", 'Also not seeing much change there hovering just under 4.5%.', ""Also, we're watching what's going on in the crude oil market there, a gain of a little more than 1%."", ""We're going to get some more details on that oil trade later in the show."", 'But in the meantime, we got to get to Jared because he is taking a look at what is going on with the meme stocks today.', 'It is not 2021 Jared.', 'You know, I woke up this morning.', ""I didn't expect this gift but we have been treated."", 'Guess what?', 'Roaring kitty is back with.', 'The volatility is back.', 'The volatility pauses are back as well.', 'So here are our meme stocks today and let me sort by performance because we got some eye watering numbers.', ""I know it's, excuse me, really small but a MC in the upper left that is up 83% Gamestop, up 76% Tupperware."", ""Remember that that's a 40% cost just a little bit less than that new egg."", 'And I could go through the names beyond meat, uh Virgin Galactic.', 'And the list goes on here.', ""I haven't seen a lot of these names pick up in a while, but I would say over the last couple of weeks, some of these, some of these have and showing strength."", 'And in fact, I was writing about this in the morning brief.', 'Um specifically I was looking at clusters.', ""Now this map, this chart goes all the way back to 2021 the beginning of the meme stock craze any time you see an orange dot That's when you have a cluster of meme stock volatility outbreaks."", 'And what we saw in 2021 this happened at various intervals, not really predictive as to the general market, but then when we got into 2022.', 'Any time you got a cluster, they were laggards, money was rushing into the Laggards.', 'It was a good time to sell the general market.', ""But this latest lag up since October, I've seen meme stocks kind of interspersed randomly or maybe somewhat evenly."", ""I don't see the predictive power there."", ""And what I said a couple of weeks ago is that stocks is probably just another example of risk on and that may be what we're seeing today."", 'So a couple of uh or actually more than two roaring kitty videos later here is where we are.', 'Let me just show you a stock of game stop.', 'This is intraday and what it does, what it did here, this is about 121 130% up at the highs and much like I saw in January of 2021 you would see this of settling down.', ""You'd find the market come to an equilibrium before launching off again."",

so."", 'Miles Keith Gill roaring kitty.', 'He posts on X proper name for the for the first time in a long time, right?', 'Gamestop rips.', 'What do you make of it?', ""Can I just say this is Miles like favorite subject and that's why I wanted Miles to go."", ""I don't know."", 'But that miles, miles and I lived through the first meme craze together and I saw how much joy it brought him to talk about this stuff.', 'I think there still bring him joy.', ""I think the reason that I remain so drawn to business media is that it's, it's much more fun than most other media things that you can cover."", ""It's just not that serious."", ""Like there's a lot of money at stake and people know they try to assign seriousness to something."", ""Well, II I mean, there is some seriousness when it's, you know, trillions of dollars and all this and it's people's retirement, etcetera, etcetera."", 'But the vast majority of that is spoken for in, you know, conservative time tested strategies with all like an incredible amount of regulatory um you know, apparatus around that.', ""But there are these things that exist within markets, the entire crypto market is basically this meme stocks are the equities version of it where I, I mean, it doesn't make like it actually makes complete sense."", ""I think people over intellectualize something that's pretty simple, which is that there's now huge amount of people aggregating their, you know, conversation on the internet, mostly on reddit."", 'In this specific case, it can be other places.', 'It could be the Yahoo Finance message boards, it could be youtube comments section, et cetera, et cetera.', 'And there is like a very clear momentum when a certain person in this case, Keith Gill, also known as Warren Kitty speaks about a certain stock.', 'In this case, gamestop.', 'There is an impulse to buy it because of what has happened in the past.', ""And because pretty much everyone who's involved with this knows it's a joke, but it's also up 80% today."", 'So you know, go for it.', 'There you go.', ""It's just money."", 'And just to be clear here, all of this was set off by a tweet that he tweeted.', ""He hasn't tweeted since June of 2021."", ""That is a picture presumably of him or of someone in a gaming chair leaning forward, leaning forward after sitting back for a couple of years, he's now leaning back forward."", 'And then that tweet by the way, was followed by like a bunch of mash up movie meme kind of tweets throughout the course of the day.', 'One of them had the theme of run.', 'So, you know, Run II I took it to be like run stop.', ""The stock is gonna keep running or it's been on a run and it will continue running."", ""Um Also, let's not forget like Keith jumped onto the scene with a series of extremely earnest and detailed uh fundamental breakdowns of gamestop's business in the summer of 2020 when literally no one was paying attention to it."", ""It was like, I mean, I don't even know split, adjusted what it was at this point."", 'It was a single digit dollar stock.', ""And he's like, it's definitely worth way more than that."", ""And who knows what he's done with his portfolio, right?"", ""Like the cynics in us could say he went out and bought a ton of short dated calls this morning and then he sold them all and he's made all his money and jokes on everybody else."", 'But he is, he was a true believer way before there was any meme.', 'He literally just liked the stock as he put into the official record when he testified before Congress.', 'So your point being miles maybe just see this as what it is to a lot of people which is, which is fun, which is entertainment, which is Dave Portnoy.', ""Now jumping in and he's posting about it."", ""Portnoy will be the first one to tell you, I'm not an investor."", ""I'm a gambler."", 'Yeah.', 'And, and, and I think also like as Jared was, was outlining for us, there has been this energy within the market of pockets of enthusiasm, pockets of risk on.', ""I think the more serious versions of it is, look at what we've seen with Chinese internet stocks over the last month."", 'They have ripped hire.', ""Look at what's happened with utilities over the last month they have ripped hire."", ""There's a lot of energy in markets right now."", ""You know, coming back to a more serious tone uh for people seeing mag seven goes up, that group has divided away, but there's this sense of if rates are going to go lower over the next, you know, year or whatever, uh, equities are probably gonna be a beneficiary of that."", ""What isn't played out and we've seen that money move around."", ""Um, and maybe you could make the argument that if the meme stocks have been dormant for some time, maybe that's not played out."", 'I mean, a MC ultimately was the more mem meme stock than gamestop.', 'right?', 'And that stocks up more today, which I think tracks like A MC is the real play thing.', 'Gamestop, like has a more real business, I would say than a MC does.', ""Yeah, I mean, you know, uh, well, speaking real business, I was looking at the numbers for, uh, Gamestop in terms of what's happened to its sales over the past few years."", 'I mean, last year its net sales were about $5.3 billion.', 'Its net income was $6.7 million.', ""But if you look at the chart of the trajectory for either its sales or its income over the last few years, you know, it's been down to the right."", 'It has not been a good trajectory.', ""But, you know, you have like how much of this is just, it's fun."", ""People are having fun, I think, I think I, and I think Gamestop is more fun because if you look at what the management at A MC has done over the last two years, it's actually not that fun."", ""Uh They've like explicitly built all the shareholders who piled into the thing."", 'They got this weird, you know, the, a share structure that got folded back at a MC.', 'Everybody loses a ton of money.', 'The CEO gets paid a ton of money.', ""He says, don't worry, I'm not actually having the money but like he does because he unloads all the stock."", ""That's not really that fun."", ""That's a very cynical and dark story, I think within markets, I think Gamestop, while Ryan Cohen has his issues and he doesn't talk to anybody."", ""It's management's prerogative not to host an earnest call that's open to analysts."", 'Um and a lot of analysts, you know, kind of stop covering these companies too, especially gamestop, right?', 'They gave up on it.', ""Um So I wouldn't say, you know, Gamestop all like, you know, roses and sunshine, but it doesn't quite, to me have um some of the, I don't know, like the, the slickness that has gone on at A MC."", 'Oh, interesting.', ""I mean, I'm not the only person saying this, this is a, this is a, this is a, this is a broad take."", 'I think if you look at the, the machinations that have happened at that company.', ""Well, Miles Sud, I'm glad to see the gleam in your eye when we discuss these issues."", 'Hey, thank Keith G. The only thing is this will be over tomorrow probably.', ""And then we'll just, we'll be, it'll be, you know, let's hold this preview CP I and then we'll react to CP I and then we'll discuss, you know, next week's in video earnings."", ""That's why the meme stock is trade is so fun because it is an actually fun thing in a, you know, day in, day out kind of grind through stocks that, you know, can, can feel a little grinding."", 'Yeah, it can, it can.', 'Well, this is a little rave sunshine.', 'Thanks so much.', 'Appreciate it.', 'All right.', ""Roaring K as we've been talking about bringing the meme trade back to Wall Street and beyond a single post on X sparking a massive rally in gamestop shares with volume hitting its highest level since 2021."", ""It's not just Gamestop as we've been discussing shares of a mc Tupperware."", ""Remember that's a meme stock, Blackberry."", ""They're all moving sharply higher."", 'Joining us now, Tasty Live founder and Ceo Tom S have to talk more about this.', 'Tom.', 'Uh Thanks for being here.', 'Um Are you having fun today too as much?', 'I mean, you heard us just talking about it.', 'What kind of activity and chatter are you seeing today?', ""It's, it's kind of, yeah, of course, I'm having fun, but it's, it's all the chatter we're hearing today."", ""I mean, there really isn't much else, so it's been a slow week, you know, I mean, last week was pretty slow."", ""So this week, um everybody came in all perked up and um yeah, it's kind of dominating the, the story time."", 'Do you see Tom, you know, is this kind of a broader sign of just risk appetite ramping right now to you?', 'And, and if so, do you see that kind of playing out in different data points?', 'Do you see that in the options market?', 'Well, well, for sure, I, I think that it was a, there was a real lack of new ideas, there was a real lack of kind of, you know, there was a lot of complacency in the markets.', 'Like I said, the last two weeks were kind of slow and this rally has been kind of a grind to the upside and balls been crashing.', 'So I think that, you know, it was, this move today was really welcomed by, especially by option traders, but also by kind of everybody just as, you know, just as another level of excitement.', ""I don't, I don't look at this at all like I did in 2021 when it was almost a transformational moment, dragging, you know, tens of millions of people back into the marketplace."", ""That's not what we're seeing today."", ""This is just, you know, this is all the players just um kind of transitioning or, or moving into something that's actually active."", ""This is kind of like the old days on the trading floor when there's a lot of noise in one in one pit, everybody would run to that pit."", ""That's what we're seeing today."", 'Well, Tom, there was another aspect of this whole phenomenon in 2021 which was like the narrative of the little guys trying to stick it to the big guy, right to trying to stick it to hedge funds.', 'And of course, we know Gabe Plotkin um got caught up in that and there was a big short squeeze.', ""What's fascinating to me is today is that there's still a short squeeze that 24% of the company's float was still shorted going into today."", ""According to S3 partners, we're looking at what $936 million in mark to market losses as of earlier today in a single day."", ""Like it's so, it's so interesting to me that there were still that many people shorting this stock kind of quietly in the background."", ""I don't know."", 'Well, first of all, the float is a lot, the, the floats a lot bigger than it was, you know, um, three years ago.', ""And so that is one of the, there's been a couple of splits, there's been, you know, a lot of stock that's been, that's been issued."", ""So it's a very different situation."", 'And you also have to remember that, that those numbers are really misleading because there are huge index fund positions right now.', 'And on the short side of the index funds, because interest rates have been popping up.', ""There's, there is a lot of short stock out there that is just tied into different index arbitrage positions."", 'And, you know, Gamestop is one of the bigger, you know, I uh Russell 2000 stocks.', ""And so you're really talking about a lot of that, that number is mixed in with just, you know, huge R positions and they don't really necessarily not going after gamestop, for example, they're just, they're just shorting the index because it's an R play A and Tom, who, who's in gamestop right now is that retail institution?"", 'Both?', ""Well, I, I would have to think that there's some institutional and some prop speculators, but I would and I also think today you're seeing."", 'So what happens when you have a move?', ""Like what you're seeing today is that a lot of the high frequency firms, um after they learn their lesson in, in 2021 they try to get ahead of it."", ""So a lot of the volume is high frequency firms and market making firms that know that there's going to be customers coming in on the buy side."", ""So they're just trying to get in front of it so that they have some inventory to lay out."", ""So I think that's part of it and that, that's part of the excitement, that's part of the huge volume."", ""But I would say that this is a lot more retail and a lot when we say retail now, you know, it's, it's kind of a mix but, but retail is very customer."", ""And I would say that today there's been a lot of customer interest, especially, like, just in our own office."", ""I'm seeing it."", ""You know, people are talking in a lot of, you know, people that just work here, they're buying, you know, they're buying some gamestop, they're buying some A MC, you know, they're just toying around with them."", ""It's, it's mostly just kind of, it feels like play money, but I feel like that's, we're seeing more of that than we've seen in a long time."", 'And, and what do you think is driving that Tom?', ""Oh, it's just, you know, like I said before, it's just, it's just, there's the markets for traders and, and, you know, I come from, this has been my world for a long time in the trading world."", 'Traders are just attracted to noise.', ""And what's happening today is that there's an incredible amount of noise after being almost, you could hear a pin drop for recently for the last couple of weeks today."", ""All of a sudden there's this, you know, credible amount of noise."", ""It's like a stadium that erupts and you want to know who hit, who hit the home run."", ""Well, that's kind of what you're seeing today and it's just a lot of noise and everybody's attracted to the noise."", 'So all of a sudden, you know, you gotta get involved.', ""I, I think it's, it's, it's good, it's good for, it's good for the industry."", ""It's good for business."", ""It's good for what we do."", ""It's good for what you do and it's, it's kind of good for everybody in a fun way."", ""I don't know how sustainable it is."", ""Well, that's what I was gonna ask you to on this thing."", ""Now, do you expect what we're seeing here in gamestop to continue, or?"", 'No, you expect it to fizzle out pretty fast.', 'Well, as a, as a hardcore contrarian, I do not think you are going to see this is not going to be a repeat of 2021 and that whole, you know, that crazy meme stock explosion where gamestop went from, you know, $15 to, to 500 back down to, you know, whatever 100 or something.', ""I don't think you're gonna see that."", 'I think this is going to be much, a much more muted version of what we saw and maybe, maybe two or three days.', ""But I don't think there's much more than that."", ""I do not think this is 2021 all over again, but I do think there is an incredible amount of speculative capital out there that is just kind of begging for a shot begging for, you know, um, just, just kind of, I don't, I don't want to call a lottery ticket, but I do think there is a lot of speculative capital out there that's just looking for a play and Tom finally just quickly do you think that regulators are gonna be looking at Keith Gill again, you know, with that tweet kind of setting off this huge huge explosion."", ""I really don't, I don't, I mean, I know it kind of, no, I just don't think so."", ""I think that, you know, fool me once I get it, but I don't think that's the same thing now."", ""I don't think this is at, at the current levels we're at right now."", ""Julie, I don't think there's any chance this is, there's any regulatory issues at all."", 'I think this is pretty clean, fun at this point.', ""Um I, I just don't see it beyond that."", ""I, I don't think it gets to anywhere close to where it was in 2021 when there was, you know, industry wide issues and Robin Hood had those problems, you know, clearing issues and things like that."", 'I do not see that happening at all this time around there.', ""There's a very different, there's very different margins, there's very different, you know, the, the float on the short stock side, it's all the stocks are hard to borrow."", ""It's not that easy."", 'All right, I like to hear that.', 'Pretty clean.', 'Fun.', 'Thanks so much, Tom.', 'Great to catch up with you on this.', 'Thanks guys.', ""We're just getting started here on market domination."", 'Coming

risk.', ""I don't think it's a midterm risk."", ""Uh But if Apple and Google don't get in there and plug the whole or potentially for Apple's case, a line with open air, it could spell trouble because if you look at the biggest applications that that just took, took the world by storm like Facebook, it was initially free Google search was free with no ads, right?"", ""So you weren't paying for it."", 'And this has the same type of risk.', 'If you get eyeballs and experiences coming in, you could op uh open A I could monetize that multiple ways through a service payment, through advertising, through essentially sending you to another chat bot for a company that does make money, a food services company on airlines.', ""That's how it could be monetized."", 'And that is a potential risk to both Google and Apple.', 'And speaking about Apple, there was also a report that Apple is indeed gonna be partnering with open A I for some version maybe of its chat bot or on the upcoming phone

be the cloud based services, I believe if there's going to be any deal."", 'It would be cloud based services, maybe a type of deal where Google pays Apple today 20 to $30 billion to get uh Google search as the default search on the iphone.', ""Maybe this is a deal like this or maybe a it's less of a payment but more of a quid pro quo Apple has to have um very good on device A I or, or literally uh it's gonna spell trouble for Apple because that's what it does."", ""It's all about on device."", ""It's not about the cloud Apple's biggest level of sophistication on the cloud is

year.', 'You can see the stock has moved higher, moved higher again after its most recent earnings.', ""So let's get to why you still like it here."", ""First of all, you say it's still trading at a relatively attractive multiple."", 'Yes.', ""In fact, we're actually carrying estimates 10% above consensus."", ""So it's 11 times consensus and we're at 10 times."", 'And the main reason that were above consensus is that were more optimistic about investment banking.', 'And really Goldman is the pure investment bank of all the investment banks.', ""And I think most people don't appreciate, I used to work at an investment bank."", ""Um and they don't appreciate the synergies between investment banking and capital markets."", 'So when you do deals, then that generates extra trading for the trading operation and you saw that in the first quarter, but really the whole firm just outperformed.', ""Yeah, and let's dig into that a little bit more because we are seeing, we're seeing fixed income uh underwriting."", ""We're seeing also that sort of capital markets are perking up a little bit in some areas."", ""There's a little more M and A coming out, there are a little more initial public offerings."", ""So you think that's going to be good for do?"", 'And even in 25 you just had an A I great A I segment.', ""We think that the A I IP O boom will start in 25 which it normally does because, and that's why the US capital markets are so efficient is that we um you know, high valuations of the public companies generate IP OS."", ""So we think it's a little bit of a longer term play."", ""That's why even though the stock is working now, we don't think it's overvalued and even will get better as we go through the summer have rate cuts, at least from the ECB and then have a rally in 25."", 'Right.', 'And I think our last one was that derivative A I play.', ""There's also the fact that they exited the consumer business and sound."", ""No, now they're even a more, well, they were a pure play then they got into the consumer business."", ""It didn't go so hot and then they got out of it."", ""So they're back to being right."", ""I think that's why the multiples lower like Morgan Stanley trades at 13 times."", 'They were more resilient during the downturn because they have more steady wealth management.', ""Goldman's more is about 80% banking, investment banking and Morgan Stanley is 40."", ""So we think it's time to kind of rotate from the safe, safer."", ""I mean, we wouldn't be out of Morgan Stanley, but we're short."", 'It certainly, but gonna trade pretty well together.', 'But to get more leverage to banking from Goldman Sachs got you a little more.', ""Um uh we always like to talk about what the risk is in this situation and in this case, it's, you know, if markets don't do as well, then they could be a victim of that because they don't have that insulation."", 'Right.', 'This is absolutely a bull market play.', 'I remember when I started on Wall Street at Morgan Stanley during a down cycle in 89 we were turning a 0.4 times buck.', 'I mean, it used to be, these investment banks just got smashed.', 'So they are high beta stocks, 1.2 beta very correlated in the market.', ""If we're wrong about, we're bullish on the market, we have 5750 target."", ""But if we're wrong about that, you don't wanna be in financials and certainly not in investment banks."", 'Got you.', 'And you have, you guys have a pretty decent position and it is our largest position in ICAP.', ""So we're pretty um bullish about it."", ""But it's a sector."", ""We know we're in Manhattan."", 'I worked in investment banking.', 'I understand that, that when things start going, this is just the beginning in our opinion of the, of the boom.', ""All right, let's get to an area you don't necessarily want to be and that's in more in the regional banks."", ""And here we're showing PNC financial is just one example of the regionals which largely have underperformed some of the other, some of the larger financials over the past year."", ""So there you're looking, they don't have the benefit of being as much in the capital."", 'They are 5% to pick on PNC.', ""They're just 5% capital markets."", 'Got you.', ""So that compares with Goldman, that's, that's all, all of it."", 'Right.', 'Exactly.', ""So, one reason there that they're not gonna benefit um net interest margins have been under pressure and talk to us about how that's working for the regionals relative to rates as well."", 'Right.', 'So PNC is forecasting themselves about a 5% decline in net interest margin.', 'And the problem is when rates go up really fast, uh the deposit beta as they call it the or the sensitivity to interest rates start hitting, which is just a complicated way of saying people realize they can get 5%.', ""So they're not gonna leave money in a checking account or a six month CD."", ""So they've seen those outflows which means they, it's just March, it's pressured and also they have slow loan growth too as well."", ""Uh They're probably being conservative about putting credit out right now."", ""So those two things are putting pressure might get better in 25 but you have something that's declining with regionals and something that is booming with the investment bank focused."", 'And also they tend to have less exposure to that interest margin as well.', ""And the other thing, we've all been trying to sort of read the tea leaves on the consumer, you know, in from the payment companies by now paying later from the regional banks themselves from retailers."", ""And it does feel like they're starting to see some deterioration on the on the lower end, at least."", ""Definitely, I mean, if you just think about it, it's sort of, there's a have, and have nots in the US consumer, anybody who owns a home did really well from the inflation and anybody who doesn't did really poorly because they had to pay really high rents that are flat now but not going down."", ""So if your wages didn't keep up, so it's definitely pressure on the lower income consumer unclear how that's gonna unfold."", ""But if you look at the more investment bank oriented, they have particularly Goldman's now getting out of it, they have less exposure to that."", 'These, these large banks, their credit exposure is hard to track.', ""They're not like reeds where you can model every building."", ""So we don't really know what's going on there, but it's a potential downside."", 'And could we see defaults, for example, that would affect rising slowly already?', ""We don't think they're gonna be terrible."", ""But if the Fed didn't cut rates, we might have a slowing economy recession."", 'So we just further risk, um, without the upside, investment bank.', ""And so conversely, we'd like to talk about what could go right for the regionals."", ""And it's what you kind of just referred to that the fed could cut and maybe cut a little more aggressively than expected, right?"", ""If they, if the yield curve de inverts and, and we're well into 25 so the longer term story, the banks are gonna do fine."", ""And by the way, if there's a bull market, they're gonna go up there, risky stock, cyclical stocks."", ""So it's, it's probably could be a situation where invest in 25 maybe investment banking is kind of already full at full force and then it's time to rotate into and, and benefit from the net interest margin slowly getting better in 25."", 'And as for the regionals, do you have any position there?', 'Are you sort of under way?', ""We're, we're intentionally completely out of regionals and then not just in the investment banks, but in the money center banks that tend to be better hedged, less dependent on net interest margin have more capital markets upside."", ""So they're just better positioned in our opinion, in this market."", 'Ok.', ""So let's summarize what you're telling folks, Jay here, you're saying you would recommend buying Goldman Sachs given that reasonable trading, multiple potential benefits from avenues like fixed income, underwriting other capital markets and A I related IP OS coming down the pike and you say avoid regional banks, there's limited upside from capital markets."", ""They're not as exposed."", ""There's possible pressures on profitability from rate cuts and potential for credit metrics to worse."", 'And thanks so much for being here.', 'Good to see you and thank you so much for watching.', 'Goodbye or goodbye.', ""We'll be bringing you new episodes three times a week at 3:30

saying that Exxonmobil has a right of first refusal for that block.', 'Exxonmobil has about a 45% stake in that block and says that it has a right of first refusal for that block.', 'So wait to be

important for the market."", 'All eyes definitely focused on on this number.', 'Uh We have three hot prints in a row as most investors are, are aware.', 'Uh And the fed is really running out of room here in order to deliver the cuts that I think most investors would love to see and that the FO MC wants to deliver themselves.', ""So one data point doesn't make a trend, so they're going to need a few more."", ""Uh uh after this one, even if this one does come in light, I will say the, the whisper that we are hearing around Wednesday's numbers that we should expect slightly weaker."", ""But even if we do get it, get something slightly weaker, you're still looking at a three handle on probably both headline and core, still leaving the fed in a, in a pretty tight spot if they would like to see rate cuts coming in calendar year 2024."", 'So Jim, how you then sort of position yourself going into that?', 'Do we just assume that rates are gonna stay where they are for a little bit here and, and sort of strategize, excuse me.', 'Uh accordingly.', ""We're, we're actually taking a little bit of a more pessimistic stance as it, as it comes to rates."", 'Uh We are a little bearish.', 'We do expect a 10 year in particular to try to maybe retest that 5% level that we saw about a year or so ago.', 'Uh and even at the very least get that 20 or so basis points back uh post the last FO MC press conference where really what Chairman Pell went ahead and did is took any talk of a rate hike completely off the table.', ""So uh we know with the trend that we've seen recently, a bit of a reeler in inflation, the market began pricing in, you know, the probability however small of a potential rate hike coming in here."", 'Uh uh Pal went ahead and squashed that and we have a 10 year kind of rallying below 450.', ""So, you know, from a positioning perspective, we're, you know, we're taking, you know, relatively modest moves at the margin, but our view is for rates actually higher between now and the end of the year."", 'You know, Jim, we talked about that CP I print this week but another date on the calendar for investors is uh NVIDIA, their earnings are coming up as well.', 'Could that be a catalyst for the market, Jim?', ""Uh I think it absolutely, uh could be looked at it's, if you take a look back, uh the last 12 months, maybe even 18 months, NVIDIA is in, in one way, kind of all that's really mattered."", ""I mean, as much as we talk about the magnificent seven and whether that's turned into the, I don't know, the fab four now or the terrific three, whatever they,

to date that this one name has been, uh, has delivered and delivered."", 'Uh not just year to date but also in 2023.', 'Uh a lot of uh a lot of importance riding on this one number.', ""Um Jim can talk to us about utilities a little bit because that's an area that has been rallying."", 'I believe you like it as well.', ""Um Why, you know, and this is not typically a group that does well when rates are high Um, do you think it's gonna be able to continue to run here?"", ""Yeah, we're a little skeptical on that."", ""So, we're, we're kind of neutral utilities."", ""Um, it, I think you're, it's, it's a great point, Julie because, you know, this, this hook in the utility performance, if you track the chart on Yahoo Finance, you know, you, you can see that, uh, it's been pretty, pretty recent rally there."", 'Uh, and I think a lot of that has to do with this kind of doves stance that the FO MC came out with.', ""So everybody knows we started the year with these huge expectations, six rate cuts kind of kind of priced in or, or, or investors trying to bake in the cake for 2024 that's been walked all the way back."", 'Uh Now we put a few more back on.', 'Uh Thanks to the Ds from the last press conference and I think you utility is always a bit of an income play.', ""Uh whenever there's expectations for lower rates, you would expect utilities to kind of hang in there."", ""And that's what we've seen recently, especially with that uh kind of strong uh performance post uh press conference."", ""So, Jim, you said you're a bit skeptical of utilities."", 'What, where do you see opportunity right now, Jim, what, what sectors look attractive?', 'Yeah, it all kind of goes back to the same point which is uh kind of our view for rates.', 'We, we you know, we think rates have higher, we think inflation is going to be stickier for longer.', ""Uh And if we have that view, that's gonna probably not too surprisingly lead us in to the direction of more kind of value type names and what represents kind of good value right now."", 'Uh It is financials uh good conversation in the last segment uh on financials, very, very diverse uh part of the market for sure.', 'Investment banks, money center banks look pretty attractive right now.', 'Forward earnings and twelves and thirteens and fourteens relative to the broader market at uh 22.', ""Uh We're also looking at things

Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to be a hot theme, though some stocks have cooled as volatility sets in. A famous Wall Street saying is ""Sell in May and go away.""', ""But I'm not having that. In fact, some attractive AI stocks are ripe for the picking -- you just need to know where to look."", 'Here are three top AI stocks investors should consider scooping up this month.', 'They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Here is a beautiful chart to talk about enterprise software company Salesforce (NYSE: CRM):', 'The software provider has significantly improved its operating margins and free-cash-flow generation over the past couple of years, giving the stock a head of steam heading into first-quarter earnings in the coming weeks.', 'Most know Salesforce for its flagship customer relationship management (CRM) services, but the company has also built an ecosystem through innovation and acquisitions, becoming a one-stop shop that companies can use to track customers and sales, operations, and marketing, and stoke employee collaboration.', 'The company unveiled Einstein AI, a generative AI assistant to help users get the most out of its product ecosystem.', ""Salesforce trades at a lofty but well-deserved forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28. That's a steep price tag but one that's justified by the company's improving cash flow and margins."", 'Analysts have the company growing earnings by an annual average of more than 17% over the next several years, which makes 28 times forward earnings a fair price for this proven winner.', 'Management has begun repurchasing its stock to lower the share count and help boost earnings growth. I expect this to continue as cash flow grows, giving the stock a high floor that investors can depend on at a reasonable price today.', 'Most hear ""AI is replacing humans"" and think of robots from the movies. The reality could be more software-based. That\'s UiPath\'s (NYSE: PATH) specialty as an expert in robotic process automation (RPA), which involves software learning and performing repetitive computer tasks instead of humans.', ""The financial benefits of RPA are obvious for corporations: Software bots don't need breaks or benefits, and they are less prone to mistakes."", ""Nearly 11,000 customers are using UiPath today. They often started out with a small trial run, which then blossomed into full-scale implementation as the software proved useful. That's the secret behind the company's robust 119% dollar-based net revenue retention rate."", 'You can see that the business has grown large enough that cash flow is surging, and bottom-line profits are starting to follow suit. Analysts are pegging UiPath for annual earnings growth averaging 22% over the next three to five years. Shares trade at a forward P/E ratio of 34 today, making UiPath a potential bargain for long-term investors.', 'Over the past year, this stock has become a sensation, flying higher as people picked Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) to provide their turnkey server systems for AI applications. The ride has been volatile at times. While shares change hands at $800 today, the stock has traded as high as $1,200 and as low as $130 over the past year. So, what should we make of this vast range? Pay attention to the fundamentals.', 'Fortunately for bullish investors, Super Micro Computer is growing like a weed. Revenue increases have accelerated to triple-digit rates in the AI age. Management attributes this to AI tailwinds and the fact that customers are overwhelmingly choosing Super Micro Computer over competitors, leading to above-industry growth.', 'The numbers say shares are a table-pounding buy right now. Analysts are looking for earnings growth averaging 52% annually for the next several years, while the stock\'s forward P/E is ""just"" 35 today. If those growth numbers prove accurate, the stock will be a mind-numbing bargain in hindsight.', ""Remember that volatility is rampant with this stock, which fell nearly 20% recently because the company chose not to pre-announce earnings. Investors who are bullish on Super Micro Computer might want to approach cautiously and buy the stock slowly so they don't get caught up in the noise. Otherwise, this stock looks ripe for value-focused growth investors."", 'Before you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Salesforce wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.', 'Consider when\xa0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $550,688!*', 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

forward."", 'And then that tweet by the way, was followed by like a bunch of mash up movie meme kind of tweets throughout the course of the day.', 'One of them had the theme of run.', 'So, you know,

being miles maybe just see this as what it is to a lot of people which is, which is fun, which is entertainment, which is Dave Portnoy.', ""Now jumping in and he's posting about it."", ""Portnoy will be the first one to tell you, I'm not an investor."", ""I'm a gambler."", 'Yeah.', 'And, and, and I think also like as Jared was, was outlining for us, there has been this energy within the market of pockets of enthusiasm, pockets of risk on.', ""I think the more serious versions of it is, look at what we've seen with Chinese internet stocks over the last month."", 'They have ripped hire.', ""Look at what's happened with utilities over the last month they have ripped hire."", ""There's a lot of energy in markets right now."", ""You know, coming back to a more serious tone uh for people seeing mag seven goes up, that group has divided away, but there's this sense of if rates are going to go lower over the next, you know, year or whatever, uh, equities are probably gonna be a beneficiary of that."", ""What isn't played out and we've seen that money move around."", ""Um, and maybe you could make the argument that if the meme stocks have been dormant for some time, maybe that's not played out."", 'I mean, a MC ultimately was the more mem meme stock than gamestop.', 'right?', 'And that stocks up more today, which I think tracks like A MC is the real play thing.', 'Gamestop, like has a more real business, I would say than a MC does.', ""Yeah, I mean, you know, uh, well, speaking real business, I was looking at the numbers for, uh, Gamestop in terms of what's happened to its sales over the past few years."", 'I mean, last year its net sales were about $5.3 billion.', 'Its net income was $6.7 million.', ""But if you look at the chart of the trajectory for either its sales or its income over the last few years, you know, it's been down to the right."", 'It has not been a good trajectory.', ""But, you know, you have like how much of this is just, it's fun."", ""People are having fun, I think, I think I, and I think Gamestop is more fun because if you look at what the management at A MC has done over the last two years, it's actually not that fun."", ""Uh They've like explicitly built all the shareholders who piled into the thing."", 'They got this weird, you know, the, a share structure that got folded back at a MC.', 'Everybody loses a ton of money.', 'The CEO gets paid a ton of money.', ""He says, don't worry, I'm not actually having the money but like he does because he unloads all the stock."", ""That's not really that fun."", ""That's a very cynical and dark story, I think within markets, I think Gamestop, while Ryan Cohen has his issues and he doesn't talk to anybody."", ""It's management's prerogative not to host an earnest call that's open to analysts."", 'Um and a lot of analysts, you know, kind of stop covering these companies too, especially gamestop, right?', 'They gave up on it.', ""Um So I wouldn't say, you know, Gamestop all like, you know, roses and sunshine, but it doesn't quite, to me have um some of the, I don't know, like the, the slickness that has gone on at A MC."", 'Oh, interesting.', ""I mean, I'm not the only person saying this, this is a, this is a, this is a, this is a broad take."", 'I think if you look at the, the machinations that have happened at that company.', ""Well, Miles Sud, I'm glad to see the gleam in your eye when we discuss these issues."", 'Hey, thank Keith G. The only thing is this will be over tomorrow probably.', ""And then we'll just, we'll be, it'll be, you know, let's hold this preview CP I and then we'll react to CP I and then we'll discuss, you know, next week's in video earnings."", ""That's why the meme stock is trade is so fun because it is an actually fun thing in a, you know, day in, day out kind of grind through stocks that, you know, can, can feel a little grinding."", 'Yeah, it can, it can.', 'Well, this is a little rave sunshine.', 'Thanks so much.', 'Appreciate it.', 'All right.', ""Roaring K as we've been talking about bringing the meme trade back to Wall Street and beyond a single post on X sparking a massive rally in gamestop shares with volume hitting its highest level since 2021."", ""It's not just Gamestop as we've been discussing shares of a mc Tupperware."", ""Remember that's a meme stock, Blackberry."", ""They're all moving sharply higher."", 'Joining us now, Tasty Live founder and Ceo Tom S have to talk more about this.', 'Tom.', 'Uh Thanks for being here.', 'Um Are you having fun today too as much?', 'I mean, you heard us just talking about it.', 'What kind of activity and chatter are you seeing today?', ""It's, it's kind of, yeah, of course, I'm having fun, but it's, it's all the chatter we're hearing today."", ""I mean, there really isn't much else, so it's been a slow week, you know, I mean, last week was pretty slow."", ""So this week, um everybody came in all perked up and um yeah, it's kind of dominating the, the story time."", 'Do you see Tom, you know, is this kind of a broader sign of just risk appetite ramping right now to you?', 'And, and if so, do you see that kind of playing out in different data points?', 'Do you see that in the options market?', 'Well, well, for sure, I, I think that it was a, there was a real lack of new ideas, there was a real lack of kind of, you know, there was a lot of complacency in the markets.', 'Like I said, the last two weeks were kind of slow and this rally has been kind of a grind to the upside and balls been crashing.', 'So I think that, you know, it was, this move today was really welcomed by, especially by option traders, but also by kind of everybody just as, you know, just as another level of excitement.', ""I don't, I don't look at this at all like I did in 2021 when it was almost a transformational moment, dragging, you know, tens of millions of people back into the marketplace."", ""That's not what we're seeing today."", ""This is just, you know, this is all the players just um kind of transitioning or, or moving into something that's actually active."", ""This is kind of like the old days on the trading floor when there's a lot of noise in one in one pit, everybody would run to that pit."", ""That's what we're seeing today."", 'Well, Tom, there was another aspect of this whole phenomenon in 2021 which was like the narrative of the little guys trying to stick it to the big guy, right to trying to stick it to hedge funds.', 'And of course, we know Gabe Plotkin um got caught up in that and there was a big short squeeze.', ""What's fascinating to me is today is that there's still a short squeeze that 24% of the company's float was still shorted going into today."", ""According to S3 partners, we're looking at what $936 million in mark to market losses as of earlier today in a single day."", ""Like it's so, it's so interesting to me that there were still that many people shorting this stock kind of quietly in the background."", ""I don't know."", 'Well, first of all, the float is a lot, the, the floats a lot bigger than it was, you know, um, three years ago.', ""And so that is one of the, there's been a couple of splits, there's been, you know, a lot of stock that's been, that's been issued."", ""So it's a very different situation."", 'And you also have to remember that, that those numbers are really misleading because there are huge index fund positions right now.', 'And on the short side of the index funds, because interest rates have been popping up.', ""There's, there is a lot of short stock out there that is just tied into different index arbitrage positions."", 'And, you know, Gamestop is one of the bigger, you know, I uh Russell 2000 stocks.', ""And so you're really talking about a lot of that, that number is mixed in with just, you know, huge R positions and they don't really necessarily not going after gamestop, for example, they're just, they're just shorting the index because it's an R play A and Tom, who, who's in gamestop right now is that retail institution?"", 'Both?', ""Well, I, I would have to think that there's some institutional and some prop speculators, but I would and I also think today you're seeing."", 'So what happens when you have a move?', ""Like what you're seeing today is that a lot of the high frequency firms, um after they learn their lesson in, in 2021 they try to get ahead of it."", ""So a lot of the volume is high frequency firms and market making firms that know that there's going to be customers coming in on the buy side."", ""So they're just trying to get in front of it so that they have some inventory to lay out."", ""So I think that's part of it and that, that's part of the excitement, that's part of the huge volume."", ""But I would say that this is a lot more retail and a lot when we say retail now, you know, it's, it's kind of a mix but, but retail is very customer."", ""And I would say that today there's been a lot of customer interest, especially, like, just in our own office."", ""I'm seeing it."", ""You know, people are talking in a lot of, you know, people that just work here, they're buying, you know, they're buying some gamestop, they're buying some A MC, you know, they're just toying around with them."", ""It's, it's mostly just kind of, it feels like play money, but I feel like that's, we're seeing more of that than we've seen in a long time."", 'And, and what do you think is driving that Tom?', ""Oh, it's just, you know, like I said before, it's just, it's just, there's the markets for traders and, and, you know, I come from, this has been my world for a long time in the trading world."", 'Traders are just attracted to noise.', ""And what's happening today is that there's an incredible amount of noise after being almost, you could hear a pin drop for recently for the last couple of weeks today."", ""All of a sudden there's this, you know, credible amount of noise."", ""It's like a stadium that erupts and you want to know who hit, who hit the home run."", ""Well, that's kind of what you're seeing today and it's just a lot of noise and everybody's attracted to the noise."", 'So all of a sudden, you know, you gotta get involved.',

for everybody in a fun way."", ""I don't know how sustainable it is."", ""Well, that's what I was gonna ask you to on this thing."", ""Now, do you expect what we're seeing here in gamestop to continue, or?"", 'No, you expect it to fizzle out pretty fast.', 'Well, as a, as a hardcore contrarian, I do not think you are going to see this is not going to be a repeat of 2021 and that whole, you know, that crazy meme stock explosion where gamestop went from, you know, $15 to, to 500 back down to, you know, whatever 100 or something.', ""I don't think you're gonna see that."", 'I think this is going to be much, a much more muted version of what we saw and maybe, maybe two or three days.', ""But I don't think there's much more than that."", ""I do not think this is 2021 all over again, but I do think there is an incredible amount of speculative capital out there that is just kind of begging for a shot begging for, you know, um, just, just kind of, I don't, I don't want to call a lottery ticket, but I do think there is a lot of speculative capital out there that's just looking for a play and Tom finally just quickly do you think that regulators are gonna be looking at Keith Gill

year.', 'You can see the stock has moved higher, moved higher again after its most recent earnings.', ""So let's get to why you still like it here."", ""First of all, you say it's still trading at a relatively attractive multiple."", 'Yes.', ""In fact, we're actually carrying estimates 10% above consensus."", ""So it's 11 times consensus and we're at 10 times."", 'And the main reason that were above consensus is that were more optimistic about investment banking.', 'And really Goldman is the pure investment bank of all the investment banks.', ""And I think most people don't appreciate, I used to work at an investment bank."", ""Um and they don't appreciate the synergies between investment banking and capital markets."", 'So when you do deals, then that generates extra trading for the trading operation and you saw that in the first quarter, but really the whole firm just outperformed.', ""Yeah, and let's dig into that a little bit more because we are seeing, we're seeing fixed income uh underwriting."", ""We're seeing also that sort of capital markets are perking up a little bit in some areas."", ""There's a little more M and A coming out, there are a little more initial public offerings."", ""So you think that's going to be good for do?"", 'And even in 25 you just had an A I great A I segment.', ""We think that the A I IP O boom will start in 25 which it normally does because, and that's why the US capital markets are so efficient is that we um you know, high valuations of the public companies generate IP OS."", ""So we think it's a little bit of a longer term play."", ""That's why even though the stock is working now, we don't think it's overvalued and even will get better as we go through the summer have rate cuts, at least from the ECB and then have a rally in 25."", 'Right.', 'And I think our last one was that derivative A I play.', ""There's also the fact that they exited the consumer business and sound."", ""No, now they're even a more, well, they were a pure play then they got into the consumer business."", ""It didn't go so hot and then they got out of it."", ""So they're back to being right."", ""I think that's why the multiples lower like Morgan Stanley trades at 13 times."", 'They were more resilient during the downturn because they have more steady wealth management.', ""Goldman's more is about 80% banking, investment banking and Morgan Stanley is 40."", ""So we think it's time to kind of rotate from the safe, safer."", ""I mean, we wouldn't be out of Morgan Stanley, but we're short."", 'It certainly, but gonna trade pretty well together.', 'But to get more leverage to banking from Goldman Sachs got you a little more.', ""Um uh we always like to talk about what the risk is in this situation and in this case, it's, you know, if markets don't do as well, then they could be a victim of that because they don't have that insulation."", 'Right.', 'This is absolutely a bull market play.', 'I remember when I started on Wall Street at Morgan Stanley during a down cycle in 89 we were turning a 0.4 times buck.', 'I mean, it used to be, these investment banks just got smashed.', 'So they are high beta stocks, 1.2 beta very correlated in the market.', ""If we're wrong about, we're bullish on the market, we have 5750 target."", ""But if we're wrong about that, you don't wanna be in financials and certainly not in investment banks."", 'Got you.', 'And you have, you guys have a pretty decent position and it is our largest position in ICAP.', ""So we're pretty um bullish about it."", ""But it's a sector."", ""We know we're in Manhattan."", 'I worked in investment banking.', 'I understand that, that when things start going, this is just the beginning in our opinion of the, of the boom.', ""All right, let's get to an area you don't necessarily want to be and that's in more in the regional banks."", ""And here we're showing PNC financial is just one example of the regionals which largely have underperformed some of the other, some of the larger financials over the past year."", ""So there you're looking, they don't have the benefit of being as much in the capital."", 'They are 5% to pick on PNC.', ""They're just 5% capital markets."", 'Got you.', ""So that compares with Goldman, that's, that's all, all of it."", 'Right.', 'Exactly.', ""So, one reason there that they're not gonna benefit um net interest margins have been under pressure and talk to us about how that's working for the regionals relative to rates as well."", 'Right.', 'So PNC is forecasting themselves about a 5% decline in net interest margin.', 'And the problem is when rates go up really fast, uh the deposit beta as they call it the or the sensitivity to interest rates start hitting, which is just a complicated way of saying people realize they can get 5%.', ""So they're not gonna leave money in a checking account or a six month CD."", ""So they've seen those outflows which means they, it's just March, it's pressured and also they have slow loan growth too as well."", ""Uh They're probably being conservative about putting credit out right now."", ""So those two things are putting pressure might get better in 25 but you have something that's declining with regionals and something that is booming with the investment bank focused."", 'And also they tend to have less exposure to that interest margin as well.', ""And the other thing, we've all been trying to sort of read the tea leaves on the consumer, you know, in from the payment companies by now paying later from the regional banks themselves from retailers."", ""And it does feel like they're starting to see some deterioration on the on the lower end, at least."", ""Definitely, I mean, if you just think about it, it's sort of, there's a have, and have nots in the US consumer, anybody who owns a home did really well from the inflation and anybody who doesn't did really poorly because they had to pay really high rents that are flat now but not going down."", ""So if your wages didn't keep up, so it's definitely pressure on the lower income consumer unclear how that's gonna unfold."", ""But if you look at the more investment bank oriented, they have particularly Goldman's now getting out of it, they have less exposure to that."", 'These, these large banks, their credit exposure is hard to track.', ""They're not like reeds where you can model every building."", ""So we don't really know what's going on there, but it's a potential downside."", 'And could we see defaults, for example, that would affect rising slowly already?', ""We don't think they're gonna be terrible."", ""But if the Fed didn't cut rates, we might have a slowing economy recession."", 'So we just further risk, um, without the upside, investment bank.', ""And so conversely, we'd like to talk about what could go right for the regionals."", ""And it's what you kind of just referred to that the fed could cut and maybe cut a little more aggressively than expected, right?"", ""If they, if the yield curve de inverts and, and we're well into 25 so the longer term story, the banks are gonna do fine."", ""And by the way, if there's a bull market, they're gonna go up there, risky stock, cyclical stocks."", ""So it's, it's probably could be a situation where invest in 25 maybe investment banking is kind of already full at full force and then it's time to rotate into and, and benefit from the net interest margin slowly getting better in 25."", 'And as for the regionals, do you have any position there?', 'Are you sort of under way?', ""We're, we're intentionally completely out of regionals and then not just in the investment banks, but in the money center banks that tend to be better hedged, less dependent on net interest margin have more capital markets upside."", ""So they're just better positioned in our opinion, in this market."", 'Ok.', ""So let's summarize what you're telling folks, Jay here, you're saying you would recommend buying Goldman Sachs given that reasonable trading, multiple potential benefits from avenues like fixed income, underwriting other capital markets and A I related IP OS coming down the pike and you say avoid regional banks, there's limited upside from capital markets."", ""They're not as exposed."", ""There's possible pressures on profitability from rate cuts and potential for credit metrics to worse."", 'And thanks so much for being here.', 'Good to see you and thank you so much for watching.', 'Goodbye or goodbye.', ""We'll be bringing you new episodes three times a week at 3:30 p.m. Eastern oil edging higher on improving demand from China and the market is waiting on CP I data on Wednesday."", 'Yahoo finances Inez for here with the latest nez.', 'Yeah, Josh.', 'And we did see today wt I up about 1%.', 'We also saw Brent crude higher.', 'Now wt I has been trading within a tight range since around May 2nd.', 'So it did settle above $79 per barrel, Brent crude on our wifi Interactive, settled above $83 per barrel.', 'And we have been seeing oil off of its peak from April.', ""And that's basically because of the unwinding of the geopolitical risk in the Middle East."", ""But nonetheless, a lot of analysts are saying that look Brent crude, it's up 10% year to date around 10% and you are going to see rent ceiling at around $90 per barrel."", ""They do not think that that Brent is going to go past 90 OPEC plus doesn't want it to go that high because then you will see a recession worldwide."", 'So, uh OPEC Plus also, by the way, analysts are expecting the oil alliance to extend its production cuts beyond June and in a sticking with the oil space.', ""But getting company specific here, there are some new developments in the Chevron hes deal and some big if not opposition at least, I don't know, maybe a fly in the ointment here."", ""Yes, that's right."", 'This is from a proxy advisor and proxy advisors are hired by big shareholders like a mutual funds like pension funds to advise them on murder on what they should do, how they should vote in merger deals.', 'And this one is with respect to the Chevron and he deal.', 'So he shareholders are being told by this proxy advisor that they should abstain from, from voting on that acquisition of hes at the end of May.', 'Basically with this proxy adviser saying that this entails that the deal entails risk that it may break down and then there would be no compensation in the end for shareholders.', 'Now I did reach out to Chevron.', 'Chevron said that they look forward to this shareholders voting on this deal.', 'But look this all comes down to the Guyana stake, the operation of hes.', 'This is why Chevron wants to buy Hess and Exxonmobil has taken the companies to arbitration.', 'Basically saying that Exxonmobil has a right of first refusal for that block.', 'Exxonmobil has about a 45% stake in that block and says that it has a right of first refusal for that block.', 'So wait to be seen, what happens with this deal.', 'All right.', 'Thank you so much.', 'Appreciate the update coming up.', 'Stick around more market domination.', 'Still to come.', 'Stocks are mixed just ahead of closing Bell on Wall Street as an investors await.', 'Now key inflation data on Wednesday for more on what to expect from that.', 'April CP I print we wanna welcome in Jim S Miguel ce I cio Jim.', 'It is good to see you.', 'So markets to look at the major averages uh kind of modest moves today, Jim, but we do have that uh big inflation print on Wednesday CP I is on deck.', 'What, what do you expect to, to see there, Jim?', 'And how important is that for the market?', 'Uh Good to see you, Josh.', 'Thanks for having me.', ""I, I'll start with the latter question first."", ""It's very, very important for the market."", 'All eyes definitely focused on on this number.', 'Uh We have three hot prints in a row as most investors are, are aware.', 'Uh And the fed is really running out of room here in order to deliver the cuts that I think most investors would love to see and that the FO MC wants to deliver themselves.', ""So one data point doesn't make a trend, so they're going to need a few more."", ""Uh uh after this one, even if this one does come in light, I will say the, the whisper that we are hearing around Wednesday's numbers that we should expect slightly weaker."", ""But even if we do get it, get something slightly weaker, you're still looking at a three handle on probably both headline and core, still leaving the fed in a, in a pretty tight spot if they would like to see rate cuts coming in calendar year 2024."", 'So Jim, how you then sort of position yourself going into that?', 'Do we just assume that rates are gonna stay where they are for a little bit here and, and sort of strategize, excuse me.', 'Uh accordingly.', ""We're, we're actually taking a little bit of a more pessimistic stance as it, as it comes to rates."", 'Uh We are a little bearish.', 'We do expect a 10 year in particular to try to maybe retest that 5% level that we saw about a year or so ago.', 'Uh and even at the very least get that 20 or so basis points back uh post the last FO MC press conference where really what Chairman Pell went ahead and did is took any talk of a rate hike completely off the table.', ""So uh we know with the trend that we've seen recently, a bit of a reeler in inflation, the market began pricing in, you know, the probability however small of a potential rate hike coming in here."", 'Uh uh Pal went ahead and squashed that and we have a 10 year kind of rallying below 450.', ""So, you know, from a positioning perspective, we're, you know, we're taking, you know, relatively modest moves at the margin, but our view is for rates actually higher between now and the end of the year."", 'You know, Jim, we talked about that CP I print this week but another date on the calendar for investors is uh NVIDIA, their earnings are coming up as well.', 'Could that be a catalyst for the market, Jim?', ""Uh I think it absolutely, uh could be looked at it's, if you take a look back, uh the last 12 months, maybe even 18 months, NVIDIA is in, in one way, kind of all that's really mattered."", ""I mean, as much as we talk about the magnificent seven and whether that's turned into the, I don't know, the fab four now or the terrific three, whatever they, who's ever left standing."", 'NVIDIA is clearly the juggernaut uh of the bunch.', ""So you, you're trading at the 4050 times kind of forward earnings."", ""Uh When we look at, when we look at that as a possible event, we're looking at that relative to the fix."", ""So, uh, equity volatility we think has been unusually low, given everything else that's kind of happening in the world and just given the overall importance of, of this one individual name, uh the earnings, the percentage of investment, the percentage of earnings that this one name, the percentage of performance, I should say year to date that this one name has been, uh, has delivered and delivered."", 'Uh not just year to date but also in 2023.', 'Uh a lot of uh a lot of importance riding on this one number.', ""Um Jim can talk to us about utilities a little bit because that's an area that has been rallying."", 'I believe you like it as well.', ""Um Why, you know, and this is not typically a group that does well when rates are high Um, do you think it's gonna be able to continue to run here?"", ""Yeah, we're a little skeptical on that."", ""So, we're, we're kind of neutral utilities."", ""Um, it, I think you're, it's, it's a great point, Julie because, you know, this, this hook in the utility performance, if you track the chart on Yahoo Finance, you know, you, you can see that, uh, it's been pretty, pretty recent rally there."", 'Uh, and I think a lot of that has to do with this kind of doves stance that the FO MC came out with.', ""So everybody knows we started the year with these huge expectations, six rate cuts kind of kind of priced in or, or, or investors trying to bake in the cake for 2024 that's been walked all the way back."", 'Uh Now we put a few more back on.', 'Uh Thanks to the Ds from the last press conference and I think you utility is always a bit of an income play.', ""Uh whenever there's expectations for lower rates, you would expect utilities to kind of hang in there."", ""And that's what we've seen recently, especially with that uh kind of strong uh performance post uh press conference."", ""So, Jim, you said you're a bit skeptical of utilities."", 'What, where do you see opportunity right now, Jim, what, what sectors look attractive?', 'Yeah, it all kind of goes back to the same point which is uh kind of our view for rates.', 'We, we you know, we think rates have higher, we think inflation is going to be stickier for longer.', ""Uh And if we have that view, that's gonna probably not too surprisingly lead us in to the direction of more kind of value type names and what represents kind of good value right now."", 'Uh It is financials uh good conversation in the last segment uh on financials, very, very diverse uh part of the market for sure.', 'Investment banks, money center banks look pretty attractive right now.', 'Forward earnings and twelves and thirteens and fourteens relative to the broader market at uh 22.', ""Uh We're also looking at things like materials and energy."", ""So uh things that really have aren't overly geared to an interest rate kind of move or at the very least are gonna benefit."", 'Uh If we do see uh rates kind of drift higher uh from where they are today, Jim, thanks so much for joining the show today.', 'Appreciate your time.', ""Thank you while wrapping up today's market domination."", ""Don't go anywhere."",

Anytime a bellwether stock like Starbucks takes a significant hit, a prudent investor will look to see if it's a possible bounce-back candidate. So, let's dive into Starbucks' latest earnings, its management's turnaround strategy, and valuation to see whether the stock is a buy or sell."", ""Starbucks recently released its fiscal 2024's second-quarter earnings report, in which the beverage retailer generated $8.6 billion in revenue. That marked a 2% year-over-year decline, partly attributed to a 6% decrease in transactions. Additionally, Starbuck's net income declined 15% from $908 million a year ago to $772 million in the latest quarter as its operating expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, and general and administrative expenses all increased."", 'Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan wrote that the quarter ""did not meet our expectations."" As a result, the company updated its fiscal 2024 revenue guidance from 7% to 10% growth to now ""low-single-digits"" growth. Notably, this was the second guidance downgrade after its initial fiscal 2024 outlook of ""the low end of 10% to 12%"" growth. Generally, anytime a company\'s management downgrades its outlook in two consecutive quarters, it will sow the seeds of doubt about its future growth potential.', 'At the end of March 2024, Starbucks had 38,951 stores globally, representing a 6% year-over-year increase. The company has 61% of its stores in China and the U.S., and management believes the former could be the key to future growth, noting, ""We\'re still at 13 cups per capita. Japan\'s at 280, and the U.S. is at 380.""', 'Additionally, Starbucks has tested opening stores overnight, when its business has traditionally been closed. Management claimed the pilot program doubled its business and believes it could become a $2 billion opportunity over the next five years.', ""While Starbucks' growth drivers may take time to develop, prospective investors would be buying a long-term market-beating stock, currently trading at a substantial discount. Using the standard valuation metric for mature companies, price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the company trades at roughly 21 times earnings, well below its five-year median of 31 times earnings, signaling that the stock is cheap."", ""Additionally, Starbucks prioritizes returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company has paid and raised its dividend for 13 consecutive years and currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.57, representing a near-record high dividend yield of 3.1%. Over the past five years, Starbucks has lowered its share count by roughly 6%, which increases shareholders' ownership stake."", ""Beyond Starbucks' revenue and earnings decline, the hope that China can deliver growth for the company may be overstated. The country demonstrated significant weakness in the second quarter, with comparable-store sales declining 11% and the average ticket dropping 8% year over year compared to North America's decline of 3% and 7%, respectively."", 'Another area for concern is that Starbucks Rewards members dropped from 34.3 million to 32.8 million quarter over quarter. Management pointed to headwinds such as the strained consumer and severe weather as reasons why sales and Starbucks Rewards members fell for its most recent quarter.', 'Starbucks continues to be the global market leader in the coffee industry, but it faces increased competition. The drive-thru coffee chain Dutch Bros, for example, is taking market share in the United States. Its revenue of $275 million during the most recent quarter represented 39% year-over-year growth.', ""Additionally, management's inability to control its earnings guidance is a red flag, demonstrating that it doesn't have the answers to stabilize a business that is always in demand."", ""Given Starbucks' recent stock drop and cheap valuation, current shareholders and prospective investors should both hold steady and wait until management shows it can meet its own expectations before buying."", 'Before you buy stock in Starbucks, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Starbucks wasn’t one of them.

CTVA, Archer Daniels Midland ADM, Alico ALCO and Adecoagro AGRO.', 'Industry: Agriculture Operations', 'Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2272056/4-agriculture-operations-stocks-to-watch-amid-elevated-costs', 'The Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry faces a myriad of challenges that can impact productivity, sustainability and the overall well-being of the industry participants. Fluctuating commodity prices, rising input costs, trade uncertainties and elevated operational expenses have been affecting players for a while. As prices increase across the board, companies within this vital sector are grappling with challenges that impact their operations, profitability and long-term sustainability.', 'However, the industry is poised to benefit from innovations and improved consumer demand for healthy products. Investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and expansions are likely to fortify the prospects of the industry players. Continued investments in assets, and technological capabilities to innovate and serve customers bode well for players like Corteva Inc., Archer Daniels Midland, Alico and Adecoagro.', 'The Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry comprises companies that produce or procure, transport, store, process and distribute agricultural commodities to consumers. It also distributes ingredients to other parts of the agriculture industry (including clothing, animal feed, energy and industrial products). Some industry players engage in dairy operations, land transformation activities and the development of food ingredients using gene-editing technology.', 'The industry encompasses production activities related to traditional farming of crops (like corn, soybean, wheat and cotton), and livestock and poultry products (including meat, dairy and eggs). The products are mainly sold at grocery stores or exported overseas. These are also used as feedstock for other industries. For example, cotton is used in the clothing industry and corn is used in the ethanol industry.', 'Elevated Costs: Industry participants have been witnessing higher costs due to fluctuating commodity prices, rising input costs and trade uncertainties. Supply-chain concerns and commodity cost pressures have been affecting the profitability of agricultural companies for a while. One of the most immediate and tangible impacts of inflation on the agricultural operations industry is the surge in input costs.', 'As inflation has escalated the prices of essential resources, the cost of production for agricultural companies has soared, squeezing profit margins. The companies have resorted to pricing strategies to counter rising raw material costs. The industry participants seek to counter global supply-chain challenges by forming partnerships and distribution strategies. Despite the pricing strategies, commodity cost inflation is expected to continue hurting margins and profitability in the near term.', 'Companies in the industry continue to face raised SG&A expenses due to higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs, commissions and variable compensation. The companies are also witnessing elevated costs for investments in technology and innovation to stay ahead of the race. Continued deleverage in SG&A expenses may continue to have a bearing on the profitability of companies.', 'Agricultural Export Projections: Per the U.S. Department of Agriculture, agricultural export projections for fiscal 2024 (ending Sep 30, 2024) of $170.5 billion marks an increase of $1 billion from the November 2023 forecast of $169.5 billion. The export forecasts have been revised on exports of livestock and dairy, as well as grains and feeds. This is likely to more than offset the reductions in oilseeds and products.', 'Robust Demand Trends for Organic Products: The industry has benefited from an organic movement prompted by consumers’ increasing demand for healthier food. Agriculturists are adopting organic production techniques, and curtailing the use of chemicals and pesticides. Innovations in food processing, improved grain-handling techniques, larger storage spaces and strong emerging market demand are conducive to the industry’s growth.', 'Healthy eating habits are likely to accelerate purchasing and consuming alternative proteins. Focus on nourishment and wellness is pushing microbiome solutions to the forefront. The companies have been investing in acquisitions and joint ventures to build top-notch ingredients and solutions for meeting the demand for healthy products.', 'The Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry is a 13-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #148, which places it in the bottom 41% of more than 250 Zacks industries.', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.', 'The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries resulted from a negative aggregate earnings outlook for the constituent companies. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.', 'Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let us look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.', 'In a year, the Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry has underperformed the S&P 500 and the Zacks Consumer Staples sector.', 'The stocks in the industry have collectively fallen 16.4% in a year against growth of 25.7% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.

The company has lost 16.6% in the past year.', 'Alico: The Fort Myers, FL-based agri-business and land management company is poised to benefit from the strong consumption of not-from-concentrate orange juice by retail consumers, which has been sturdy.

Today, Southwest Airlines stock trades 58% below all-time highs, valuing the company at a market cap of $16 billion. However, I don’t believe Southwest Airlines stock is a good buy at its current valuation. I am bearish on Southwest Airlines due to its exposure to Boeing (NYSE:BA), narrowing earnings, and high balance sheet debt.', 'In early 2020, governments all around the world were forced to shut their borders to limit the spread of the dreaded virus. To remain operational, airline companies increased balance sheet debt while revenue and cash flows fell significantly.', 'While global travel resumed by late 2021, central banks hiked interest rates to offset inflation, both of which touched multi-year highs in 2022. The triple whammy of high debt, interest rates, and inflation has impacted the profitability of Southwest Airlines and its peers, even though travel demand staged a remarkable comeback in a post-pandemic world.', 'Southwest Airlines is among the largest airline companies in the world. It operates and manages a fleet of passenger aircraft. Moreover, it offers ancillary services such as early bird check-in, upgraded boarding, and transportation of pets and unaccompanied minors.', 'The ongoing pullback has meant that LUV stock has returned just 19% to shareholders in the past decade (see below), trailing the S&P 500 Index (SPX), which has more than tripled investor returns after adjusting for dividends.', 'Southwest operates an all-Boeing fleet and relies heavily on the aircraft manufacturers’ line of 737 planes. However, the 737 aircraft have wrestled with a range of issues in the last five years. For instance, several countries grounded 737 Max 8 jets in 2019 and 2020 after two fatal crashes were reported in a span of six months, raising concerns over the safety of these jets.', 'Earlier this year, Boeing came under fire again after an Alaska Airlines flight (a Boeing 737 Max 9) landed 10 minutes after takeoff because a window panel blew out.', 'In fact, over a dozen equipment problems involving Boeing have been reported since 2012 as it continues to lose market share to Airbus.', 'Now, Boeing is wrestling with production delays and pressure from regulators, which is hurting companies such as Southwest Airlines.', 'Last month, Southwest Airlines announced its Q1 results for 2024, reporting a wider-than-expected loss, and warned that airplane delays from Boeing would hamper near-term growth. Southwest Airlines reported revenue of $6.33 billion and a loss of $0.36 per share. Comparatively, analysts forecast Q1 revenue at $6.42 billion and a loss of $0.34 per share.', 'The airline expects to grow its capacity by 4% in 2024, lower than its previous guidance of 6%. It also estimates revenue to decline by 3.5% year-over-year in Q2 of 2024.', 'Southwest Airlines emphasized that it now expects to receive 20 737 Max 8 planes from Boeing, much lower than its previous forecast of 46 planes. So, Southwest will have to delay retiring older jets as it also looks to reduce costs amid a challenging operating environment.', 'Additionally, Southwest Airlines announced it would shut down operations at airports such as Houston’s George Bush International and New York’s Syracuse. The airline carrier is also scaling back operations in Atlanta and Chicago.', 'In its earnings release, Southwest CEO Bob Jordan explained, “The recent news from Boeing regarding further aircraft delivery delays presents significant challenges for both 2024 and 2025. We are reacting and replanning quickly to mitigate the operational and financial impacts while maintaining dependable flight schedules for our customers.”', 'Southwest Airlines stated that it has re-planned its capacity for the next two years due to Boeing’s delivery delays. However, it warned investors and explained that there is no assurance that Boeing will meet its most recent delivery schedule.', 'Southwest Airlines ended Q1 with $8 billion in total outstanding debt and $11.5 billion in liquidity. Southwest must generate enough cash flow to service its debt and make regular interest payments. However, the company reported a free cash outflow of almost $700 million in Q1, making investors nervous.', 'A negative free cash flow figure limits Southwest Airlines’ ability to reinvest in growth or lower balance sheet debt. If Southwest Airlines continues to report negative free cash flow, it would reduce total liquidity levels and drive its valuation lower.', 'Out of the 14 analyst ratings given to LUV stock, five are Buys, nine are Holds, and one is a Sell, indicating a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average LUV stock price target\xa0is $30.59, indicating upside potential of 9.3% from current levels.', 'Nonetheless, LUV stock is forecast to end 2024 with adjusted earnings of $1.16 per share, indicating a forward earnings multiple of 23.7x, higher than the sector median of 19x.', 'Prior to the pandemic, Southwest was one of the best growth stocks in the airline sector.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX), Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET) and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Boston Scientific shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past year (+37.3% vs. -1.7%). The company is witnessing strength across target markets, despite macroeconomic concerns, currency headwinds and related cost inflation.Strong worldwide demand for its Electrophysiology and Structural Heart lines, traction in Europe for its the next generation WATCHMAN FLX, as well as contribution from accretive acquisitions are important drivers. The Pain and Brain franchisees are expected to gain solid traction in 2024 banking on strong execution of core growth strategies.The Electrophysiology arm received a strong boost on the FDA approval for FARAPULSE. The 2024 guidance indicating strong growth over 2023 builds confidence in the stock. On the flip side, mounting costs due to worldwide geopolitical issues are major concerns. FX headwinds continue to largely offset the company’s performance.(You can read the full research report on Boston Scientific here >>>)Shares of Arista Networks have outperformed the Zacks Communication - Components industry over the past six months (+45.9% vs. +37.2%). The company reported healthy first-quarter results with solid top and bottom-line growth year over year, driven by robust demand trends. Easing supply chain woes and steady customer additions backed by the company’s best-in-class portfolio strength ensured top-line expansion, while steady margin improvement contributed to earnings growth.Both the bottom and the top lines beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Arista is likely to benefit from a software-driven, data-centric approach that helps customers build their cloud architecture and enhance the cloud experience. It expects a healthy improvement in gross margin, owing to the optimization of manufacturing output.However, fierce competition in cloud networking solutions market is worrisome. Cautious spending behavior, primarily from cloud titan customers, is another concern.(You can read the full research report on Arista Networks here >>>)Palo Alto Networks shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+54.2% vs. +48.0%). The company has been benefiting from continuous deal wins and the increasing adoption of its next-generation security platforms, attributable to the rise in the hybrid work environment and the heightened need for stronger security.PANW’s strong back-to-back quarterly performances reflect its sustained focus on product innovation, a shift in its business model to subscription-based services, platform integration and continued investments in the go-to-market strategy. The normalization of the supply chain is also aiding growth across the Products, Services and Subscription segments.However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds might hurt its near-term prospects. Forex headwinds and higher marketing and sales expenses are likely to continue hurting its profitability. Also, high acquisition-related expenses are denting margins.(You can read the full research report on Palo Alto Networks here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include HCA Healthcare, Inc.

continue, or?"", 'No, you expect it to fizzle out pretty fast.', 'Well, as a, as a hardcore contrarian, I do not think you are going to see this is not going to be a repeat of 2021 and that whole, you

play."", ""That's why even though the stock is working now, we don't think it's overvalued and even will get better as we go through the summer have rate cuts, at least from the ECB and then have a rally in 25."", 'Right.', 'And I think our last one was that derivative A I play.', ""There's also the fact that they exited the consumer business and sound."", ""No, now they're even a more, well,

know we're in Manhattan."", 'I worked in investment banking.', 'I understand that, that when things start going, this is just the beginning in our opinion of the, of the boom.', ""All right, let's get to an area you don't necessarily want to be and that's in more in the regional banks."", ""And here we're showing PNC financial is just one example of the regionals which largely have underperformed some of the other, some of the larger financials over the past year."", ""So there you're looking, they don't have the benefit of being as much in the capital."", 'They are 5% to pick on PNC.', ""They're just 5% capital markets."", 'Got you.', ""So that compares with Goldman, that's, that's all, all of it."", 'Right.', 'Exactly.', ""So, one reason there that they're not gonna benefit um net interest margins have been under pressure and talk to us about how that's working for the regionals relative to rates as well."", 'Right.', 'So PNC is forecasting themselves about a 5% decline in net interest margin.', 'And the problem is when rates go up really fast, uh the deposit beta as they call it the or the sensitivity to interest rates start hitting, which is just a complicated way of saying people realize they can get 5%.', ""So they're not gonna leave money in a checking account or a six month CD."", ""So they've seen those outflows which means they, it's just March, it's pressured and also they have slow loan growth too as well."", ""Uh They're probably being conservative about putting credit out right now."", ""So those two things are putting pressure might get better in 25 but you have something that's declining with regionals and something that is booming with the investment bank focused."", 'And also they tend to have less exposure to that interest margin as well.', ""And the other thing, we've all been trying to sort of read the tea leaves on the consumer, you know, in from the payment companies by now paying later from the regional banks themselves from retailers."", ""And it does feel like they're starting to see some deterioration on the on the lower end, at least."", ""Definitely, I mean, if you just think about it, it's sort of, there's a have, and have nots in the US consumer, anybody who owns a home did really well from the inflation and anybody who doesn't did really poorly because they had to pay really high rents that are flat now but not going down."", ""So if your wages didn't keep up, so it's definitely pressure on the lower income consumer unclear how that's gonna unfold."", ""But if you look at the more investment bank oriented, they have particularly Goldman's now getting out of it, they have less exposure to that."", 'These, these large banks, their credit exposure is hard to track.', ""They're not like reeds where you can model every building."", ""So we don't really know what's going on there, but it's a potential downside."", 'And could we see defaults, for example, that would affect rising slowly already?', ""We don't think they're gonna be terrible."", ""But if the Fed didn't cut rates, we might have a slowing economy recession."", 'So we just further risk, um, without the upside, investment bank.', ""And so conversely, we'd like to talk about what could go right for the regionals."", ""And it's what you kind of just referred to that the fed could cut and maybe cut a little more aggressively than expected, right?"", ""If they, if the yield curve de inverts and, and we're well into 25 so the longer term story, the banks are gonna do fine."", ""And by the way, if there's a bull market, they're gonna go up there, risky stock, cyclical stocks."", ""So it's, it's probably could be a situation where invest in 25 maybe investment banking is kind of already full at full force and then it's time to rotate into and, and benefit from the net interest margin slowly getting better in 25."", 'And as for the regionals, do you have any position there?', 'Are you sort of under way?', ""We're, we're intentionally completely out of regionals and then not just in the investment banks, but in the money center banks that tend to be better hedged, less dependent on net interest margin have more capital markets upside."", ""So they're just better positioned in our opinion, in this market."", 'Ok.', ""So let's summarize what you're telling folks, Jay here, you're saying you would recommend buying Goldman Sachs given that reasonable trading, multiple potential benefits from avenues like fixed income, underwriting other capital markets and A I related IP OS coming down the pike

few more."", ""Uh uh after this one, even if this one does come in light, I will say the, the whisper that we are hearing around Wednesday's numbers that we should expect slightly weaker."", ""But even if we do get it, get something slightly weaker, you're still looking at a three handle on probably both headline and core, still leaving the fed in a, in a pretty tight spot if they would like to see rate cuts coming in calendar year 2024."", 'So Jim, how you then sort of position yourself going into that?', 'Do we just assume that rates are gonna stay where they are for a little bit here and, and sort of strategize, excuse me.', 'Uh accordingly.', ""We're, we're actually taking a little bit of a more pessimistic stance as it, as it comes to rates."", 'Uh We are a little bearish.', 'We do expect a 10 year in particular to try to maybe retest that 5% level that we saw about a year or so ago.', 'Uh and even at the very least get that 20 or so basis points back uh post the last FO MC press conference where really what Chairman Pell went ahead and did is took any talk of a rate hike completely off the table.', ""So uh we know with the trend that we've seen recently, a bit of a reeler in inflation, the market began pricing in, you know, the probability however small of a potential rate hike coming in here."", 'Uh uh Pal went ahead and squashed that and we have a 10 year kind of rallying below 450.', ""So, you know, from a positioning perspective, we're, you know, we're taking, you know, relatively modest moves at the margin, but our view is for rates actually higher between now and the end of the year."", 'You know, Jim, we talked about that CP I print this week but another date on the calendar for investors is uh NVIDIA, their earnings are coming up as well.',

kind of all that's really mattered."", ""I mean, as much as we talk about the magnificent seven and whether that's turned into the, I don't know, the fab four now or the terrific three, whatever they, who's ever left standing."", 'NVIDIA is clearly the juggernaut uh of the bunch.', ""So you, you're trading at the 4050 times kind of forward earnings."", ""Uh When we look at, when we look at that as a possible event, we're looking at that relative to the fix."", ""So, uh, equity volatility we think has been unusually low, given everything else that's kind of happening in the world and just given

to date that this one name has been, uh, has delivered and delivered."", 'Uh not just year to date but also in 2023.', 'Uh a lot of uh a lot of importance riding on this one number.', ""Um Jim can talk to us about utilities a little bit because that's an area that has been rallying."", 'I believe you like it as well.', ""Um Why, you know, and this is not typically a group that does well when rates are high Um, do you think it's gonna be able to continue to run here?"", ""Yeah, we're a little skeptical on that."", ""So, we're, we're kind of neutral utilities."", ""Um, it, I think you're, it's, it's a great point, Julie because, you know, this, this hook in the utility performance, if you track the chart on Yahoo Finance, you know, you, you can see that, uh, it's been pretty, pretty recent rally there."", 'Uh, and I think a lot of that has to do with this kind of doves stance that the FO MC came out with.', ""So everybody knows we started the year with these huge expectations, six rate cuts kind of kind of priced in or, or, or investors trying to bake in the cake for 2024 that's been walked all the way back."", 'Uh Now we put a few more back on.', 'Uh Thanks to the Ds from the last press conference and I think you utility is always a bit of an income play.', ""Uh whenever there's expectations for lower rates, you would expect utilities to kind of hang in there."", ""And that's what we've seen recently, especially with that uh kind of strong uh performance post uh press conference."", ""So, Jim, you said you're a bit skeptical of utilities."", 'What, where do you see opportunity right now, Jim, what, what sectors look attractive?', 'Yeah, it all kind of goes back to the same point which is uh kind of our view for rates.', 'We, we you know, we think rates have higher, we think inflation is going to be stickier for longer.', ""Uh And if we have that view, that's gonna probably not too surprisingly lead us in to the direction of more kind of value type names

As part of Good Buy or Goodbye, Infrastructure Capital Advisors CEO Jay Hatfield joins Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman in-studio to highlight the investment opportunities found in financial institutions, namely Goldman Sachs (GS)"", ""Goldman is Hatfield's champion among investment banks, pointing to its year-to-date outperformance, its position as a derivative AI play, and IPO market forecasts."", '""We think that the AI IPO boom will start in [2025], which it normally does because that\'s why the US capital markets are so efficient, is that high valuations of the public companies generate IPOs,"" Hatfield states. ""So we think it\'s a little bit of a longer-term play. That\'s why even though the stock is working now, we don\'t think it\'s overvalued and even will get better as we go through the summer, have rate cuts at least from the ECB [European Central Bank], and then have a rally in \'25.""', 'On the other hand, Hatfield is bearish on regional banks, citing the higher rate environment and pressures on the credit market.', ""Catch more of Yahoo Finance's Good Buy or Goodbye, or watch this full episode of Market Domination."", 'This post was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.', ""It's a big noisy universe of stocks out there."", 'Welcome to, goodbye or goodbye.', 'Our goal to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio.', 'They were passing through the banking sector and joining me here to discuss is Jay Hatfield, infrastructure capital advisors, CEO J come on down here so we can get you the stocks that you like.', 'First.', ""Let's start there and it's Goldman Sachs."", 'So Goldman Sachs interestingly has already had a pretty good run over the past year.', 'You can see the stock has moved higher, moved higher again after its most recent earnings.', ""So let's get to why you still like it here."", ""First of all, you say it's still trading at a relatively attractive multiple."", 'Yes.', ""In fact, we're actually carrying estimates 10% above consensus."", ""So it's 11 times consensus and we're at 10 times."", ""And the main reason that we're above consensus is that we're more optimistic about investment banking and really Goldman is the pure investment bank of all the investment banks."", ""And I think most people don't appreciate, I used to work at an investment bank."", ""Um and they don't appreciate the synergies between investment, banking and capital markets."", 'So when you do deals, then that generates extra trading for the trading operation and you saw that in the first quarter, but really the whole firm just outperformed.', 'Yeah.', ""And let's dig into that a little bit more because we are seeing that we're seeing fixed income uh underwriting."", ""We're seeing also that sort of capital markets are perking up a little bit in some areas."", ""There's a little more M and A coming out there are a little more initial public offerings."", ""So you think that's going to be good for me, do."", 'And even in 25 you just had an A I great A I segment.', ""We think that the A I IP boom will start in 25 which it normally does because, and that's why the US capital markets are so efficient is that we um you know, high valuations of the public companies generate IP OS."", ""So we think it's a little bit of a longer term play."", ""That's why even though the stock is working now, we don't think it's overvalued and even will get better as we go through the summer have rate cuts, at least from the ECB and then have a rally in 25 right?"", 'And I think our last one was that derivative A I play.', ""There's also the fact that they exited the consumer business and sound."", ""No, now they're even a more, well, they were a pure play then."", 'They got into the consumer business.', ""It didn't go so hot and then they got out of it."", ""So they're back to being right."", ""And I think that's why the multiples lower, like Morgan Stanley trades at 13 times."", 'They were more resilient during the downturn because they have more steady wealth management.', ""Goldman's more is about 80% banking, investment banking and Morgan Stanley is 40."", ""So we think it's time to kind of rotate from the safe safer."", ""I mean, we wouldn't be out of Morgan Stanley, but we're short."", 'It certainly, but gonna trade pretty well together.', 'But to get more leverage to banking from Goldman Sachs got you a little more.', ""Um uh we always like to talk about what the risk is in this situation and in this case, it's, you know, if markets don't do as well, then they could be a victim of that because they don't have that insulation, right."", 'This is absolutely a bull market play.', 'I remember when I started on Wall Street at Morgan Stanley during a down cycle in 89 we were turning a 0.4 times buck.', 'I mean, it used to be these investment banks just got smashed.', 'So they are high beta stocks, 1.2 beta, very correlated in the market.', ""If we're wrong about, we're bullish on the market, we have 5750 target."", ""But if we're wrong about that, you don't wanna be in financials and certainly not in investment banks got you and you have, you guys have a pretty decent position and it is our largest position in icap."", ""So we're pretty um bullish about it, but it's a sector we know we're in Manhattan."", 'I worked in investment banking.', 'I understand that, that when things start going, this is just the beginning in our opinion of the boom.', ""All right, let's get to an area you don't necessarily want to be."", ""And that's in more in the regional banks."", ""And here we're showing PNC financial is just one example of the regionals which largely have underperformed some of the other, some of the larger financials over the past year."", ""So there you're looking, they don't have the benefit of being as much in the capital."", ""They're 5% to pick on PNC."", ""They're just 5% capital markets."", 'Got you.', 'So that compares with Goldman.', ""That's, that's all all of it."", 'Right.', 'Exactly.', ""So one reason there that they're not gonna benefit um net interest margins have been under pressure and talk to us about how that's working for the regionals relative to rates as well, right."", 'So PNC is forecasting themselves about a 5% decline in net interest margin.', 'And the problem is when rates go up really fast, uh the deposit beta as they call it the or the sensitivity to interest rates start hitting, which is just a complicated way of saying people realize they can get 5%.', ""So they're not gonna leave money in a checking account or a six month CD."", ""So they've seen those outflows, which means they, it's just March, it's pressured and also they have slow loan growth too as well."", ""Uh They're probably being conservative about putting credit out right now."", 'So those two things are putting pressure might get better in 25.', ""But you have something that's declining with regionals and something that is booming with the investment bank focused And also they tend to have less exposure to that interest margin as well."", ""And the other thing, we've all been trying to sort of read the tea leaves on the consumer, you know, in from the payment companies by now paying later from the regional banks themselves, from retailers."", ""And it does feel like they're starting to see some deterioration on the, on the lower end, at least."", 'Definitely.', ""I mean, if you just think about it, it's sort of there's a have and have nots in the US consumer, anybody who owns a home did really well from the inflation and anybody who doesn't did really poorly because they had to pay really high rents that are flat now but not going down."", ""So if your wages didn't keep up, so it's definitely pressure on the lower income consumer unclear how that's gonna unfold."", ""But if you look at the more investment bank oriented, they have particularly Goldman's now getting out of it, they have less exposure to that."", 'These, these large banks their credit exposure is hard to track.', ""They're not like reeds where you can model every building."", ""So we don't really know what's going on there, but it's a potential downside."", 'And could we see defaults, for example, that would affect, rising slowly already?', ""We don't think they're going to be terrible, but if the fed didn't cut rates, we might have a slowing economy recession."", 'So we just further risk, um, without the upside of investment bank.', ""And so conversely, we'd like to talk about what could go right for the regionals and it's what you kind of just referred to that the fed could cut and maybe cut a little more aggressively than expected, right?"", ""If they, if the yield curve de inverts and, and we're well into 25."", 'So the longer term story, the banks are gonna do fine.', ""And by the way, if there's a bull market, they're gonna go up there risky stock, cyclical stocks."", ""So it's, it's probably could be a situation where invest in 25 maybe investment banking is kind of already full at full force and then it's time to rotate into and, and benefit from the net interest margin slowly getting better in 25."", 'And as for the regionals, do you have any position there?', ""Are you sort of under way, we're, we're intentionally completely out of regionals and in not just in the investment banks but in the money center banks that tend to be better hedged less dependent on net interest margin have more capital markets upside."", ""So they're just better positioned in our opinion, in this market."", 'Ok.', ""So let's summarize what you're telling folks, Jay here."", ""You're saying you would recommend buying Goldman Sachs given that reasonable trading, multiple potential benefits from avenues like fixed income, underwriting other capital markets and A I related IP OS coming down the pike and you say avoid regional banks, there's limited upside from capital markets."", ""They're not as exposed."", ""There's possible pressures on profitability from rate cuts and potential for credit metrics to worse."", 'And thanks so much for being here.', 'Good to see you and thank you so much for watching.', 'Goodbye or goodbye.', 'We will be bringing you new episodes three times a week

Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to begin our call today by emphasizing the important strides we have made to further our One Perrigo strategy, deliver on our purpose to make lives better through trusted health and wellness solutions accessible to all. Let's start by recapping our quarter one results against the expectations that we discussed in our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. First, we planned that actions to augment and strengthen our infant formula business would have an impact on our first quarter EPS and they did. While infant formula actions drove an EPS headwind of $0.30 versus the prior year, first quarter EPS was approximately $0.06 ahead of our projection due to timing of infant formula shipments to customers."", 'Actions taken in infant formula were impactful, but necessary. The significant progress we have made sets us up well to achieve a quality controlled, reliable manufacturing environment, though there is much more work to be done. I believe that the quality and compliance actions and investments we have taken will strengthen our competitive position in the industry over the long term. Also, as expected, SKU prioritization actions in CSCA weighed on quarter one organic net sales and EPS growth. However, these actions had multiple benefits, including gross margin expansion of 50 basis points across the enterprise in quarter one, greater focus on more profitable areas of our portfolio and provides additional production capacity as we build out our blended branded business.', ""Next, as highlighted on our last earnings call, US OTC retail inventories were above average entering quarter one. As expected, retailer inventory destocking led to lower shipments of product to customers compared to prior year. Encouragingly, consumption across Perrigo's US OTC business remained healthy at plus 1.9% over the last 13 weeks ending March '24. Based on current consumption trends, we believe that retail inventory levels should normalize during quarter two. Finally, CSCI continues to fire on all cylinders. Organic net sales in the quarter grew 7% and operating margin expanded 290 basis points versus last year to 19.7%. Collectively, the first quarter was a good start to the year as we delivered against our commitments and we remain on track to achieve our goals in 2024."", 'Turning to our first quarter financial highlights. As just discussed, first quarter net sales were heavily impacted by infant formula in addition to SKU prioritization actions to enhance margins as part of our supply chain reinvention program. These factors caused a decline in reported net sales of more than 8%. Organic net sales declined 7%, which comprised three major components, an impact of minus 4.3 percentage points from infant formula, an impact of minus 3.6 percentage points from SKU prioritization actions and organic net sales growth of plus 1 point from the rest of our business, driven by strong performance in CSCI and the launch of Opill. Quarter one gross margin declined 90 basis points to 36.5%, which comprised an unfavorable 280 basis points impact from infant formula, 50 basis points benefit from SKU prioritization actions and a 140 basis point benefit from the rest of the business led by gross margin expansion in US OTC and oral care.', ""As I said, first quarter EPS was ahead of projection, but was down $0.16 from a year ago to $0.29 per share. Infant formula had an unfavorable $0.30 per share impact and SKU prioritization actions had an additional $0.06 impact. These headwinds more than offset EPS growth of $0.20 per share in the rest of the business. Digging a bit deeper into net sales, we delivered solid performance in women's health which was led by the US launch of Opill. And in skincare, which benefited from robust growth in our Compeed and Mederma brands. Compeed achieved net sales growth of 56%, not incorporating distributor transitions that impacted sales in the prior year, driven by market share gains and the successful product line extension of Compeed Spots. Mederma net sales grew 51% in the quarter, driven by Mederma Cold Sore which added incremental sales to the brand and strong growth in e-commerce."", ""Net sales across most global categories was impacted by SKU prioritization actions in CSCA, which weighed most heavily on skincare, pain and sleep aids and digestive health. Inventory destocking at US retail customers also affected growth as I just discussed. This impact was most notable in cough-cold due to a lighter season than prior year and industry wide supply chain recoveries. Quick note on the US allergy season. There has been a recent uptick in incidence levels and consumption over the past 13 weeks. A strong and prolonged allergy season could drive the need for customer replenishment even as US retail inventories normalize. If a strong season does materialize, we're in a very good position to take advantage. Looking at our 2024 operational priorities, I'm pleased to say we remain well on track."", 'First, we are making good progress augmenting and strengthening our infant formula business and are working to recover manufacturing volumes. We also executed the nationwide launch of Opill in the US. More details on both of those in a few moments. We also continue to benefit from accretive priorities. First, we are on track to deliver a total of $25 million in incremental HRA synergies as we complete integration activities. Second, our supply chain reinvention program drove gross savings of $12 million in the quarter and gross margin expansion of 50 basis points from SKU prioritization actions. And third, Project Energize attained $17 million of cost savings in the quarter and we remain on target to deliver $140 million to $170 million in pre-tax annualized savings by 2026.', 'Turning to infant formula. As the leading US manufacturer of store brand formula, Perrigo plays a critical role in the health and wellness of hundreds of thousands of babies every year. Over the past few months, we have made significant progress to augment and strengthen our infant formula manufacturing network. This included, in some instances, pausing production for comprehensive cleaning and infrastructure improvements, in addition to enhancements of quality protocols and manufacturing processes. At this point, any planned large scale product resets have been completed and we are progressing to the next phase of our quality and operational enhancements. This next phase includes further policy and procedural enhancements at the site level.', ""In addition, we are making further investments in infrastructure and people as appropriate. Importantly, we do not expect this continuing body of work to result in extended shutdowns beyond normal maintenance activities. The recovery of manufacturing volumes is expected to continue to build throughout 2024, stemming from longer quality hold times and faster, shorter campaign-style production runs. Those volumes are expected to improve during the second half of this year followed by market share recovery. All of this is in line with our original outlook. Stabilization of infant formula will remain a journey and I'm pleased with the progress we have made. Maintaining quality compliance is core to Perrigo's business and culture. We will continue to invest in quality, capacity and other enhancements as we bolster quality-controlled, reliable manufacturing across our network."", ""With the launch of Opill, Perrigo has taken a historic step for women's health by creating an entirely new OTC category for oral contraceptives in the US. During the quarter, the Opill team executed the most revolutionary and holistic product launch in the history of Perrigo. The launch was broad and Opill can now be found at more than 65,000 retail locations across the US, in addition to major e-commerce retailers. The response to this launch has been truly amazing from customers to academics and now consumers. The Opill launch program encompassed a 360-degree approach to drive awareness. This began with a coordinated pre-launch campaign that drove highly positive sentiment. This resulted in high awareness for Opill even before our full media campaign ramps up over the coming weeks."", ""Through activation plans, strategic partnerships including a newly announced partnership with the WNBA and the increasing support of public and private healthcare plans, Opill is revolutionizing the landscape for women's health. Early Opill consumption and conversion metrics are encouraging. Through the first few weeks of activation, consumer time to conversion on opill.com has been impressive with limited touchpoints. The time to conversion demonstrates that our team has the right strategy in place to guide consumers through their decision journey and promote repeat usage, which will ultimately determine the long-term success of Opill. I'd like to congratulate our team, partners and supporters who played a vital role in the early success of Opill."", ""Perrigo is committed to advancing women's health and will look to further innovate and provide accessible solutions that empower women to take charge of their own self-care journey. Now I would like to share an update on our blueprint for One Perrigo. The work we have conducted to identify our winning portfolio is clarifying how we will leverage our core competencies and strengths within our respective categories. Strategies within each category will depend on the long-term value creation potential and our right to win. These factors will shape various category management objectives including top line growth, profitability and cash generation. To grow across our portfolio, we must continue to invest in innovation, sourcing and new avenues of differentiation to deliver consumer preferred offerings."", ""Work to bolster our innovation pipeline is underway and will take time to fully develop, but we are approaching this objective from a position of strength and will work with our retail partners to lead category growth in the self-care aisle. Our US store brand business remains a cornerstone of the Perrigo portfolio and it's the furnace that will fuel our blended branded business. Given the continuous evolution of the self-care landscape, we are conducting a thorough analysis regarding the position of this business, including network design, capacity utilization and category penetration. Our priorities through fiscal 2025 include relentless execution in our core business to maximize free cash flow generation and de-lever. Key milestones are delivering margin expansion from Project Energize, returning our infant formula business to stable profitable operations, driving favorable outcomes with key customers in our US store brand business."", ""In parallel, we will continue to implement One Perrigo operating model enhancements to build a leaner, more efficient and agile global organization to enable our strategy. Our longer-term objective for 2026 and beyond is to realize our blended branded strategy, a model that delivers sustainable value accretive innovation. We'll have made targeted investments in our highest potential growth opportunities in the most attractive categories and built consumer good capabilities. This will enable a global branded growth with an eye towards accretive margins, cash flow and returns. We look forward to further articulating this strategy at our Investor Day later this year. As you may already seen, Svend Andersen, President of CSCI, will retire from Perrigo later this year."", ""During his seven years leading this business, Svend has played a pivotal role in the success of CSCI by focusing the portfolio, concentrating on innovation and brand extensions, all while making significant contributions to Perrigo's overall growth and development. On behalf of the Board of Directors, management team and everyone at Perrigo, we appreciate all that you have given, Svend, and all that you've done for Perrigo. Svend is handing over a business that has performed very well and I am confident that Roberto will continue to drive success. Roberto Khoury is joining Perrigo later this month and will officially lead CSCI in August. He joins Perrigo from Kenvue and has more than 20 years of experience in branded consumer products, including leadership of pan European brands, accelerating digital and e-commerce capabilities, reducing portfolio complexity and improving integrated planning accuracy."", ""I'm confident in Roberto and his ability to further our One Perrigo strategy. In summary, we remain highly focused on our priorities, including our One Perrigo strategy. We reported a good first quarter and will continue executing against our 2024 operational priorities. We are making great progress in strengthening and augmenting our infant formula network. Opill is off to a fast start and we are on track to deliver our accretive initiatives. We will do this while progressing our blueprint for One Perrego to consumerize, simplify and scale our business, all while focusing on cash returns and deleveraging. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Eduardo to cover the financials."", 'Eduardo Bezerra: Thank you, Patrick. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Looking at the first quarter financials, starting with the GAAP to non-GAAP summary. Company reported GAAP net income of $4 million or $0.03 per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $40 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.29 versus $0.45 in the prior year. Primary adjustments to our first quarter non-GAAP P&L were, first, the removal of $113 million tax benefit, primarily driven by an $84 million benefit related to the planned intercompany sale of intellectual property. Two, amortization expenses of $59 million. And three, restructuring charges of $44 million primarily related to our Project Energize and supply chain reinvention programs.', ""Full details can be found in the non-GAAP reconciliation table attached to today's press release. From this point forward, all financial results discussed will be on an adjusted basis unless otherwise noted. As highlighted, first quarter results were heavily impacted by the actions we're taking to strengthen and augment our infant formula business and SKU prioritization actions to enhance margins. This led to an operating income decline of 22%, excluding the impact of infant formula, adjusted operating income from the rest of the business grew mid teens percent. Let's dig into additional details. Looking at our segment performance during the quarter, CSCI continues to perform well, highlighted by plus 7% organic net sales growth. The strong top line performance was driven by growth in compete and the absence of distributor transitions that unfavorably impacted the prior year."", 'CSCI gross margin was impacted by lower volumes partially in the cough cold category due to supply constraints and lower seasonal incidents across Europe. However, operating margin expanded 290 basis points to 19.7% driven by expense reductions resulting from HRA synergies and ROI focused advertising and promotion spend as part of Project Energize. I too would like to thank Svend for his tremendous efforts and leadership over the years while also welcoming Roberto to the Perrigo team. In CSCA, infant formula and SKU prioritization actions weighted on Q1 performance with net sales down 15.7% and organic net sales down 14.6%. Organic net sales from the rest of the CSCA business declined 2.3% due primarily to US retail inventory destocking across most categories.', ""As Patrick noted, we believe retail inventories should normalize in Q2. First quarter CSCA gross margin declined 280 basis points versus last year, including minus 520 basis points driven by infant formula. The infant formula impact was partially offset by gross margin improvement of plus 10 basis points from SKU prioritization actions and plus 230 basis points expansion from the rest of the business, driven by favorable product mix in US OTC and oral care. Continuing with margins, Perrigo's first quarter gross margin declined 90 basis points, including an impact of minus 280 basis points from infant formula. When excluding these impacts from infant formula, Perrigo achieved a meaningful year-over-year gross margin expansion of plus 190 basis points."", 'All of these translated into operating margin expansion of plus 260 basis points excluding the impact from infant formula. Two central takeaways here. First, the importance of augmenting and strengthening infant formula cannot be overstated. And second, margin across the rest of the business continue to recover and expand. Now to EPS. Infant formula, as expected, had an unfavorable $0.30 per share impact and SKU prioritization actions had an additional $0.06 impact year-over-year. These headwinds more than offset a benefit of $0.20 per share from the rest of the business, which included a reduction of $0.02 from the impact of exited products. Before turning to the balance sheet, a few comments on the proposed divestment of HRA Rare Disease business, which has been a key component of our 2024 deleveraging plan.', 'This proposed divestment further supports our focused consumer self-care portfolio and the business will best flourish as part of ESTEVE Group. We plan to redeploy the upfront proceeds of EUR190 million later this year for debt repayment. Importantly, the financial impact of this proposed divestment was included in our regional 2024 outlook. I would like to thank the HRA Rare Disease’s team for their dedication and focus as they continue improving the lives of patients with rare disease. Cash on the balance sheet at the end of the first quarter was $659 million. First quarter operating cash outflow was $1 million due to infant formula and restructuring costs primarily related to Project Energize. During the quarter, we also invested $25 million in capital expenditures and returned $38 million to shareholders through dividends.', 'Sources and uses of cash for 2024 remain largely intact from our initial outlook, apart from upcoming cash tax payments related to the planned intercompany sale of intellectual property that will benefit the company over the long term. We continue to anticipate operating cash flow conversions for the full year of 90% to 100% of adjusted net income. Looking at the balance of the year, we expect Q2 to be our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to restructuring costs related to Project Energize. In addition, you may have seen that Perrigo recently settled a shareholder lawsuit for $97 million without any concession of liability or wrongdoing. We expect to pay the settlement in the second quarter using cash on hand and are seeking a full recovery from insurance providers this year.', 'In total, we now estimate end cash balance for 2024 of between $500 million and $550 million. Importantly, we continue to expect a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.8 times to 4 times at year-end. Looking at EPS phasing for the year, our expected weighting between the first and second half remains unchanged. As discussed, timing of infant formula shipments realized in the first quarter, which were originally expected in the second quarter are driving a change in our first half phasing. Outside of these, there are no updates to our previous phasing assumptions. Our 2024 outlook for total Perrigo also remains unchanged. Organic net sales growth of 1% to 3% is expected to be driven by new products including Opill, pricing actions and the absence of the HRA distributor transition impacts.', 'These drivers are expected to more than offset volume declines primarily in infant formula and a negative impact of one percentage point to organic growth from SKU prioritization actions. All in, net sales growth is expected to be flat compared to 2023 as organic growth is offset by divested and exited business and products. Excluding infant formula from both years, we continue to expect gross margin expansion in 2024. We are reaffirming our full-year EPS range of $2.50 to $2.65 equating to meetings percentage growth excluding infant formula. In closing, I would like to thank our Perrigo colleagues for their commitment to advancing our One Perego vision and for their continued focus on achieving our 2024 priorities.

No matter what the stock market does in the next few months or years, great companies with long-term competitive advantages can deliver wins for long-term investors with the passage of time.', ""The fresh bull market has reinvigorated many investors to add to their portfolios and seize upon new investment opportunities. If you're looking for two top stocks to buy in this new Nasdaq bull market and hold for years, don't overlook these names the next time you add cash to your portfolio."", 'Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) has been the leader in robotic-assisted surgery for over two decades now. The company continues to dominate this space with its market-leading lineup of surgical suites, which revolves around several models of its da Vinci surgical system.', ""A single da Vinci system can run one of Intuitive Surgical's clients upwards of $3 million. That is a significant investment even for large medical providers, so these clients are incentivized to ensure proper training and maintenance of these systems."", 'The systems are usually accompanied by long-term service contracts. These contracts cover services like maintenance and training, and bring in anywhere from $80,000 to $225,000 per contract per year for Intuitive Surgical.', 'Then, the company generates anywhere from $800 to $3,600 of instruments and accessories revenue for every single procedure performed using its da Vinci suite, as these tools need to be replaced on a regular basis. Intuitive Surgical actually makes more money from recurring revenue sources like instruments, accessories, services, and operating leases than it does on actual system sales, lucrative as those are.', 'Looking at the most recent quarter, da Vinci procedure volume rose 16% compared with the same quarter the prior year, and its installed base of systems increased 14% year over year. Revenue for the three-month period totaled just shy of $2 billion, up 11% from one year ago.', 'This is also an insanely profitable business. First-quarter net income according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) came to $545 million, a whopping 54% increase from the same period last year. The company just garnered approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the latest generation of its flagship system, called the da Vinci 5.', ""Some Wall Street analysts think the stock could have anywhere from 13% upside on the median up to 25% upside on the high end over the next 12 months alone. If it's steady returns and a quality healthcare business with a substantial moat you're looking for, Intuitive Surgical hits the nail on the head."", ""Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) has been through a volatile few years, but the streaming giant has demonstrated its resilience despite this period. Its introduction of a cheaper, ad-based tier and crackdowns on password sharing are just a few initiatives that have stood out as it's risen from the doldrums it experienced in the immediate aftermath of its pandemic popularity."", ""Fast-forward to the present, and Netflix is profitable again, while membership and revenue numbers are growing at a steady clip. It's also important to bear in mind that this is a business that still dominates the streaming market even as competition is steep in this space and has eaten into its share."", 'As of the first quarter of this year, Netflix controls more than 44% of the streaming space in the U.S. alone. Bear in mind, the U.S. streaming market is on track to hit a valuation of $55 billion by the year 2027, a compound annual growth rate of about 8% from its current valuation.', 'In its recent quarter, Netflix generated revenue of $9.4 billion, up 15% from one year ago. Net income for the total period came to $2.3 billion, a 79% year-over-year bump. Total membership levels reached just shy of 270 million, a 16% increase from one year prior and compared to the same quarter in 2019 before the pandemic, up 81%.', 'The addition of an ad-based tier in key streaming markets has turned into a notable success for Netflix after sluggish adoption initially. The company reported that its ads membership rose 65% from the prior quarter, after increasing 70% sequentially in the prior two quarters. And 40% of all membership signups in the markets where Netflix offers the ad-based tier are now from ads plans.', ""A recent study conducted by market research firm HarrisX found that Netflix may have up to 22 million ad-based subscribers in the U.S. alone, and up to 30 million globally. That would mean that ad-based subscribers account for about 11% of Netflix's overall subscriber base."", ""Considering this tier is barely 18 months since launch, there's plenty of room to seize up more subscriber dollars while retaining existing customers, particularly as many consumer wallets are more constrained these days than in the past. It looks like a good time to be a Netflix investor, and if you've been holding off on the stock till now, even its premium valuation might still be worth buying into a slice of the action."", 'Before you buy stock in Intuitive Surgical, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intuitive Surgical wasn’t one of them.

""Bridgerton"" creator Shonda Rhimes also signed with the company around that time, locking in a reported $100 million deal.', 'Others soon followed. In 2019, Warner Bros.

The five consecutive declines have taken that price down 21.3 cents a gallon during, and the price is now at a level not seen since the end of January.', 'Whatever impact that oil markets may have felt from the conflict in Gaza, the Iran-Israel back-and-forth and the diversions of shipping away from the Red Sea (which may have faded from the news but continue) are apparently having no impact on oil prices. A reaction to those developments would tend to be macro in nature and would generally impact crude more than products.', 'But market weakness continues to show up in products markets, including diesel. And diesel in particular is getting a great deal of focus of late.', '', 'Diesel is increasingly being viewed as one of the primary reasons for the gradual fall in oil markets that has been occurring since early to mid-April. Whereas a few months ago, the rising price of oil was primarily attributed to a tight market for gasoline, the more recent weakness in oil overall is being laid firmly at the feet of the diesel market.', 'In his weekly report released Sunday, energy economist Philip Verleger noted that diesel weakness is becoming more structural because of the growing role of renewable diesel, which is made not from petroleum but from feedstocks such as plant oils and animal fats, including those captured in grease traps at restaurants.', 'In the report, Verleger noted that weekly EIA data on distillate consumption in the U.S., which is about 90% diesel, has been running anywhere from 400,000 to 600,000 barrels per day less than pre-pandemic levels. While some analysts are looking at that and concluding it is the function of a slow trucking market, Verleger’s report cited the fact that the data isn’t capturing the consumption of renewable diesel.', '“Taxes and regulations promulgated by the US Environmental Protection Agency have prompted refiners to convert crude oil processing facilities to produce renewable diesel, making more renewable fuel available,” Verleger wrote. “The higher renewable diesel use will cut US petroleum consumption. At this juncture, it seems that none of the … most-quoted forecasts of global oil demand have been adjusted to account for this replacement.”', '', 'Refining company earnings calls with analysts often feature management discussion of renewable diesel and its impact on the refiners’ bottom line. For example, on the latest Phillips 66 call, CEO Mark Lashier reviewed the company’s expanding renewable diesel operations and said that as a result of them, “we have gained valuable operational experience and market knowledge that positions us for success in our expanding renewable fuels business.”', 'But on the latest round of calls, talk about the weak diesel market — its crack spread against Brent crude is down about 20 cents a gallon in two months — did arise.', 'The view that diesel demand is weak was rejected by Gary Simmons, the executive vice president and chief operating officer at Valero (NYSE: VLO). He said on the company’s first-quarter earnings calls that diesel sales at Valero are about 2% higher than those of a year ago.', 'But he added that he expects diesel demand will be “flat to slightly down compared to last year.” “However, some of the freight indices appear to be turning, and indicate we could start seeing better demand,” Simmons said.', 'Brian Mandell, executive vice president of marketing and commercial for Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) said on the company’s call that even though Ukraine’s attacks on Russian refining capacity have probably taken about 200,000 barrels per day of Russian diesel supplies off the market, diesel prices have been suppressed by the warm winter in the northeastern U.S. — where heating oil, a distillate, is heavily used for home warmth — and by refiners coming out of maintenance season strong.', 'But the result has been reduction in refinery operating rates in Europe and Asia because of refining margins for distillates, which he said are around breakeven.', 'The weak market for products relative to crude is most visible in the 3-2-1 crack spread, a basic indicator of refinery probability. It is calculated by taking the price of two barrels of gasoline plus one barrel of diesel, converting it to a price per barrel and subtracting the price of crude, either Brent or West Texas Intermediate.', 'The Brent 3-2-1 on Monday, based on CME prices, fell to close to $21 a barrel. Two months ago, in mid-March, it was approximately $29.', '', 'More articles by John Kingston', 'New Class 8 truck orders in April up from a year ago, down from March', 'Truck transportation jobs break 6-month string of gains with slight loss', 'RXO, still suffering from weak market, touts Q1 volume growth', 'The post Diesel takes another hit and may be driving down broader oil market appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

Their extraordinary stock performance over the last several quarters, despite West Texas Intermediate crude oil still being down by around 30% versus its own 2022 high, indicates underlying strength beyond oil prices.', 'In my opinion, oil refiners are attractive stocks to own in a diversified or energy-heavy portfolio, and two of the main refiners are in the best position of the refining sector to outperform in the long term.', 'There are major macro factors that carry large tailwinds in favor of the oil refining stocks, such as global demand growth for energy powered by the high growth of populated countries like India, Indonesia and Brazil. The main U.S.-listed refiners are Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE:VLO), Marathon Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:MPC) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX). Valero manufactures and sells petrochemical products and fuels in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Ireland and Latin America. Marathon focuses primarily on the U.S., while Phillips 66 targets the U.S., U.K. and Germany.', 'Despite the recent performance of the refining sector, it is somewhat overlooked as the low valuation of the refiners indicates. Big oil stocks such as Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) trade closer to a price-earnings ratio of 15, while these main refiners trade in a range of roughly 8 to 11. Market participants are just starting to realize the refiners are trading at a relative discount, and that could explain the excellent performance.', 'Year-to-date stock performance of oil refiners', '20-year stock performance of oil refiners', 'One of the reasons the industry has been overlooked as an energy play is because refining companies do not have the same political weight and, therefore risk, that big oil does. They are also not always subject to the same public protests, or even regulatory measures, that big oil can suffer from because their perceived impact on the environment is lower. Politics aside, we will focus on the hard figures.', 'The following table was compiled based on data extracted from GuruFocus screening tools and we will analyse it in this section, as the most revealing figures are displayed below.', 'Tickers', 'Market Cap ($M)', 'Price-Earnings', 'Price-to-FCF', 'Operating Margin', 'Return on Equity', 'Return on Assets', 'Dividend Yield', 'Current Ratio', 'VLO', '51,286', '7.77', '7.65', '6.78%', '27.14%', '11.32%', '2.63%', '1.59', 'MPC', '64,318', '9.12', '7.61', '6.85%', '31.39%', '9.07%', '1.73%', '1.43', 'PSX', '60,884', '11.05', '22.08', '4.37%', '19.18%', '7.60%', '2.92%', '1.17', 'The three stocks have similar market caps, and hence the comparison is actually fairly easy and relevant to perform. The two favored valuation metrics the markets like to use are price-earnings and price-to-cash flow. We saw in the previous section that Valero and Marathon are currently outperforming year to date and have done so over the last two decades. Despite their multiyear rallies, they remain cheaper than Phillips 66 because their rapid growth rates have continuously kept the valuation multiples down. The price-to-free cash flow ratio is actually even more revealing as Valero and Marathon accumulate more cash that can be reinvested than Phillips 66. Valero ended 2023 with $8.30 billion (down 23.60% from year prior) of free cash flow, while Marathon had $12.27 billion (down 12.3%) and Phillips 66 recorded a disappointing $4.61 billion of free cash flow, roughly cut in half from the year prior (-46.5%). This demonstrates a lower capability for Phillips 66 to withstand oil price declines like the ones we witnessed in 2023.', 'Furthermore, while Valero and Marathon are better at generating free cash flows, they are also better at investing them. The returns on equity are significantly higher for both companies. When ROE is higher, it gives an indication that future free cash flow is likely to grow. Every dollar invested produces roughly $1.30 for Valero and Marathon, while for Phillips 66 is at $1.20 (which is still a healthy figure). Phillips 66 has a higher dividend yield; but the combination of lower free cash flows, lower ROE and higher dividend yield cause increased stress to the company relative to its competitors. Although the current ratio is comfortably above 1 (a current ratio below 1 means the company has a higher probability to go bankrupt as it does not have enough current assets to cover current liabilities), in my opinion both Valero and Marathon are significantly more attractive plays for a long-term investor wishing to gain exposure to the oil refining sector.', ""As with every investment, there are specific risks to be considered when gaining exposure to refining stocks. The main risk is the U.S. monetary policy and its implications on the economy. While most stocks would see their valuations benefit from interest rate cuts, which are likely to occur at the end of this year and next year (possibly after a recession hits the U.S. economy), oil refining stocks are not as sensitive to the rates. They are overall more sensitive to energy demand, so the possible recession that could trigger the interest rate cuts could cause the demand for oil-related products to fade and hence to negatively impact the oil refining companies' revenues. A second risk is that we are in an election year and energy is often at the center of heated political debates. Therefore, although valuations and financials are highly attractive, diversification is necessary when initiating a buy position at this point in time, despite the quality of the underlying businesses."", 'Oil refining stocks represent an attractive energy play because of their relative resistance to oil price declines and also thanks to their financial health. Amongst the oil refining stocks, the most interesting stocks to buy are Valero and Marathon Petroleum as they have better hard figures and multiyear performance in relation to Phillips 66. Given the potential recession and a U.S. election year, it is more interesting to own the stocks within a diversified portfolio. Oil refinining stocks are significantly undervalued in relation to big oil. However, the performance over the last couple of decades and cheap valuation may indicate that we are in the middle of a multiyear rally in this industry.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

With weaker-than-expected job growth per the April nonfarm payrolls report and moderating wage gains, investors are pricing in a second rate cut by the end of the year with a nearly 50% likelihood of a 25-basis point rate cut in September.Recent data from the nonfarm payrolls report showed job additions of 175,000 in April, well below the broader expectations of 240,000, with wage figures coming in less than expected. This allayed investor fears that the economy was “overheating” or “reaccelerating.” In addition, the Middle East ceasefire with Hamas accepting an Egyptian-Qatari proposal to end the war with Israel boosted the stocks. The equity markets were also aided by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments, which largely ruled out a central bank hike in its next policy meeting after holding the rates steady between 5.25% and 5.50% in May.However, a preliminary reading for the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index for May came in at 67.4, well below the broader expectations of 76, signifying that the war against inflation was far from over.

(SILV) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 17.8% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $8.75 in the previous session.

In its last earnings report on March 11, 2024, SilverCrest Metals reported EPS of $0.24 versus consensus estimate of $0.15."", 'For the current fiscal year, SilverCrest Metals is expected to post earnings of $0.54 per share on $256.25 million in revenues. This represents a -31.65% change in EPS on a 4.54% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $0.48 per share on $239.7 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -11.57% and -6.46%, respectively.', 'Valuation Metrics', 'SilverCrest Metals may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.', 'On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.', ""SilverCrest Metals has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A."", ""In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 15.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 18.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 9X versus its peer group's average of 7.9X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective."", 'Zacks Rank', 'We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, SilverCrest Metals currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.', 'Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if SilverCrest Metals passes the test. Thus, it seems as though SilverCrest Metals shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.', 'How Does SILV Stack Up to the Competition?', 'Shares of SILV have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Newmont Corporation (NEM). NEM has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of C, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of B.', 'Earnings were strong last quarter. Newmont Corporation beat our consensus estimate by 57.14%, and for the current fiscal year, NEM is expected to post earnings of $2.40 per share on revenue of $16.08 billion.', 'Shares of Newmont Corporation have gained 10% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 17.72X and a P/CF of 14.12X.', 'The Mining - Miscellaneous industry may rank in the bottom 67% of all the industries we have in our universe, but there still looks like there are some nice tailwinds for SILV and NEM, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The final reading of April was also revised downward to 77.2% from 77.9%, as reported earlier.', 'May’s preliminary reading marks a 12.7% decline in month over month. The primary reason for this decline was a sharp increase in consumers’ expectations for the inflation rate.', 'The outlook for one-year inflation expectation jumped to 3.5%, indicating a month-over-month rise of 0.3% and the highest level since November 2023. Similarly, the outlook for five-year inflation expectation climbed to 3.1%, suggesting a month-over-month rise of 0.1% and the highest level since November 2023.', 'The current conditions sub-index, which measures consumers’ thinking about their current financial situation, dropped to 68.8% in May from 78.8% in April. The expectation sub-index, which measures consumer’s expectations for the next six months, declined to 66.5% in May from 76% in April.', 'According to the survey’s director, Joanne Hsu, “While consumers had been reserving judgment for the past few months, they now perceive negative developments on a number of dimensions. They expressed worries that inflation, unemployment and interest rates may all be moving in an unfavorable direction in the year ahead.”', 'A significant drop in consumer sentiment is awful for the U.S. economy. Weak sentiment may result in a contraction in consumer spending going forward. However, consumer spending is the biggest driver of the U.S. economy constituting more than 2/3 of the GDP. Low consumer spending may lead to a recession.', 'On Apr 30, the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence deteriorated for the third consecutive month in April to 97%. The consensus estimate was 103.5%. The reading for March was also revised downward to 103.1% from 104.7% reported earlier.', 'The Present Situation Index — based on consumers’ assessment of current business and labor market conditions — declined to 142.9% in April from a downwardly revised 146.8% in March. The Expectations Index — based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions — fell to 66.4% from a slightly upwardly revised 74% last month. An Expectations Index reading below 80% often signals a forthcoming recession.', '“Confidence retreated further in April, reaching its lowest level since July 2022 as consumers became less positive about the current labor market situation, and more concerned about future business conditions, job availability, and income.”, said Dana M. Peterson, Chief Economist at The Conference Board.', 'At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in defensive stocks like consumer staples, utilities, and health care to safeguard one’s portfolio from volatile trading. We have narrowed our search to five such stocks with strong potential for the rest of 2024.', 'These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days.

When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

That cut short Intuitive Machines' full mission, although the NASA research equipment on board successfully sent back data from its experiments."", 'Intuitive Machines is now looking ahead to its second lunar mission, IM-2, which is scheduled for November.

Intuitive Machines has also developed a Lunar Data Network that enables communication and data relay services for spacecraft.', ""“As a company, our vision is to deliver space systems to the surface with our family of landers to do command and control and navigation in and around the moon so that it enables surface operations,” Altemus said. “I believe Intuitive Machines is the only company that's got all three pieces.”"", 'NASA estimates human activity in the region of space between the Earth and the moon will exceed all activity since 1957 in the next decade alone. That potential prompted the White House to develop its first science and technology strategy to “support responsible, peaceful, and sustainable exploration.”', 'The relative success of its first mission has provided a lift to Intuitive Machines. The company saw its cash balance increase to $54.6 million in the first three months of the year after an institutional investor exercised warrants.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the current defense spending trends in the continent, and head over directly to the 5 Weakest Militaries in Asia.', 'According to the latest figures released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), global military spending registered its steepest rise since 2009, increasing 6.8% from 2022 to total $2.44 trillion in 2023. This was the ninth successive year in which the world’s military spending had risen, with all major regions, including the Americas, Europe, and Asia witnessing an increase.', 'In 2023, $560 billion was spent on defense across Asia, increasing 3.6% year over year. Of this, $411 billion was incurred in East Asia, which represented 73% of the continent’s total defense spending. On the other hand, defense spending in South Asia was recorded at $98.2 billion, whereas $47.8 billion was expensed in Southeast Asia. The least expenditure in the continent was noticed in Central Asia, where only $1.8 billion was spent during the year.', 'Defense expenditure in Asia has risen by more than 40% since 2014, with a sharp rise being observed in East Asia and South Asia – the two major flashpoints of military and diplomatic escalation in the continent. Countries in the region have gotten embroiled in an arms race, and the resultant surge in demand for weapons has created a boom in the global armaments industry.', 'According to defense experts, the threat of China invading and annexing Taiwan is greater today than it ever was, with Beijing steadily stockpiling its arsenal for the last few decades. In response, the United States, in order to protect its own and Taipei’s interests, has ramped up its military presence in the Indo-Pacific region. Washington has also recently approved sales of weapons worth billions of dollars to Taiwan. In March last year, in a move that soured the relationship further between the United States and China, the American government approved selling new weapons worth $619 million to Taiwan, which included 200 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and 100 AGM-88B HARM missiles, among others. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) are the primary contractors of the deal.', ""The arms race between South Korea and North Korea also does not seem to have an end in sight any soon. Kim Jong-un’s regime has been a thorn in Seoul’s side, and has launched over a hundred ballistic missiles over the last two years, signaling Pyongyang's intentions of not relinquishing its weapons of mass destruction. South Korea in response increased its defense spending by 3.6% last year compared to 2022, incurring $47.9 billion in 2023, which included an order placed in September for 25 F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) valued at $5.06 billion. According to Yonhap News Agency, Seoul had already acquired another 40 F-35s from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) between 2019 and 2022."", 'The South China Sea continues to remain a point of contention between regional and global powers, with Beijing laying a claim over nearly all of its strategic waterways, while Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines have overlapping claims as well. South Asia also remains hot, as Pakistan and India continue to pile up their arsenals in what is termed as the most weaponized region in the world. The arch-rivals regularly launch newer, improved missiles, and showcase their latest military equipment in parade ceremonies and drills to flaunt their war capabilities to the other.', 'Countries in the Middle East have also been heavily upgrading their military capabilities to enhance national security, especially after the jolts faced by the Arab Spring in the early 2010s. Saudi Arabia has remained the fifth largest defense spender in the world for two successive years now – 2022 and 2023 – with over $75 billion incurred in military spending in each of these years, including a $3 billion agreement with the United States to purchase 300 MIM-104E Patriot missiles from RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX). There are also reports about RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) moving the production of parts involved in manufacturing the Patriot missiles to Saudi Arabia.', 'All said and done, while defense spending continues to expand significantly in Asia, the increase has not been even within the continent, as was evident from the breakdown of military spending in Asia shared earlier in the discussion. There are regions and countries in the continent where defense expenditure, sizes and inventories of militaries remain small, because of which, these are some of the weakest militaries in Asia.', 'We now take a look at these countries.

With weaker-than-expected job growth per the April nonfarm payrolls report and moderating wage gains, investors are pricing in a second rate cut by the end of the year with a nearly 50% likelihood of a 25-basis point rate cut in September.Recent data from the nonfarm payrolls report showed job additions of 175,000 in April, well below the broader expectations of 240,000, with wage figures coming in less than expected. This allayed investor fears that the economy was “overheating” or “reaccelerating.” In addition, the Middle East ceasefire with Hamas accepting an Egyptian-Qatari proposal to end the war with Israel boosted the stocks. The equity markets were also aided by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments, which largely ruled out a central bank hike in its next policy meeting after holding the rates steady between 5.25% and 5.50% in May.However, a preliminary reading for the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index for May came in at 67.4, well below the broader expectations of 76, signifying that the war against inflation was far from over. This, in turn, is likely to fuel skepticism as investors await further cues with April’s consumer price index reading slated for release this week. \xa0As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Iron Mountain Incorporated IRM, Suzano S.A. SUZ, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM, The TJX Companies, Inc.

In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.', ""In order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture.

That’s where dividend stocks come in. These equities accounted for an average of 34% of the market’s total returns from 1940 to 2023 and made significant contributions during decades of high inflation. This shows that building wealth through dividends takes time and patience, so one shouldn’t expect a bountiful harvest overnight.', 'A clear example of the power of dividends can be observed through Warren Buffett’s investment in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).

In 2023, the dividend amount received by Berkshire had skyrocketed to a staggering $736 million, and it is set to receive $776 million in Coke dividends this year. This highlights the compounding effect of dividends and solid returns they can deliver to long-term investors like Buffett. In addition to compounding benefits, it is worth mentioning that the company has consistently increased its dividends for over six decades. That is why financial experts always advise investing in dividend-growth stocks for long-term gains.', 'Kirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist in the Chief Investment Office for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, spoke about the importance of dividend growth stocks in the firm’s annual report. Here is what she said:', '“Generally, it’s larger, more mature companies that return capital to their shareholders in the form of dividends. Companies that have consistently increased their dividends tend to be more stable, higher-quality businesses, which historically have weathered downturns and are more likely to have the ability to pay dividends consistently.”', 'That said, maintaining dividend growth over time demands financial stability and unwavering commitment. Dividend growth stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 due to their potential for capital appreciation and financial health. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, delivered a 10.68% return to shareholders since its inception in 2005 through 2023, as we reported in our article, 14 Dividend Growth Stocks with Highest Growth Rates, citing data from ProShares.

In 2023, the dividend amount received by Berkshire had skyrocketed to a staggering $736 million, and it is set to receive $776 million in Coke dividends this year. This highlights the compounding effect of dividends and solid returns they can deliver to long-term investors like Buffett. In addition to compounding benefits, it is worth mentioning that the company has consistently increased its dividends for over six decades. That is why financial experts always advise investing in dividend-growth stocks for long-term gains.', 'Kirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist in the Chief Investment Office for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, spoke about the importance of dividend growth stocks in the firm’s annual report. Here is what she said:', '“Generally, it’s larger, more mature companies that return capital to their shareholders in the form of dividends. Companies that have consistently increased their dividends tend to be more stable, higher-quality businesses, which historically have weathered downturns and are more likely to have the ability to pay dividends consistently.”', 'That said, maintaining dividend growth over time demands financial stability and unwavering commitment. Dividend growth stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 due to their potential for capital appreciation and financial health. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, delivered a 10.68% return to shareholders since its inception in 2005 through 2023, as we reported in our article, 14 Dividend Growth Stocks with Highest Growth Rates, citing data from ProShares. During this period, the broader market underperformed the dividend aristocrats and returned 10.05%. We also reported that dividend aristocrats achieved these returns with a lower volatility of 15.30%, compared with a 16.24% volatility of the benchmark.', 'Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are some of the best dividend stocks for long-term investments as these companies have raised their payouts for decades, which shows their sound financial position.

For this industrial equipment and software maker, possessing an expansive global footprint, parsing the trends of international revenues could be critical to gauge its financial resilience and growth prospects.', ""In the current global economy, which is more interconnected than ever, a company's success in penetrating international markets is crucial for its financial health and growth journey. Investors must understand a company's dependence on overseas markets, as this offers a window into the company's earnings stability, its ability to benefit from varied economic cycles and its potential for long-term growth."", 'International market involvement serves as insurance against economic downturns at home and enables engagement with economies that are growing more quickly. Still, this move toward diversification is not without its challenges, as it involves navigating through the fluctuations of currencies, geopolitical threats, and the distinctive nature of various markets.', ""In our recent assessment of ROK's quarterly performance, we discovered notable trends in its overseas revenue sections, which are typically modeled and scrutinized by Wall Street analysts."", ""For the quarter, the company's total revenue amounted to $2.13 billion, experiencing a decline of 6.6% year over year. Next, we'll explore the breakdown of ROK's international revenue to understand the importance of its overseas business operations."", ""A Dive into ROK's International Revenue Trends"", 'During the quarter, Asia Pacific contributed $269.9 million in revenue, making up 12.7% of the total revenue.

This represented a surprise of -19.48% compared to the $495.38 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, EMEA accounted for $388.3 million (18.9%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $486.5 million (21.4%) to the total revenue.', ""Latin America accounted for 7.7% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $163.6 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of +268.94%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $-96.84 million.

Today, Southwest Airlines stock trades 58% below all-time highs, valuing the company at a market cap of $16 billion. However, I don’t believe Southwest Airlines stock is a good buy at its current valuation. I am bearish on Southwest Airlines due to its exposure to Boeing (NYSE:BA), narrowing earnings, and high balance sheet debt.', 'In early 2020, governments all around the world were forced to shut their borders to limit the spread of the dreaded virus. To remain operational, airline companies increased balance sheet debt while revenue and cash flows fell significantly.', 'While global travel resumed by late 2021, central banks hiked interest rates to offset inflation, both of which touched multi-year highs in 2022. The triple whammy of high debt, interest rates, and inflation has impacted the profitability of Southwest Airlines and its peers, even though travel demand staged a remarkable comeback in a post-pandemic world.', 'Southwest Airlines is among the largest airline companies in the world. It operates and manages a fleet of passenger aircraft. Moreover, it offers ancillary services such as early bird check-in, upgraded boarding, and transportation of pets and unaccompanied minors.', 'The ongoing pullback has meant that LUV stock has returned just 19% to shareholders in the past decade (see below), trailing the S&P 500 Index (SPX), which has more than tripled investor returns after adjusting for dividends.', 'Southwest operates an all-Boeing fleet and relies heavily on the aircraft manufacturers’ line of 737 planes. However, the 737 aircraft have wrestled with a range of issues in the last five years. For instance, several countries grounded 737 Max 8 jets in 2019 and 2020 after two fatal crashes were reported in a span of six months, raising concerns over the safety of these jets.', 'Earlier this year, Boeing came under fire again after an Alaska Airlines flight (a Boeing 737 Max 9) landed 10 minutes after takeoff because a window panel blew out.', 'In fact, over a dozen equipment problems involving Boeing have been reported since 2012 as it continues to lose market share to Airbus.', 'Now, Boeing is wrestling with production delays and pressure from regulators, which is hurting companies such as Southwest Airlines.', 'Last month, Southwest Airlines announced its Q1 results for 2024, reporting a wider-than-expected loss, and warned that airplane delays from Boeing would hamper near-term growth. Southwest Airlines reported revenue of $6.33 billion and a loss of $0.36 per share. Comparatively, analysts forecast Q1 revenue at $6.42 billion and a loss of $0.34 per share.', 'The airline expects to grow its capacity by 4% in 2024, lower than its previous guidance of 6%. It also estimates revenue to decline by 3.5% year-over-year in Q2 of 2024.', 'Southwest Airlines emphasized that it now expects to receive 20 737 Max 8 planes from Boeing, much lower than its previous forecast of 46 planes. So, Southwest will have to delay retiring older jets as it also looks to reduce costs amid a challenging operating environment.', 'Additionally, Southwest Airlines announced it would shut down operations at airports such as Houston’s George Bush International and New York’s Syracuse. The airline carrier is also scaling back operations in Atlanta and Chicago.', 'In its earnings release, Southwest CEO Bob Jordan explained, “The recent news from Boeing regarding further aircraft delivery delays presents significant challenges for both 2024 and 2025. We are reacting and replanning quickly to mitigate the operational and financial impacts while maintaining dependable flight schedules for our customers.”', 'Southwest Airlines stated that it has re-planned its capacity for the next two years due to Boeing’s delivery delays. However, it warned investors and explained that there is no assurance that Boeing will meet its most recent delivery schedule.', 'Southwest Airlines ended Q1 with $8 billion in total outstanding debt and $11.5 billion in liquidity. Southwest must generate enough cash flow to service its debt and make regular interest payments. However, the company reported a free cash outflow of almost $700 million in Q1, making investors nervous.', 'A negative free cash flow figure limits Southwest Airlines’ ability to reinvest in growth or lower balance sheet debt. If Southwest Airlines continues to report negative free cash flow, it would reduce total liquidity levels and drive its valuation lower.', 'Out of the 14 analyst ratings given to LUV stock, five are Buys, nine are Holds, and one is a Sell, indicating a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average LUV stock price target\xa0is $30.59, indicating upside potential of 9.3% from current levels.', 'Nonetheless, LUV stock is forecast to end 2024 with adjusted earnings of $1.16 per share, indicating a forward earnings multiple of 23.7x, higher than the sector median of 19x.', 'Prior to the pandemic, Southwest was one of the best growth stocks in the airline sector. While it remains a well-run business, its exposure to Boeing and other macro headwinds makes it a high-risk investment right now.', 'Investors looking to gain exposure might want to consider other companies instead of buying LUV stock on the dip.', 'Disclosure']"

Higher interest rates have weighed on real estate values to increase their income yields above those of lower-risk income investments like bonds. In addition, higher rates have made it more expensive for REITs to borrow money to fund development projects and acquisitions. ', ""However, rates likely won't stay this high for much longer. The Federal Reserve plans to begin cutting them as soon as inflation is under control, which it hopes will be the case before the end of the year. As a result, now looks like a smart time to buy REITs. While many look attractive, Realty Income (NYSE: O), Prologis (NYSE: PLD), and Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE: MAA) stand out as some of the top options. They could turn a $1,000 investment into a lucrative income stream while also potentially delivering strong share-price gains. "", ""Realty Income built a real estate business designed to deliver dependable dividend income. It pays a monthly dividend that has steadily grown over the decades. It most recently delivered its 124th increase since its public market listing in 1994 (and 106th consecutive quarterly increase). Realty Income's dividend yields an attractive 5.6% at its recent share price. It could turn a $1,000 investment into $56 of annual dividend income at that rate. "", 'Elevated interest rates are currently a headwind for the company. Its share price sits about 25% below its high before the Fed started raising rates, which is a big reason why it has such a lofty yield. That has made it less attractive to issue new stock to fund acquisitions. Meanwhile, debt is more expensive. As a result, Realty Income only plans to invest about $2 billion to acquire real estate this year, which is well below its roughly $9 billion annual run rate in recent years. ', ""However, as rates fall, Realty Income's stock price should rise, enabling it to use shares as a currency to fund more deals. That would boost its growth and enhance its ability to continue increasing its dividend. The company's combination of income yield, earnings growth, and price appreciation potential positions it to produce strong total returns in the coming years. "", 'Prologis highlighted the impact rates are having on its business in its first-quarter earnings release. CEO Hamid Moghadam noted: ""While operating conditions are healthy in the majority of our markets, customers remain focused on controlling costs, which is weighing on decision making and the pace of leasing. A volatile and persistently high interest rate environment, together with mounting geopolitical concerns, contribute to this indecision and its short-term effect on net absorption."" That issue led the REIT to tweak its guidance, reducing its expectations for occupancy, same-store net operating income (NOI), and funds from operations (FFO). ', 'However, the CEO also stated, ""We remain optimistic about the fundamentals of our business."" Management believes things will be slower in the next quarter or two before reaccelerating due to the strong tailwinds driving the industrial real estate sector, including a favorable outlook on new supply. That drives Prologis\' belief its core FFO will increase by an average of 9% to 11% annually through 2026. ', 'That strong growth rate should enable Prologis to continue boosting its dividend at an above-average pace. With its dividend yield up to 3.6% -- due to a rising payout and lower stock price -- and robust growth ahead, Prologis could generate strong total returns as rates begin to ease. ', 'Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is battling interest rate and supply headwinds. Those issues weighed on its first-quarter results. Its same-store NOI dipped 0.7% in the period due to rising expenses and very modest rent growth. ', 'However, better days lie ahead, especially on the supply side. ""With continued solid demand and the resulting steady absorption of the new supply pipeline, we continue to believe that the decline in new supply deliveries expected late this year and into 2025 will fuel a strong and quick rebound in rent performance,"" CEO Eric Bolton stated in the first-quarter earnings release. Add in the likely easing of expense headwinds as inflation and rates fall, and the REIT could deliver stronger FFO-per-share growth in the future. ', 'Another growth catalyst is its investment program. MAA had five new communities under development at the end of the first quarter, which it expects to complete over the next two years. Meanwhile, it has a strong balance sheet, giving it plenty of flexibility to capture new growth opportunities. Add in its growth, share price upside as market conditions rebound, and attractive dividend (4.3% yield), and MAA could deliver robust total returns in the coming years. ', 'Falling rates have weighed on REIT stock prices, making their dividends more attractive. However, those high yields might not last much longer given that the Fed appears poised to start lowering rates. Because of that, high-quality REITs like Realty Income, Prologis, and MAA look like really smart investments right now.

It has emerged as a key process for retailers to improve operational efficiency, reduce costly mistakes and empower employees.', 'Applications include mobile point of sales, clienteling [a technique used by retail sales associates to establish long-term relationships with key customers based on data about their preferences] or self-scanning devices for customer purchases.', ""One of Scandit's tools, which utilises augmented reality (AR) overlays [digital data that overlays the real-world environment shown through the phone's camera], enables store associates to instantly view stock levels, delivery dates, price validation and expiry dates by pointing their smartphone cameras at shelves. The tool can also be used by consumer-facing apps to give shoppers more info about the items in front of them."", 'Grisolia gives an example of her visit to a UK retailer’s stockroom where she asked an employee how they knew which barcodes to scan for stocktaking. Data capture within retail operations traditionally consisted of this type of repetitive task, which has been most apparent in the grocery and fashion segments.', '“He said he just scans one barcode,"" Grisolia explains, ""and if the device makes a noise, his job is done. A lot of these one-way processes rely on a timed activity where you get data, but you don\'t get information out of it or what you should do after interacting with the data.”', 'Smart data capture can provide information that an associate can then act upon. It can scan entire walls of items for identification through AR overlays and be personalised for different workflows.', 'Grisolia uses the apparel company VF Corporation to demonstrate the point. “A few years ago [VF] had to cancel around 15% of its online orders because its previous scanning process didn’t identify what items were in-store. So, the retailer was accepting orders online, and when the employees were going to collect the items, they were not there. This process has since improved.”', 'Smart data capture avoids these issues and creates error-free workflows by improving inventory visibility. Retail workers can scan to see what items are in stock in their store or even nearby stores.', 'This is the same no matter the size of the retailer, but integration paths can differ depending on whether the company has native applications or a web application.', 'As for overall benefits, Grisolia confirms that “efficiency is a definite outcome alongside the overall satisfaction of the associates as they can feel more empowered in their work, which will in turn benefit consumers.”', 'Scandit has surveyed global frontline retail workers to reveal their views on technology in the industry.', '“A key pain point was that 41% of respondents felt that they were not equipped with the right technology to do their job. So, we need to double down on these solutions,” states Grisolia.', 'Additionally, the research found that more than two-thirds of store associates rate their devices as important or very important for their job. Across all ages, the ability to multi-task (70%), access to product information (67%) and device intuitiveness (52%) are crucial capabilities in smartphone and scanning devices.', 'Reducing confusion with smart data capture means a less stressful environment for workers, particularly in segments that deal with high-value goods that are at risk of being lost or misallocated with traditional stocktaking methods.', 'Scandit is focusing on user experience to provide intuitive technology for retail workers, which will have broader impacts on work/life balance.', 'Scandit CEO and cofounder Samuel Mueller comments: “Increased consumer pressure, operational efficiency requirements, ongoing labour shortages and the advent of AI have required retailers to rethink how they attract, retain and motivate store associates.”', 'With dedicated training, interactive technology can become key to employee engagement and loyalty, but Grisolia emphasises that this will only drive change “if retailers ensure that the human component of being close to the customer remains the most valuable and impactful part.”', 'In terms of the retail industry’s uptake of smart data capture, Grisolia highlights sporting goods, luxury retailers and consumer electronics segments as areas of acceleration.', 'Rather than instigating widespread replacement, this solution demonstrates a symbiosis between humans and technology that can have tangibly positive effects on workforce productivity and engagement.', '""Scandit on the smart data revolution in retail"" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.', '', '\xa0', 'The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

All that changed when her father, a farmer and a church deacon, was shot by a white farmer and died later that week. Sherrod was 17 at the time, about to graduate from high school.', '""The thought occurred to me then, as I prayed and asked for help, that I could give up my dream of living my life in the North,"" Sherrod said. ""I could stay in the South and devote my life to working for change.""', ""Shirley Sherrod, 76, has spent the past half-century working for change. With her husband Charles Sherrod, a well-known civil rights leader, in 1969 she co-founded New Communities, Inc., the country's first collective land trust, creating a safe haven and a position of power for Black farmers removed from their land. When the organization lost its land to foreclosure in the 1980s, Sherrod went to work for the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, where she was tasked with helping Black farmers keep their land."", ""The Sherrods devoted their lives to advancing voting rights, solidarity, and wealth building through land ownership. But for a new generation of housing leaders like Devin Culbertson, their story is much more than a history lesson. It's an urgent call to action."", '""Movements must evolve and adapt to the current landscape and challenges. And the foundation of the Sherrods\' land ownership model remains more relevant than ever,"" said Culbertson, vice president of innovative finance at Grounded Solutions Network.', ""The legacy of the Sherrods' work has spread far beyond the farmlands of southern Georgia, with the community land trust model gaining traction across the country, even in urban areas."", 'Together with his team at Grounded Solutions Network, Culbertson is building on that model with the support of a $3 million grant from the Housing Affordability Breakthrough Challenge led by Enterprise and the Wells Fargo Foundation. Their winning financing innovation, the Homes for the Future Fund, aims to promote homeownership and upward mobility in Black and brown communities, while keeping homes affordable in perpetuity. Culbertson likens the grant to venture capital, critical support that offers bold leaders flexible resources and a network of expertise to advance their solutions.', 'Culbertson recently spoke with Shirley Sherrod about the power and potential of the community land trust movement. Here are excerpts from their conversation.', 'Devon Culbertson: New Communities Inc. - the organization you founded in 1969 - is the starting place for the community land trust movement. What made you feel this was the right work to focus on?', 'Shirley Sherrod: Our work started with the Civil Rights Movement and organizing here in rural southwest Georgia. As we were helping people to exercise their rights, they would get kicked off the land owned by white people. ""Our goal was to try to acquire land so that we would never lose it. And that\'s why we chose the community land trust model so that we would all own it together. No one person could mortgage anything so that we could lose it.""', ""We were really trying to look at how to get this land and hold it forever, for everyone's use."", 'DC: What has kept you focused on this movement over the years, given the headwinds you have faced? What has kept you there on a personal level?', ""SS: I did not intend to live my life on the farm, and I didn't intend to live my life in the South. Everything changed in one night - the night my father was murdered by a white farmer, who was not prosecuted, even though there were witnesses. I'm the oldest of six children and I was 17 and a senior in high school on that night. My mother was pregnant with my brother."", 'As the oldest, I needed to come up with a plan. I had no idea what I would do then - it unfolded through the years; initially, it was trying to integrate schools. Then it was trying to get the right to vote.', ""At a certain point, we were also looking at how the local county committee would target Black landowners. If they were trying to borrow money or get access to programs through USDA, they would be denied. The land was targeted, and Black landowners would end up losing it. Around 1910, Black farmers owned over 15 million acres and we're down to less than 2 million acres now."", 'Through the years, marrying Charles Sherrod and getting deeply involved in the civil rights work and working with farmers, we realized that the only way to hold on to land was to own it together.', 'DC: Land meant so many things then and it means different things now - stability for families, source of political agency, the ability to vote, and economic opportunity. What did land mean to you and why did holding that land become so powerful?', ""SS: Land was a path to independence - as much as we could, as Black people, have independence in the Jim Crow era. Land meant having a path to getting an education. We have doctors and lawyers and so forth, because that base of land was purchased. And many of them didn't stay on the farm - I didn't intend to stay there either."", ""At New Communities we didn't just work on acquiring land. We also made the decision that we would not operate in the normal way of a big boss and everybody working under that. We decided we would have committees - for example, there was a farm committee, there was also an education committee, a health committee, and an industry committee."", 'We looked to the land to help move us forward as we worked together. But we had that added layer of racism and discrimination to deal with. And that ultimately caused the failure of our project.', 'DC: That really resonates. We see situations where people go through foreclosure and become renters in their own homes. How do we use our understanding of how the deck can be stacked against us to better serve people?', ""SS: I've worked with farmers for years and had to convince them in the earlier years, it's no longer possible for you to work your farm without working with other farmers and forming cooperatives. At one point I helped a group of farmers learn how to raise seedless watermelons. The markets in the area were not open to us. So we connected with a group in Boston and we were shipping seedless watermelons from Georgia to Boston. People had to understand it's no longer possible for them to be on that little plot of land and not interact and work with other farmers."", 'DC: What do you see as lessons for creating broader economic benefit through this type of cooperation and solidarity?', ""SS: When people come together, truly committed to working with each other, the sky is the limit in terms of ideas and things they can do together to create their own jobs and income stream. A good example for us was in the 1990s, when Ben and Jerry's wanted to do something to help with Black land loss. They said they would buy product from Black farmers to go in their ice cream. So, I organized farmers into a co-op that we called Southern Alternatives. We faced a lot of opposition because it was hard to find a white-owned sheller who would process our pecans for us. And in the end, Ben and Jerry's had to strong arm their major supplier to get them to do it."", ""When you are working together and people see you working together, opportunities surface.

That's a potentially incredible opportunity for risk-tolerant investors."", 'The weight-loss drug market could reach a staggering $158 billion in sales by 2032, per Leerink Partners. For a non-COVID product, the pharmaceutical industry has never witnessed such a massive commercial opportunity.', ""Breaking this down further, VK2735 might be a $30 billion-a-year drug in the making, depending on how the competitive landscape shapes up, the drug's pivotal-stage data, and the trajectory of the out-of-control obesity epidemic."", ""After all, these next-generation weight loss drugs aren't only showing dramatic improvements in lipid profiles; they are exhibiting clear-cut cardiovascular and blood sugar control benefits as well."", ""Why should investors take notice? With only a 3x handle, Viking could warrant a $90 billion market capitalization. It currently garners a market cap of just $8.12 billion.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 High-Paying Entry-Level Jobs in the US.', 'Entry-level jobs, traditionally seen as roles that require minimal prior experience or skills, now appear to demand a laundry list of qualifications. From requiring years of experience to demanding mastery of various skills like graphic design, SEO, and copywriting, the expectations can feel overwhelming. Even advanced degrees are listed as preferred qualifications for entry-level positions which adds to the frustration.', 'This frustration is not unfounded. Studies have shown that 42% of job seekers feel excluded from opportunities due to a lack of formal qualifications or experience. In fact, nearly half of employees report feeling this way, according to a 2023 report. Another barrier cited is the lack of relevant skills or credentials, as highlighted by a 2022 report. The emphasis on skills-based hiring has become more pronounced as employers prioritize experience and abilities over degrees.', ""However, there's a shift in hiring trends as fewer human resources leaders are focusing on entry-level positions compared to previous years. This trend suggests a growing preference for experienced candidates over those just starting their careers. One explanation for this could be the gap in skills and training, with employers increasingly seeking external hires rather than investing in internal talent development."", 'Speaking of the skill-gap, it is concerning to note that the manufacturing industry in the United States is observing a skills gap that could result in 2.1 million unfilled jobs by 2030, according to a study by Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute. The projected cost of these vacancies would amount to $1 trillion by the end of the decade.', ""Moreover, despite the industry's efforts to rebound from the pandemic-induced setbacks, the shortage of skilled labor persists. Although 63% of the jobs lost during the pandemic have been recovered, approximately 570,000 positions remained unfulfilled as of the end of 2020. Manufacturers are struggling with a 36% increase in the difficulty of finding a suitable workforce."", 'Beyond the manufacturing industry, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) is stepping up to address the increasing skills gap in artificial intelligence (AI) by committing to training 2 million individuals over the next three years.

What sets SkillsBuild apart is its customization and translation across multiple languages.', 'Moreover, by partnering with historically Black colleges and universities to establish cybersecurity leadership centers and expanding training opportunities for teachers globally, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) aims to ensure inclusivity and diversity in AI education. Additionally, by eliminating four-year degree requirements for half of its US jobs, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) exemplifies a ""skills-first agenda”.', 'Apart from hard skills, companies like Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) tend to equally focus on softer skills as well. For example, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)’s\xa0 training program for store managers has a focus on compassionate leadership and effective communication. Each year, approximately 2,000 managers participate in the Manager Academy at Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas.

Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“In our view, it is unlikely that what has worked for the last year and a half will be what continues to work. \xa0We think now is a good time for investors to look for contrarian investment opportunities, especially in those areas that have underperformed, are unloved—and most importantly—undervalued.”', 'Undervalued stocks are those that are trading below their intrinsic value. This means that the market price of these stocks does not truly reflect their worth. Investing in undervalued dividend stocks can be a good opportunity for investors as these equities provide a steady income stream even if the stock price doesn’t immediately appreciate. In addition to this, value stocks have shown strong performance over growth stocks over time. Studies conducted by Josef Lakonishok, a former finance professor at the University of Illinois, and David Dreman, a renowned expert in value investing, have highlighted that value stocks typically offer higher dividend yields and exhibit stronger fundamental ratios compared to high-flying growth stocks, as we reported in our article 30 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts.

On May 10, the University of Michigan reported that the preliminary index of consumer sentiment tumbled to a reading of 67.4%. The consensus estimate was 76%. The final reading of April was also revised downward to 77.2% from 77.9%, as reported earlier.', 'May’s preliminary reading marks a 12.7% decline in month over month. The primary reason for this decline was a sharp increase in consumers’ expectations for the inflation rate.', 'The outlook for one-year inflation expectation jumped to 3.5%, indicating a month-over-month rise of 0.3% and the highest level since November 2023. Similarly, the outlook for five-year inflation expectation climbed to 3.1%, suggesting a month-over-month rise of 0.1% and the highest level since November 2023.', 'The current conditions sub-index, which measures consumers’ thinking about their current financial situation, dropped to 68.8% in May from 78.8% in April. The expectation sub-index, which measures consumer’s expectations for the next six months, declined to 66.5% in May from 76% in April.', 'According to the survey’s director, Joanne Hsu, “While consumers had been reserving judgment for the past few months, they now perceive negative developments on a number of dimensions. They expressed worries that inflation, unemployment and interest rates may all be moving in an unfavorable direction in the year ahead.”', 'A significant drop in consumer sentiment is awful for the U.S. economy. Weak sentiment may result in a contraction in consumer spending going forward. However, consumer spending is the biggest driver of the U.S. economy constituting more than 2/3 of the GDP. Low consumer spending may lead to a recession.', 'On Apr 30, the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence deteriorated for the third consecutive month in April to 97%. The consensus estimate was 103.5%. The reading for March was also revised downward to 103.1% from 104.7% reported earlier.', 'The Present Situation Index — based on consumers’ assessment of current business and labor market conditions — declined to 142.9% in April from a downwardly revised 146.8% in March. The Expectations Index — based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions — fell to 66.4% from a slightly upwardly revised 74% last month.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their previous performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'For long-term investing, many investors aim for not just growth but a steady stream of income to keep their financial ship sailing smoothly. That’s where dividend stocks come in. These equities accounted for an average of 34% of the market’s total returns from 1940 to 2023 and made significant contributions during decades of high inflation. This shows that building wealth through dividends takes time and patience, so one shouldn’t expect a bountiful harvest overnight.', 'A clear example of the power of dividends can be observed through Warren Buffett’s investment in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Berkshire Hathaway acquired KO shares for $1.3 billion back in 1994 and received $75 million in cash dividends through this investment. In 2023, the dividend amount received by Berkshire had skyrocketed to a staggering $736 million, and it is set to receive $776 million in Coke dividends this year. This highlights the compounding effect of dividends and solid returns they can deliver to long-term investors like Buffett. In addition to compounding benefits, it is worth mentioning that the company has consistently increased its dividends for over six decades. That is why financial experts always advise investing in dividend-growth stocks for long-term gains.', 'Kirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist in the Chief Investment Office for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, spoke about the importance of dividend growth stocks in the firm’s annual report. Here is what she said:', '“Generally, it’s larger, more mature companies that return capital to their shareholders in the form of dividends. Companies that have consistently increased their dividends tend to be more stable, higher-quality businesses, which historically have weathered downturns and are more likely to have the ability to pay dividends consistently.”', 'That said, maintaining dividend growth over time demands financial stability and unwavering commitment. Dividend growth stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 due to their potential for capital appreciation and financial health. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, delivered a 10.68% return to shareholders since its inception in 2005 through 2023, as we reported in our article, 14 Dividend Growth Stocks with Highest Growth Rates, citing data from ProShares. During this period, the broader market underperformed the dividend aristocrats and returned 10.05%. We also reported that dividend aristocrats achieved these returns with a lower volatility of 15.30%, compared with a 16.24% volatility of the benchmark.', 'Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are some of the best dividend stocks for long-term investments as these companies have raised their payouts for decades, which shows their sound financial position. In this article, we will further take a look at some of the best long-term dividend stocks to invest in.', 'Photo by Dan Dennis on Unsplash', 'Our Methodology:', 'To compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources such as Forbes, Morningstar, Barron’s, CNBC, Times, and Business Insider. We aimed to identify the top long-term dividend stocks recommended by financial media, analysts, and experts. From our research, we picked 14 dividend stocks which are the mot popular in the financial media these days.\xa0These stocks have strong dividend histories and are financially sound, indicating their ability to sustain dividend payments well into the future. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds as of Q4 2023.

But since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, other next-big-thing trends have consistently come up short. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) aims to change that.', 'In its simplest form, AI relies on software and systems to handle tasks that humans would normally oversee. What gives AI its undeniably lofty ceiling is the ability for these systems to learn and evolve without human intervention over time. Being able to infiltrate almost every sector and industry of the global economy can lead to trillions of dollars in added consumption-side benefits and productivity gains by the end of the decade.', ""Although semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the most direct beneficiary of the artificial intelligence revolution, it hasn't necessarily been a favorite of Wall Street's brightest and most-successful investors. Based on Form 13Fs filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that cover trades made during the fourth quarter, billionaire investors were sellers of Nvidia and chose to pile into two fast-growing AI stocks instead."", ""Based solely on Nvidia's headline growth figures, investors would struggle to find any flaws with the company. Sales more than doubled in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024), with Data Center segment revenue skyrocketing by 217%."", ""Initial demand for Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) has been otherworldly, which has resulted in exceptional pricing power for these chips. It's been estimated that Nvidia's GPUs, which are the preferred choice for running generative AI solutions and training large language models, control around a 90% share in high-compute data centers."", ""However, this didn't stop more than a half-dozen billionaire asset managers from paring down their fund's respective stakes in Nvidia during the December-ended quarter (total shares sold in parenthesis):"", 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares)', 'Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares)', 'Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares)', 'David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares)', 'Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares)', 'Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares)', 'David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)', ""Following an almost parabolic run higher by Nvidia's stock, these eight prominent billionaires may be counting on history rhyming, once more. Every next-big-thing investment trend or innovation since the mid-1990s has undergone a bubble-bursting event in its early stages of adoption. This is to say that investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the uptake of new technology. It's unlikely that AI breaks this streak, which would leave Nvidia's stock highly vulnerable to downside."", 'It\'s also hard to ignore the competitive pressures the company is liable to face in the coming months. Aside from direct external competition from the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia has to cope with the fact that most of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies are developing in-house GPUs for their data centers. That\'s a problem when 40% of Nvidia\'s net sales come from four members of the Magnificent Seven.', ""Regulators have put a glass ceiling above Nvidia, as well. Despite its attempts to develop toned-down AI-GPUs for China, U.S. regulators have blocked exports of Nvidia's high-powered GPUs to the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product on two separate occasions."", 'While billionaires were busy showing Nvidia to the door, they were piling into two other rapidly growing AI stocks.', ""The first high-growth artificial intelligence stock that billionaires couldn't stop buying as they were sending shares of Nvidia to the chopping block is robotic-assisted surgical system developer Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG). During the fourth quarter, a half-dozen billionaires took the plunge, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):"", 'Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (516,054 shares)', 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management (327,505 shares)', 'Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (301,908 shares)', 'Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (290,501 shares)', 'Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (90,072 shares)', 'Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (82,975 shares)', ""Intuitive Surgical is best-known for its multiple generations of da Vinci surgical systems, which assist surgeons with a variety of soft tissue procedures. The company's systems are designed to reduce hospital recovery times and minimize the likelihood of post-procedure complications. The incorporation of AI and machine learning should improve patient care and lead to more informed decision-making."", ""This is a company that's undeniably enjoying first-mover competitive advantages. Through the end of March, it had nearly 8,900 of its da Vinci systems installed worldwide, which is far more robotic-assisted surgical systems than any of its competitors. Since these systems are pricey, and it takes quite a bit of time to train surgeons to use them, the company tends to keep its customers for a long time."", ""Another reason Intuitive Surgical has been such a phenomenal investment for so long is its razor-and-blades operating model. Although its da Vinci systems are pricey (often $0.5 million to $2.5 million), they're intricate and costly to build. Where the company generates its juiciest margins is from selling instruments with each procedure, as well as servicing these systems. These higher-margin categories have grown into a larger percentage of total sales over time, allowing earnings per share (EPS) to increase at a faster pace than its sales."", ""I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that the company's robotic-assisted surgical systems are still just scratching the surface with regard to their potential. While there are a few soft tissue indications where the da Vinci system dominates, there's a long runway to gain share in general soft tissue and thoracic procedures."", 'The second rapidly growing artificial intelligence stock billionaires have been piling into as they sell shares of semiconductor titan Nvidia is social media maven Pinterest (NYSE: PINS). Four top-tier billionaire money managers were buyers of Pinterest stock during the fourth quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):', 'David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (6,823,828 shares)', 'Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (317,658 shares)', 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management (98,282 shares)', ""Pinterest has been leaning on AI and machine learning tools for years to improve the search functionality on its site and ensure that users are being shown content that's going to keep them engaged. In theory, further investment in AI should help Pinterest funnel users directly to merchants that carry well-liked/in-demand items."", ""For the March-ended quarter, Pinterest's stand-out number was its monthly active user (MAU) growth. While user growth isn't everything, it marked the first time Pinterest surpassed the half-billion MAU mark. This suggests the platform is resonating with a growing percentage of the global population."", ""Having 518 million MAUs has its perks on the advertising side, too.

ISRG is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strength in robotics. The optimism, led by the solid 2023 results and its progress on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) front, is expected to contribute further. However, procedure adoption risks and stiff competition persist.', 'Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 14.6% so far this year compared with the industry’s 7.3% growth. The S&P 500 Index has gained 9.7% during the same time frame.', 'Intuitive Surgical, the pioneer of robotic-assisted surgery and a renowned provider of minimally invasive care, has a market capitalization of $137.16 billion. It projects 16.1% growth over the next five years.', 'The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 6.78%.', '\xa0', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', '\xa0', 'Let’s delve deeper.', 'Strength in Robotics: We are upbeat about Intuitive Surgical’s robot-based da Vinci surgical system that enables minimally invasive surgery and reduces the trauma associated with open surgery. The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology that has provided the company with solid exposure to medical mechatronics, robotics and AI for the healthcare space. The company gained FDA clearance for its da Vinci 5 fifth-generation multiport robotic system earlier this month. The system is believed to be the smoothest and the most accurate device in ISRG’s portfolio.', 'On the first-quarter 2024 earnings call, the company stated that its installed base of the da Vinci system grew approximately 14% year over year. The utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, was up 2% from the prior-year quarter’s level.', 'Progress on the AI Front: We are also positive about the growing adoption of minimally invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, the use of information technology for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model. These developments indicate the high prevalence of AI in the MedTech space.', 'Per management, the rise of medical mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging has enabled new solutions to old problems. AI has been enhancing Intuitive Surgical’s product portfolio with clinical applications, diagnostic support, operational efficiency, electronic health record systems, practice workflows and supply-chain management.', 'Strong Q1 Results: ISRG’s solid first-quarter results also buoy optimism. Revenues were primarily driven by continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume. Intuitive Surgical has been raising the price of procedures to fight inflationary pressure, which also aided sales growth.Meanwhile, the absence of any significant disruptions from COVID during the first quarter aided results and may continue to boost procedure growth going forward.The gross margin and operating margin also improved. The declining trend in operating expenses is likely to continue in 2024 as well.', 'Supply Constraints Hurting Performance: Intuitive Surgical has been facing supply constraints for several instruments leading to a loss of sales as the company fails to meet demand. The ongoing geopolitical tensions with no resolution in the picture indicate that supply-chain issues are likely to persist, thereby continuing to hurt sales. The company expects da Vinci 5 system placements to be choppy in 2024 due to constrained supply, thereby hurting growth prospects for the device. Customers may delay orders and wait for adequate supply before buying the fifth-generation da Vinci 5. Although the extension of catheter life for the Ion modulation system should boost supply, catheter supply will remain challenging.', 'In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has improved 1.5% to $6.26 per share.', 'The consensus mark for the company’s revenues is pegged at $8.01 billion, indicating a 12.5% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.', '\xa0', 'Intuitive Surgical, Inc. price | Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

It has no match for its reach, with 4.3 billion credit and debit cards worldwide, easily outdoing any competition. That's a powerful moat, and it continuously invests in its business through technological innovation and partnerships to solidify its edge."", ""Its business model is fairly simple. Most of its revenue comes from swipe fees, which are the small payment it takes every time someone uses one of its cards. It has organic growth opportunities as more people become members and sign up for new cards. It sees its current addressable market in global payments as more $20 trillion, and its trailing-12-month total payments volume is more than $15 trillion, so it has ample room to increase that this year. It's working to capture more market share by expanding its network for paying bills like rent and education, and working with local networks to travel on Visa credentials."", ""But it's not stopping there. It is a leader in financial technology, or fintech, and it has launched better, faster payments and money-moving methods.

It's an asset-light company, and sales growth doesn't require much increased overhead or other expenses, leading to high profitability."", ""The standard argument for Visa's suitability as a stock candidate is that its performance matches the economy. Since the economy is overwhelmingly in growth mode, so is Visa. It has performed impressively during the past few years despite inflation, and many strong retail indicators are helping it along. However, the market often reflects overall investor sentiment, and that can override a company's real performance. The market has become more pessimistic lately, bringing down great stocks along with it."", ""The stock drop also reflects the market's forward-looking inclination. As the months drag on and the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates high, investors see less potential for a quick turnaround. Inflation and interest rates could stay high for longer than thought, and that is likely to eventually affect spending patterns. The high interest rates, in fact, are meant to limit spending and slow the economy, and the continued spending growth is damping the Fed's plans to end high inflation and cut rates. In that sense, Visa may have to endure some pressure before inflation is tempered."", 'As of the end of the second quarter, Visa is maintaining an optimistic outlook of low double-digit percentage revenue growth for both the fiscal third quarter and the full year.', ""Visa stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 31, but that's cheaper than its five-year average of 35."", ""Since its recent underwhelming performance, Visa stock is about in line with or slightly below the broader market's gains over various recent time periods.

Based on the closing price of $240.46 per share on May 10, the stock has a dividend yield of 1% and a payout ratio of 0.3%.Its decision to hike its quarterly dividend was attributable to a healthy balance sheet and effective capital allocation initiatives.', 'Marriott is committed to implementing effective capital allocation strategies that aid it in fostering its growth prospects.

However, this apparent setback has actually created favorable opportunities for long-term investors to identify undervalued stocks. Analysts also suggest piling into undervalued equities as these stocks have the potential to offer higher returns in the long run. Morningstar Chief US Market Strategist David Sekera also highlighted the same investment strategy in his second-quarter 2024 stock market outlook. Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“In our view, it is unlikely that what has worked for the last year and a half will be what continues to work. \xa0We think now is a good time for investors to look for contrarian investment opportunities, especially in those areas that have underperformed, are unloved—and most importantly—undervalued.”', 'Undervalued stocks are those that are trading below their intrinsic value. This means that the market price of these stocks does not truly reflect their worth. Investing in undervalued dividend stocks can be a good opportunity for investors as these equities provide a steady income stream even if the stock price doesn’t immediately appreciate. In addition to this, value stocks have shown strong performance over growth stocks over time. Studies conducted by Josef Lakonishok, a former finance professor at the University of Illinois, and David Dreman, a renowned expert in value investing, have highlighted that value stocks typically offer higher dividend yields and exhibit stronger fundamental ratios compared to high-flying growth stocks, as we reported in our article 30 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts. Their research indicated that value investing outpaces growth around 70% of the time, irrespective of the companies’ sizes. Across different company sizes, their analysis consistently demonstrated that value stocks yield average returns of a little over 7% per year higher than growth stocks over extended periods.', 'Despite the underperformance of dividend stocks in 2023, companies worldwide are steadily raising their dividend payouts as a strategy to draw investor interest. Global dividend growth has consistently shown an upward trend over the past years, especially after the pandemic of 2020.

From budget-friendly options such as Holiday Inn to the luxurious tapestry of Marriott's portfolio, the big hotel companies seem to be churning out new brands faster than ever."", 'But why the proliferation? And how exactly do these giant corporations manage such a vast network of properties?', 'Hotel Management Network dives into the world of brand proliferation in the hotel industry, exploring the reasons behind the trend and the intricate ownership structures that underpin it.', 'The hotel industry is witnessing a period of consolidation. The top ten hotel chains – companies such as Marriott International, Hilton, the InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), Hyatt and Accor – controlled a staggering 74.77% of the global market in 2022, according to Global Data, a leading data and analytics company.', 'This dominance allows them to leverage their brand recognition and loyalty programmes to attract guests, squeezing out smaller, independent players.', 'One key strategy the giants employ is brand proliferation. By offering a diverse range of brands catering to different budgets, travel styles and locations, they effectively capture a wider swathe of the market.', 'This approach allows the big players to cater to a range of needs under one corporate umbrella. It also mitigates risk – if economic downturns impact luxury travel, budget options can still perform well.', 'Marriott offers more than 30 brands under its umbrella. Its expansive portfolio encompasses everything from budget-friendly options such as Element by Westin to ultra-luxurious stays at the Ritz-Carlton.', 'IHG Hotels & Resorts, another major player, offers 19 brands, with a recent focus on adding luxury properties such as Six Senses Hotels Resorts Spas to an existing portfolio known for value-focused chain Holiday Inn Express and others like it.', ""Hilton has a collection of 22 brands catering to a variety of travellers' needs. These include established names such as Hilton Hotels & Resorts and Conrad Hotels & Resorts, alongside more recent additions such as Motto by Hilton, a micro-hotel brand targeted towards millennial travellers."", 'Accor, a European hospitality leader with a global presence, rounds out the group with a diverse portfolio of more than 50 brands, including luxury giants Raffles and Fairmont alongside midscale options such as Novotel and the budget-friendly chain ibis.', ""The sheer number of brands within each company's portfolio highlights the intense competition for guest loyalty in today's travel landscape. While offering a wider variety gives travellers more choice, it also presents challenges for hoteliers in effectively differentiating their brands and ensuring a consistent guest experience across their entire network."", 'While the sheer number of hotels under their banner might suggest otherwise, big hotel companies rarely own their physical properties themselves. Instead, they primarily operate under a franchise model.', 'In a franchise agreement, the hotel company (the franchisor) licenses its brand, operating system and loyalty programme to a third-party owner (the franchisee). The franchisee builds or acquires the hotel, manages day-to-day operations and pays the franchisor a fee for the right to use the brand.', 'This model offers several advantages for big hotel companies.', 'Firstly, it minimises capital expenditure. By focusing on brand development and royalties, they avoid the hefty costs associated with property ownership and management.', 'Secondly, it allows for rapid expansion. Franchisees take care of financing and development, enabling the brand to establish a nationwide, even global, presence quickly.', ""The franchise model isn't a monolith. There's a spectrum of ownership structures within the hotel industry. Here's a breakdown of some key variations:"", 'Franchise agreements: the most common model. The franchisee has significant operational control but adheres to brand standards set by the franchisor.', ""Management agreements: the hotel company manages the property on behalf of the owner for a fee. The owner retains ownership but outsources day-to-day operations to leverage the brand's expertise."", 'Leases: the hotel company leases a property from an owner and operates it under one of its brands. This allows them to participate in the revenue stream without direct ownership.', 'Owned and operated hotels: less commonly, big hotel companies might own and operate a select number of hotels, often flagship properties or those in key strategic locations.', ""One of the challenges of brand proliferation is maintaining brand consistency across a vast network of properties. Franchisees have a degree of autonomy, and ensuring they uphold the brand's standards is crucial."", 'Big hotel companies address this through stringent franchise agreements that outline operational guidelines, quality control measures and marketing requirements. They also provide support services such as training programmes and operational manuals to ensure consistency in guest experience.', ""But a completely uniform offering across all locations wouldn't necessarily resonate with travellers."", ""Savvy hotel companies allow for some local flair. Franchisees might have flexibility in adapting menus to reflect regional cuisine or incorporating local design elements into the hotel's décor. This allows the brand to maintain its core identity while acknowledging the value of local appeal."", 'The trend of brand proliferation in the hotel industry is likely to continue. As travel becomes more accessible to a wider range of demographics, there will be a growing demand for hotels that cater to specific needs and preferences.', 'Big hotel companies, with their vast resources and experience, are well-positioned to capitalise on this.', 'However, the future of this model might see a shift towards a more nuanced approach. We might see brands catering to even more niche markets, offering hyper-personalised experiences.', 'Technology could also play a bigger role in ensuring brand consistency across a geographically dispersed network.', 'Ultimately, the success of brand proliferation hinges on its ability to deliver value to both guests and franchisees.', 'Travellers seek a diverse range of options that cater to their specific needs, while franchisees require a successful brand model that provides support, drives bookings and delivers a healthy return on investment.', 'As the industry evolves, big hotel companies will need to strike a delicate balance between brand proliferation and brand differentiation to maintain their dominance in an increasingly competitive landscape.', ""The hotel industry's brand landscape is a complex ecosystem driven by market dominance, franchise models and the need to cater to diverse traveller needs. While brand proliferation allows big hotel companies to capture a wider market share, it requires careful management to ensure brand consistency and value for both guests and franchisees."", 'As technology and traveller preferences continue to evolve, the future of brand proliferation will depend on the ability of big hotel companies to adapt and innovate.', '""Hotel giants’ ever-growing brands – why so many, and how are they managed?"" was originally created and published by Hotel Management Network, a GlobalData owned brand.', '', '\xa0', 'The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

The promotions’ terms often require the user to remain subscribed to the carrier’s high-end plan (to be eligible for the maximum promotional value) which ensures higher ARPU over determined period of time (24-36 months). Trade-ins also bode well for upgraders and switchers who are looking to obtain the next trendy device without having to go through the hassle of selling their existing handset or disposing the device.', 'However, trade-in offers only apply to customers with a suitable device to divest, often excluding first time users and those with older devices, forcing them to cough up the entire cost of new flagship devices.', 'This quarter, Verizon and AT&T experimented with offering multiple promotion types on their premium devices to counter demand fatigue brought about by the change to their EIPs (Equipment instalment policies)- both carriers extended their EIP terms from 24 and/or 30 months to 36 months in a likely effort to reduce monthly premiums.', 'In Q1, Verizon began offering its iPhone 15 series and premium Pixel device users a competitive mix of unique offers and trade-in offers, enabling customers to pick the promotion that would maximise their savings. Unique promotional offers featured up to a $720 discount on select devices such as the Pixel Fold on Verizon’s Ultimate plan, allowing users without a viable trade-in device to still take advantage of high-value discount offers. Like Verizon, AT&T also suffered from a softening of demand due to an extension of its device instalment terms in 2021.', 'To counter this trend, the carrier offered its users a combination of promotions on select devices, enabling them to pick the option that maximises their savings. While this practice is not novel (rival T-Mobile has offered a combination of promotion types on its premium devices for a while now), it is an indication of an upcoming trend where more carriers are willing to allow their users to pick promotional offers that maximises their savings. This practice is likely to gain momentum in the upcoming months where the impending downturn of the economy is unlikely to have users lining up to trade in their somewhat new and functional device to take on the additional financial responsibility of the latest model.', 'Pushing promotions such as BOGOs (buy one, get one free) on a regular basis will also help carriers control their inventory especially during the holidays. Tier one carriers generally set the tone for the rest of the industry and if AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile continue this trend of offering multiple promotion options on flagship devices, it’s only a matter of time before straightforward discounts without a trade in become the norm rather than the exception.', '""US carriers reshape smartphone promotions in customer’s favour"" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.', '', '\xa0', 'The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Evidence suggests its growth spurt will continue as Arm's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- made up of contractually obligated sales that haven't yet been booked as revenue -- rose 45%.

For Micron's fiscal 2024 Q2 (ended Feb. 29), the company generated revenue of $5.82 billion, up 58% year over year and 23% quarter over quarter. Furthermore, robust demand drove strong price increases.

That's when Nvidia reports Q1 FY 2025 results, which will give investors some clues as to how strong the market is for Nvidia's class-leading GPUs (graphics processing units)."", ""With how big of a move Nvidia's stock has made after previous earnings releases, it may be wise to consider buying (or selling) some shares before then. I've analyzed Nvidia and come up with three reasons to buy and one to sell. So what should you do before May 22?"", ""Nvidia's primary product, the GPU, is vital for AI model development and training. GPUs allow parallel processing, giving them the ability to do multiple tasks at the same time. This is crucial for training AI models, as multiple iterations must occur before an AI model is usable."", ""Nvidia's GPUs are the best on the market for AI training, and its customers are buying thousands of them at a time to outfit their servers with the best technology possible."", ""This caused Nvidia's initial boom last year, but some investors (including myself) were worried that there would be little demand for more capacity once initial demand is satisfied. However, that isn't the case."", 'Meta Platforms raised its long-term capital expenditure guidance to build more computing power to capture the massive AI opportunity it sees. On its conference call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mentioned that they have about 35,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs active, with another 85,000 slated to be up and running by the end of this year.', ""The demand for Nvidia's products is still there, which should bode well for it this quarter."", ""One gripe about Nvidia's stock has been how expensive it is. That's true if you look at the trailing-price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. At 76 times earnings, it could be considered outrageously expensive. But that doesn't do the stock justice. Nvidia is undergoing a massive transformation and is expected to post another massive quarter of growth (Wall Street projects 250% growth in Q1)."", 'As a result, looking at trailing earnings does investors no good. Instead,they should utilize the forward P/E to value Nvidia.', ""At 36 times forward earnings estimates, Nvidia is far from cheap. However, it's undergoing a massive shift, and this figure could be incredibly off the mark if Nvidia's growth continues. Furthermore, it's not far off from Microsoft, which trades at 35 times forward earnings despite growing much slower."", ""If valuation is a top reason to avoid Nvidia's stock, you may need to rethink that, as many other stocks trade in a similar range as Nvidia despite not having the growth."", ""Although Nvidia may have some of the best products on the market, it isn't resting on its laurels. Nvidia has launched a few new upgraded GPUs, like the Blackwell GPU. But what investors (and many companies) are waiting for is the H200."", ""This system is expected to launch in the second quarter of 2024 and is a massive upgrade over the already popular H100. Some companies may be holding out until the H200 is launched to future-proof their servers, as they don't want to upgrade in a couple of years when the H100s become obsolete."", ""Although that's speculation, the H200 will undoubtedly drive new demand, especially from companies willing to pay top dollar to have the best products available."", ""These are great reasons to buy Nvidia's stock before its Q1 earnings date, but there's also a reason to sell."", ""While I mentioned that Nvidia's stock isn't as expensive as many think, it's still priced for perfection. If Nvidia misses the mark in any way this quarter, there will likely be a heavy sell-off."", ""I think that's unlikely because the heavy demand for Nvidia's GPUs is still present. However, the company's execution is unknown until investors see the financials."", 'Should Nvidia report a less-than-perfect quarter, investors must examine the situation more closely to determine whether the sell-off is warranted or a buying opportunity.', 'Although the odds of this happening are pretty low, something as simple as a slip-up or a tone on a conference call can make or break a stock.', ""With how the industry currently looks, I see no problem with buying Nvidia's stock before Q1 results, as it's slated to be another quarter of incredibly strong growth."", 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

It's unlikely that AI breaks this streak, which would leave Nvidia's stock highly vulnerable to downside."", 'It\'s also hard to ignore the competitive pressures the company is liable to face in the coming months. Aside from direct external competition from the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia has to cope with the fact that most of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies are developing in-house GPUs for their data centers. That\'s a problem when 40% of Nvidia\'s net sales come from four members of the Magnificent Seven.', ""Regulators have put a glass ceiling above Nvidia, as well.

The incorporation of AI and machine learning should improve patient care and lead to more informed decision-making."", ""This is a company that's undeniably enjoying first-mover competitive advantages. Through the end of March, it had nearly 8,900 of its da Vinci systems installed worldwide, which is far more robotic-assisted surgical systems than any of its competitors. Since these systems are pricey, and it takes quite a bit of time to train surgeons to use them, the company tends to keep its customers for a long time."", ""Another reason Intuitive Surgical has been such a phenomenal investment for so long is its razor-and-blades operating model. Although its da Vinci systems are pricey (often $0.5 million to $2.5 million), they're intricate and costly to build. Where the company generates its juiciest margins is from selling instruments with each procedure, as well as servicing these systems. These higher-margin categories have grown into a larger percentage of total sales over time, allowing earnings per share (EPS) to increase at a faster pace than its sales."", ""I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that the company's robotic-assisted surgical systems are still just scratching the surface with regard to their potential.

While user growth isn't everything, it marked the first time Pinterest surpassed the half-billion MAU mark. This suggests the platform is resonating with a growing percentage of the global population."", ""Having 518 million MAUs has its perks on the advertising side, too. Merchants are realizing that Pinterest's MAUs tend to be motivated shoppers. More importantly, there aren't too many social media platforms that can reach 518 million sets of eyeballs. As Pinterest's social media clout grows, so does its ability to command stronger ad-pricing power."", ""Pinterest's straightforward operating model also provides a competitive advantage relative to most social media platforms. Whereas most social sites rely heavily on likes and data-tracking tools to help advertisers target users with their message(s), Pinterest's entire operating model hinges on its MAUs willingly and freely sharing the things, places, and services that interest them. Even if app developers continue to clamp down on data-tracking tools, this won't be much of a hinderance to Pinterest's platform."", ""With Pinterest's growth rate reaccelerating, it's easy to see why select billionaires can't get enough of this stock."", 'Before you buy stock in Intuitive Surgical, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intuitive Surgical wasn’t one of them.

Though not all were exactly recommendations, I also didn’t say “steer clear” either. For example, in my article “3 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Betting on Big Time,” I noted Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) had a very weak business model but said perhaps the discount the stock was offering at the time (down 50%) might be enough to attract some investors.

Caveat emptor!', 'Source: dotshock / Shutterstock', 'In retrospect, the case for Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) was easy to make. The need for data centers was growing exponentially and the real estate investment trust (REIT) was the biggest owner of data centers in the world with over 300 facilities.

However, there was one that he was buying: Bank of America. He had bought nearly 23 million shares, giving him more than 1 billion shares total.', 'The reason to ride Buffett’s coattails was easy. Consumers were fleeing small, less financially stable banks and heading to larger, more mature institutions like BoA. Its assets were at risk in the high interest rate environment we were suffering through, but it was also padding its net interest income from the loans it was making.', 'I noted the other day interest rates had caused Bank of America’s unrealized losses to balloon to $122.8 billion, but since almost all were in its held-to-maturity portfolio there was no need to move them to the realized column.

Because it focused solely on the central and south American markets, it was betting on their economies growing and expanding more than more developed markets.', 'MercadoLibre was seeing solid growth in gross merchandise volumes and total payment volumes as consumers increasingly became more digitally aware. It has the leading e-commerce platform in the region where growth was soaring by 25% or more and its Mercado Pago fintech platform was seeing a doubling in usage.', 'I had noted that at first glance the stock might not seem cheap since it traded at 56 times earnings estimates but because profits margins were readily inflating it would grow into the premium.

That means customers pay for the capacity of its transmission lines or its storage tanks and whether or not they are actually used, the industry middleman still gets paid. So it doesn’t matter what the price of oil or gas is today, Enterprise Products Partners still gets paid.', 'The one wrinkle, of course, is that EPD is structured as an MLP. Because MLPs are required by law to distribute 90% or more of their profits to investors as dividends, they introduce more complicated tax considerations. I’ve noted an investor may not want to own an MLP in a normally tax-deferred individual retirement account because you could end up owing taxes.

While both have come down from record levels, they remain well above historical trends.', 'That would bode well for aftermarket auto parts companies like Genuine Parts. Drivers will keep their existing vehicles operating longer to keep from having to buy a new one. So although interest rates kept consumers from financing new car purchases, inflation was also hitting them in the pocketbook. They just curtailed their spending. It’s a situation that is playing out across many industries now as the Federal Reserve’s higher-for-longer policies take their toll.', 'What eases the pain of Genuine Part’s softness is its dividend, which it has increased for over 50 years.

Especially after the company slashed its dividend from 24 cents to 5 cents, a move Buffett called “not good news,” he was resigned to see what transpired with the stock.', 'Shares bounced 27% off their lows in recent weeks as the movie studio negotiates a sale of the company. It’s complicated though, because Shari Redstone owns a controlling interest. Her objectives are not necessarily the same as the rest of the shareholders. She is trying to merge Paramount with Hollywood studio Skydance in an exclusive arrangement but the board said she should have entertained the offer from private equity firm Apollo Global Management, which is working with Sony Pictures to acquire the company.', 'There will be more negotiations for the movie and streaming company that does own some valuable assets. And it may come down to Paramount Global eventually becoming someone else’s problem out of the limelight of Wall Street. It won’t be Buffett’s though.

Because they are heavily regulated and required to maintain, upgrade and repair their facilities, high interest rates inflates their borrowing costs. At the same time, they are subject to the whims of local utility boards in whether they win rate increases.', 'Yet that’s also one of their more attractive aspects too. They are a known quantity with a reliable business model that generates a substantial revenue stream. They use that money to pay handsome dividends to shareholders. American States Water has been among the best, paying a dividend for 87 consecutive years. It has increased the payout for 69 straight years.', 'Unfortunately, the macroeconomic environment weighs more heavily on its stock price. And because of profligate spending in Washington, inflation is remaining intransigent causing the Fed further delay any hoped-for rate cuts. Inflation is heading in the wrong direction again. Although chairman Jerome Powell says new rate hikes are “unlikely,” that doesn’t mean they are not possible.', 'It looked a lot better for AWR when there was talk of three, four, or even six possible rate cuts. Now, cuts seem off the table for most of the year and increases could be back on the table.

Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.61 per share on the 1st of July. This means that the annual payment will be 2.9% of the current stock price, which is in line with the average for the industry.', ' Check out our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide ', ""We aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Before making this announcement, the company's dividend was higher than its profits, and made up 78% of cash flows. While the cash payout ratio isn't necessarily a cause for concern, the company is probably focusing more on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 97.5%. Assuming the dividend continues along the course it has been charting recently, our estimates show the payout ratio being 50% which brings it into quite a comfortable range.', 'The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $1.40, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.44. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.7% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.', ""The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Over the past five years, it looks as though C.H. Robinson Worldwide's EPS has declined at around 12% a year. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited."", ""In summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about C.H. Robinson Worldwide's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. We can't deny that the payments have been very stable, but we are a little bit worried about the very high payout ratio. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment."", ""Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've picked out 3 warning signs for C.H. Robinson Worldwide that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

The rules of the game had already been changing. Once upon a time, all Wall Street rewarded was subscriber growth as numerous platforms flooded the market. Profitability? Who cared. Free cash flow? Never heard of her.', 'The goal was to attract as many users as possible. That led to an era of overspending as platforms raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.', 'At the time, Netflix (NFLX) was the ringleader. The platform secured famed producer Ryan Murphy with a high-profile $300 million contract in 2018. ""Bridgerton"" creator Shonda Rhimes also signed with the company around that time, locking in a reported $100 million deal.', 'Others soon followed. In 2019, Warner Bros. Discovery (then known as WarnerMedia) reportedly coughed up more than $1 billion for the streaming rights to ""The Big Bang Theory."" Comcast\'s NBCUniversal (CMCSA) shelled out $500 million for ""The Office"" streaming rights that same year. Even Big Tech was all in, with Apple (AAPL) sinking $6 billion into the launch of Apple TV+, which only offered nine original series at the time.', ""Then Wall Street started to change its tune. Could streaming — an incredibly cheap way for consumers to access their favorite content at the touch of a button — become an actual business? Investors weren't so sure. The industry scrambled to prove them wrong."", ""There were price hikes and password-sharing crackdowns. Ad-supported tiers and mass layoffs. That helped with streaming profitability across the board, although the majority of companies (minus Netflix and WBD) still don't make money in those divisions."", 'Recently, partnerships and bundled offerings among competing media companies have become more of a trend in an effort to combat not only profitability challenges but also a more fickle consumer.', 'Last week, Disney (DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery announced a new bundle that will bring together Disney+, Hulu, and Max streaming services.', ""Earlier this year, Warner Bros. announced a sports streaming partnership with Disney's ESPN and Fox (FOXA), set to debut later this fall. In December, WBD partnered with Netflix on a $10 ad-supported bundle offered through Verizon (VZ)."", ""The competitors' embrace signals a clear shift for the industry as consolidation lurks around the corner with Paramount currently seeking a buyout while WBD has also been at the center of M&A talks after its two-year post-merger lockup period officially ended."", 'As David Zaslav put it last week, ""There\'s more strength together.""

That heightens the dilemma: buy, sell, or hold Disney stock? As always when considering the big question, it's most important to focus on the long-term story and skip the short-term antics. Let's see where Disney could be in a year from now and how that should influence investors."", ""The big win for Disney in the second-quarter report was the dramatic improvement in streaming losses. The big shakeup that left former CEO Bob Chapek out and brought back Bob Iger was heavily influenced by high streaming losses, and part of the company's new strategy is a stronger focus on generating profits from Disney+ and Disney's other streaming networks."", 'Without the unprofitable ESPN+ service, streaming produced $47 million in operating income, reaching the goal of profitability. Total streaming loss was $18 million, and Iger reiterated that combined streaming would be profitable in the fiscal fourth quarter. Disney+ added 6 million subscribers in the quarter, although Disney+Hotstar subscribers decreased 6%.', ""In a year from now, streaming should be fully profitable, and if management is running it efficiently, it should stay that way. However, just as subscription growth isn't linear, streaming profits might have their ups and downs."", 'Linear networks are still dragging down entertainment as cord-cutting continues and advertisers follow viewers to streaming. Linear networks sales dropped 8% from last year while operating income was down 22%. This trend is likely to continue, but it may plateau in an improved economy when companies raise their advertising budgets.', ""Overall, Disney reported a 1% increase in revenue year over year, but earnings per share (EPS) fell to a $0.01 loss per share. It took a hit from a goodwill impairment related to its partial sale of Star India for less than it paid for it, which hurt Disney's profitability. Hotstar lost the rights to certain cricket matches, sending many customers packing and prompting Disney's partial exit. Adjusted EPS, which is exclusive of the impairment, increased 30% year over year to $1.21, exceeding expectations."", 'A year from now, this specific incident will be water under the bridge. Disney is a large company with varied businesses. In some ways that works in its favor, since most of the time, at least some of its businesses are performing well. However, underperforming parts can pull it down.', 'The experiences (meaning parks) segment was solid in the second quarter, with a 10% increase year over year. Its operating income increased 12%. This segment is still enjoying elevated demand from its post-closure phase, but demand may be slowing down now. Management said it expects the third quarter to be ""roughly comparable"" to last year.', 'Disney said it would invest $60 billion in parks over the next 10 years. Parks are a key element of the overall entertainment model, offering an unparalleled experience for fans of its franchises. The model works through a cycle of entertainment in content and experiences, and providing these experiences for loyal fans creates relationships that fuel further growth. A year from now, growth might be steadier as it phases out the high growth and the slower aftermath.', ""Disney owns several film studios, including Pixar and Marvel, and it typically accounts for many of the top-grossing films at the box office in any given year. In 2023, it published four out of the top 10 box office performers. However, it hasn't had any recent hits. Its first-year results were also up against the Avatar sequel that was released in December of 2022 and was still racking up receipts at theaters in early 2023."", ""But there's a large slate of potential megahits coming up for release later on in 2024, including Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King. Disney also has several highly anticipated films coming out in 2025, such as Avatar 3, and it has three new Marvel films coming out within the next 12 months."", ""Disney is a powerhouse entertainment company when all its parts are working well. There's a distinct possibility that this could be the case a year from now: Parks should be at full speed, with new rides and experiences; streaming should be profitable and growing; the new ESPN will have been launched. And Disney will have released several movies likely to be hits. There may be bumps ahead. One thing seems very likely, though: It will get there at some point."", 'Regardless of what happens this year, Disney has incredible assets in its studios, franchises, and unparalleled global theme parks, and it should reward long-term investors.', 'Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walt Disney wasn’t one of them.

While the entertainment giant did demonstrate some positive progress in its strategic evolution during the quarter, with retained momentum in its parks and profitability improvements across the board, challenges persist. Notably, its legacy TV channels are struggling, and its Direct-to-Consumer division faces stiff competition, hindering its potential. Thus, my stance on the stock remains neutral.', 'Disney’s Entertainment segment, which makes up about 44% of the company’s revenue mix, had an underwhelming period in Q2. Segment revenues declined by 5% to $9.8 billion for the quarter, as declines in its Linear Networks division and content sales/licensing couldn’t be offset by some growth driven in the DTC business. See below.', 'More specifically, Linear Networks posted revenues of $2.77 billion, down 8% from last year, due to both domestic and international challenges. On the domestic front, Linear Networks faced hardships due to declining subscribers, which, in turn, was due to the non-renewal of carriage of certain networks.', 'A drop in ad revenue following lower impressions due to softer average viewership also negatively impacted this segment. Clearly, Disney Channel, National Geographic, and ESPN, among other channels, keep losing appeal.', 'The bullish perspective might argue that Disney effectively addresses the inevitable decline of traditional television by strengthening its DTC arm within the Entertainment segment through the expansion of Disney+. Nevertheless, it’s essential to highlight two key considerations in this context.', 'The first consideration here is that even though DTC revenues grew by 14% in Q2, this was mainly due to higher pricing, as Disney+ actually lost subscribers compared to last year. Worldwide subscribers fell to 153.6 million, down from 157.8 million last year.', 'Disney is clearly struggling against stiff competition in this field. Evidently, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) revved its subscriber growth to 16% year-over-year during the same period, to 269.6 million members. This is despite having already captured a much larger chunk of the market.', 'The second consideration is that DTC revenue falls significantly short of the profitability seen in Linear Networks. Consequently, while Disney may manage to substitute Linear Networks’ revenue with DTC earnings, replicating the same profit margins would prove challenging. Although the DTC sector has shown improvement, transitioning from a $587 million operating loss to a $47 million operating profit in Q2 of this year, it’s evident that the business is still hovering around the breakeven point.', 'Shifting gears to the brighter side of Disney’s Q2, we see its remarkable performance in the Parks & Experiences division. Revenues from Parks & Experiences grew by 10% year-over-year to $8.4 billion, as you can see below. This was due to better Walt Disney World Resort and Disney Cruise Line results. In turn, these businesses benefited from higher guest spending due to higher average ticket prices. The fact that Disney keeps increasing its ticket prices while still attracting massive crowds is absolutely phenomenal.', 'Therefore, Disney was able to achieve a higher operating income from parks, which increased by 12% to $2.29 billion. Combined with DTC cutting down its operating losses, as I mentioned previously, and overall efforts to improve profitability, you can see how Disney’s total operating income grew by 17% to $3.85 billion.', 'Despite seeing some improvements in Disney’s bottom line in its Q2 report, the overall investment case fails to inspire confidence given its current valuation. The outlook for the Entertainment segment appears grim as traditional channels lose traction and Disney’s DTC fails to rise above the competition. Further, the stagnant state of the Sports segment merits little attention. Lastly, the Experiences segment appears solid. Yet, a question remains: how long can Disney keep raising prices before facing demand constraints?', 'Given this picture, I don’t see the stock having further upside from its current levels. At about 22.3 times this year’s expected adjusted EPS, I would argue Disney is fairly valued at best, if not modestly overvalued. Given that interest rates remain high and Disney fails to produce a decent earnings yield and/or dividend yield, this risk is worth considering.', 'Peeking at Wall Street’s outlook on the stock, Walt Disney features a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. Despite my more cautious view, at $133.55, the average\xa0Disney stock price projection implies 26.2% upside potential.', 'In my view, Disney’s Q2 results were a mixed bag. While the Experiences segment shined through strong performance in Parks, the Entertainment segment faces worrisome challenges, particularly when it comes to the decline of legacy TV and stiff competition in the DTC space. Considering these factors alongside Disney’s current valuation, my outlook on the stock remains neutral, as uncertainties linger over its future.', 'Disclosure']"

I'm Dylan Lewis joining me over the airwaves, Motley Fool senior analysts, Andy Cross and Ron Gross. Fools, great to have you both here."", 'Andy Cross: Hey Dylan.', 'Ron Gross: How are you doing Dylan?', ""Dylan Lewis: This week we've got advice for college grads, stocks on our radar and some tough reactions to company earnings. We're going to kick off there, Ron, the House of Mouse, shrinking a little bit this week, shares of Disney down 9% following earnings. To me, really the sign of the times for the company was, this is the fourth quarter in a row Disney has posted results below expectation."", 'Ron Gross: Don\'t be a hater, Dylan. This is Disney we\'re talking about. It had been having a nice rebound this year. It survived Nelson Peltz is proxy fight. Things were looking up. But this, as you say, was a rough week for the stock. There was a lot of good in the earnings report, but also a fair amount that spooked investors. Let\'s hit the good side first. Management said it is close to making its streaming business profitable, and the streaming unit lost only $18 million in the quarter versus $659 million for example, this time last year. If you exclude ESPN Plus it actually earned a profit of $47 million. That\'s positive. CEO Bob Iger said the company is on track to achieve streaming profitability in the final quarter of the fiscal year that ends in September. Disney Plus added more than six million customers in the quarter that beat expectations. Theme parks look pretty solid, up 10% on the revenue side, operating income was up 12%. But that actually was a little weaker than investors had been expected. Management raised its full-year guidance for EPS growth of 25% from previously 20%. Now if we turn to the more concerning side, that traditional TV business that we\'ve talked about time after time continues to suffer from declining viewership. It was hurting the quarter-by declining ad revenue. Domestic operating income at ESPN fell 9%. If we look at the theme parks, they\'re seeing some what they\'re calling ""Moderation"" in this peak post-COVID travel that they had been enjoying. But what really got investors spoke was the guidance for the streaming business, which offset some of the other positive remarks. They said, we\'re forecasting a loss for entertainment direct-to-consumer in the third quarter that is mostly tied to its platform in India, but still. They said they do not expect to see core subscriber growth at Disney Plus in the third quarter but we\'ll return to growth in the fourth-quarter, investors did not like to see that sold the stock off at a pretty healthy clip.', ""Dylan Lewis: One of the things that's interesting to me with this is we have the financial story of streaming and what's going on with entertainment business. We also have the strategic element of how they are approaching their IP library. We got some updates from management talking a little bit about their content slate and basically saying, when it comes to their Marvel franchise and streaming shows, they are going to slow things down. They are going to be limiting the number of Marvel films to three per year and to Disney Plus shows per year. Andy, when you look at that, do you feel there's an acknowledgment that maybe we overinvested and maybe we stretch some of these franchises a little thin?"", ""Andy Cross: It's definitely that, Iger has talked about that. You can't go from a 650 million loss to an 18 million loss without cutting back some corners here. So they stretched way over on the Marvel side. I continue to think that's a good move for them. Ron laid out the pros and cons from the quarter, but there's just a lot of pros in there. They can't get it all right. The subscriber estimates, forecasts for that for the next coming quarters might be a little bit light, but just looking at the free cash flow line continued to improve. The earnings per share is going to be up 25% this year. They think they continue to make lots of progress and making that streaming business much more profitable and not the sinkhole than it used to be. I applaud that I think as the biggest checkbox, the theme park business is going to be a little cyclical. If the consumer is a little bit tight right now. We're hearing that across the board from some other company. I'm not too surprised by that but overall I thought it was a pretty solid quarter and another one that Bob Iger can flip up, put behind them."", ""Dylan Lewis: Tweak again,20 what pay 21 times for Disney. It's Disney. That seems OK to me. Plus you get it back a little dividend. Now that that's back little bit under 1%. This is a company. I have one for probably two decades and have no intention of selling it."", ""Andy Cross: I think maybe we get a little bit of an increase in the dividend and maybe a little bit more on the share buyback. But it's, it's not the worst thing in the world for them to continue to focus on building out that business. But then when you're right on the properties, they got to get that slate right because that's a, that's a big driver of all the future value of Disney."", ""Dylan Lewis: Shopify also having a bit of a rough week, the eCommerce in a Box company logging its worst day ever dropping 20% following earnings. Andy, over the last year-and-a-half, it seemed Shopify was really battling back from the post-COVID slump. Shares have gone on quite a run. Seems like the company had gotten itself back on track with growth story. This earnings report feels a little bit more like a setback. What's the story?"", ""Andy Cross: Well, it is a little bit, however, it just looking at some of the numbers, the quarter, the gross merchandise value grew 23% versus 15% a year ago. But as you had talked about some of the profit picture, I think has some investors a little bit to concern. I think it's a little bit of an overkill that 20% drop was significant. I'm an owner and I know many listeners are out there too, so that's painful. But if you look at the revenues were up 23%, up 29%. If you back out the logistics business, they sold out subscription revenues up 34% versus 21% a year ago. Merchant Solutions up 20% versus 31% a year ago, that subscription revenue is higher-margin, so it's good to see that then the Merchant Solutions that's going to switch a little bit over the next quarter, which is going to impact a little bit the margins. The monthly recurring revenue got a lot of conversation deal and that was up 32% to 151 million versus just 10% growth a year ago. So they're making progress on that. That was actually a deceleration from last quarter's growth. That monthly revenue investors want to see continued grow over time because that is a good forecast of the future growth, obviously. That deceleration happens, they didn't like that. However, the company talked about how it's a little bit of a change and how they're recognizing some of the trials. They think most of the deceleration is due to that recognition less about the business is slowing because they continue to think businesses are very positive. Gross payment volumes of 32% gross margin, as I mentioned, improving. Operating expenses 4% lower. All the things have Shopify has been doing over the last year or so continued to show here. It's a little bit with the growth story as you mentioned and a little bit of the free cash flow margin not improving as much for the rest of the year. That has invested a little bit concerned that the growth picture is slowing. That's a little exaggeration. The stock that's sold off was a little bit too dramatic in my mind."", ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to stick with big movers, shareholders of Roblox knowing exactly how Shopify shareholders are feeling, shares down 20% post earnings. Ron, on the surface, things look pretty good. A lot of strong user growth and usage numbers coming in. But it seems what Roblox management is saying is somewhat similar to what we're hearing from Shopify and a little bit from Disney here, we're expecting a little bit of a slowdown here with the consumer."", ""Ron Gross: Slow down and when you're priced the way the stock is priced, slowdowns do not go over very well. The stock really did get slammed on this report, a result of a softer outlook for the current quarter that we're in now, worse than analysts had expected. The company lowered their guidance, but the report itself had strong numbers taken in a vacuum, revenue up 20%, bookings up 19%, average daily users up 17%. But you got to put up even better numbers than that probably for a company that is priced this way. Company's still losing money, management lowered their guidance, so we've got to watch out for how this company is priced. There's a lot of stock-based compensation here. They're only cash-flow positive if we back out a billion dollars worth of stock-based comp. While a lot of my colleagues really liked this stock, it's very hard for me to get my head around from a valuation perspective."", ""Andy Cross: Ron, you hit it right on the head with the stock-based compensation. I hate to see that. Wish they would really try to get that under control to drive actual real earnings growth. That's been one of my criticisms of them. April and May they saw daily active users and U.S. and Canadian bookings back above that 20% mark deal. That's the magic line for Roblox. They got to stay above that 20% mark there. See that at their older than 13 cohorts, age 13 cohorts growing above that level, they got to get there. There were some encouraging at the end of April and into May. But they are being very cautious for the rest of the year but that growth is going to be a little bit harder to come by. That's really gotten the concerns from the investor community."", ""Dylan Lewis: One of the things I was curious about with this report and the management team is this is a business that is relatively new to the guidance game. I think they only started providing guidance a quarter or two ago. How are you as investors looking at the commentary you're getting from management, the expectations you're coming from management, knowing that it's something that's relatively new in terms of disclosure for them?"", ""Ron Gross: I liked that there'll be more open disclosing. They talked about their advertising business not being material, but they're making lots of investments, including that partnership with PubMatic and a real-world test with Walmart. I'd like to see all that, but that's not going to be anything happening this year until next year, at the best. They're still working through these metrics around daily active users and bookings. Now we're seeing bookings grow faster than the users numbers and the growth numbers. You want to see that the other way around because eventually, those bookings will catch up. They still have some work to do to be transparent and to be a little bit more accurate and clear. Right now they're taking a very cautious approach for the next quarter or two."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, we've got a little more commentary on advertising, energy drinks and the state of travel. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis, joined on air by Andy Cross and Ron Gross. The earnings beat continues. We have updates from Airbnb, Celsius and Trade Desk. We'll kick off with TTD. Andy, we had some big moves in our first segment, more of a muted market response to Trade Desk's results. Company revenue rose to just under 500 million, showing some strong growth this quarter. Seemed like in a lot of ways, a business-as-usual quarter."", ""Andy Cross: Well, Dylan business as usual but there's a lot of change going on in the advertise market if you believe the Trade Desk and I do, there's a big strategic shift toward Connected Television and a cookie-less world that they've been investing for and preparing for the last few years. As you mentioned, strong revenue growth up 20% year-over-year. That's an acceleration from the 21% a year ago. Profitability, they had their operating cash flow, they're operating profit at 162 million. That was a margin of 33% versus 20% a year ago, connected TV remains the fastest-growing channel for The Trade Desk. It's contributing significantly the company's growth and they're really excited around some of the partnerships like with Roku that could leave to open up significant CTV, Connected TV inventory, the retail medium, that's the advertising through retail channels that continues to see strong momentum. We're hearing that from the likes of Amazon and others and that's a big growth opportunity for The Trade Desk, international expansions, all good. The UID 2.0 initiative in this cookie-less world is an investment they are very positive on, they are using AI to invest in Kokai. That's their platform from AI, continue to make all the right investments and Trade Desk, which is leading the way when it comes to connected television and advertising tech."", ""Dylan Lewis: Andy, last segment, we were talking about several companies painting a little bit of a down picture for 2024 and the rest of the year. I would've expected that to materialize and some of the advertising commentary from The Trade Desk, but that doesn't seem to be the case."", ""Andy Cross: It's not Dylan and I think we're hearing a lot of positive commentary finally coming from some of the ad tech companies and we're seeing in some of the results from the likes of Meta and Amazon and others, when you look at what all the spend going on in advertising, especially when it comes to things like connected television and like I said before, Trade Desk is innovating and now they're doing a lot into the AI world, which is helping their clients get more efficient. I love those investments."", ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to stick with companies in the red Airbnb down 7% this week after reporting earnings that on the surface, Ron didn't look too bad."", ""Ron Gross: Agreed some good things to like about this report and the stock didn't get smacked, still up 8% for the year so they had been having a nice year, I gave a little back as a result of this report. But as we said, some good metrics here, revenue up 18%, that's better than expected. Gross bookings rose 12% and that was driven by 9.5% increase in nights and experiences booked. Number of active listings in the first quarter grew 15%. Supply has continued to grow at a double-digit pace across all regions. We need supply to continue to come in strong in addition to demand. Profit 264 million, that's up from 117 million, so making good headway there. Now the disappointment was in the future guidance, as let's face it always seems to be, specifically revenue was light and the reasons given were what management called quote, significant sequential headwind, timing of the Easter holiday, inclusion of Leap Day in Q1 and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes. I think we are seeing some just general weakness, we saw it when Marriott reported as well. Not that surprising. They did reiterate to 2024 guidance though, so nothing too dramatic going on. They expect the Paris Olympics, the Euro Cup in Germany to help in the third quarter. We'll see if that comes true."", 'Dylan Lewis: Ron, when we were talking Disney earlier, it seemed like there was a pent-up demand for travel and in their case, the amusement parks that really helped the business about a year ago and that we are now lapping that and maybe some of that demand has been satisfied. Is it a similar story here with pent-up travel, just starting to moderate a little bit for Airbnb.', ""Ron Gross: I think that's fair and I do think we saw that in others as well. Marriott for example, international remains really strong but their US seems to be, I think the word was cooling. We're seeing that across the board in some of these travel-related companies."", ""Dylan Lewis: Love a euphemism, cooling. Always great. We cannot be all down this week. We're going to wrap with a positive earnings story. Shares of beverage makers Celsius feeling the energy this week up 15% and Andy, if I'm not mistaken, you are fueling the energy a little bit next week sipping some Celsius as we take."", ""Andy Cross: [laughs] Yes, that is true, having a little bit of Celsius as we're going to tape this. But the emerging energy and fitness beverage company that is continuing to take and grow the market for energy and fitness beverages showed off the profit scale in the business as it continues to grow and take that share gross profits up 60% and earnings per share more than doubled on revenue growth of 37% and now the revenue growth was a little bit maybe shy and there some concerns about some of the inventory issues with their key partner, Pepsi is their biggest distributor, handles about two-thirds of the distribution here in the United States and it will in North America. Some concerns, some destocking. Meaning that a year ago they ramped up some of the stocking and into the fourth quarter and now they're not building out those inventories as much and maybe that's going to slow a little bit of the growth. I think that all washes out overall they've a very strong partnership with Pepsi as its largest distributor deal. Dylan, Celsius represented 47% of all growth of the category during the quarter. That's up from 31% last year and up from 22% the year before. The energy and fitness health beverage market is continuing to grow and really Celsius is the big driver of that. Gross margins moved up 7.4% points, 740 basis points to 51.2%. Now mostly on lower freight and raw material costs. They don't think that's a trend that they can bake into their forecast and they're not. They still think they're going to be lower than that but still very impressive. They're going to have little bit higher promotional period during the summer, that's their big period and that obviously helped operating margins. They've 3,000 now branded coolers with Pepsi partnership and their kids unit build that out. Everything is going quite well for Celsius and clearly it showed in the stock over the past year-and-a-half."", ""Dylan Lewis: This is one of those companies where if you don't know them. I would say take a stroll down the drink aisle at your supermarket and find them because they are continuing to grow. They're continuing to show up and that is advice if you are in the United States. One of the things I wanted to tap into with this is 95% of the revenue for Celsius coming from the U.S. Of A. How are you thinking about the international opportunity for them?"", ""Andy Cross: It's great, when you think about the international expansion, they are now in Jim's in the UK and Ireland. Celsius has a lot of business with tied to Jim's, that's how they got their start and they're rolling out in Australia, New Zealand and France later this year. The international market has a really big opportunity for Celsius."", 'Ron Gross: Is this whole category just about branding? Is there anything different or proprietary or unique about the different brands?', ""Andy Cross: Very quickly, if you open up a Celsius can, which I have here and just look at the ingredients, they are much different than what you may find in the others and they built their brand and the existent around the fitness market and the fitness world. That's the big difference than compared to the other energy companies in the space."", 'Dylan Lewis: Most importantly, Andy, how does it taste?', ""Andy Cross: It tastes not bad. I'm not a huge energy drink. I got these for research and now I'm just like tastes and some."", 'Dylan Lewis: We appreciate you going out into the field.', 'Andy Cross: [laughs] Thank you.', ""Dylan Lewis: Andy Cross, Ron Gross, guys, we're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show up next, we've got Foolish advice for college grads. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. It's earnings season, but it's also graduation season. Around the country, students are donning their caps and gowns. This week we went into the Vault for Foolish advice for college grads. My colleague Mary Long gets some timeless guidance from Motley Fool Co-Founder David Gardner about the merits of time-traveling, advice for his past self, and a gentle reminder that if you're collecting a diploma this year, you're part of the smartest generation ever born."", ""David Gardner: Wherever you are as you graduate, ask yourself, where are the bleeding edges of new technology in our society, in our culture. It almost doesn't matter what job you do. I would get to a company that's working in that space. So for example, genomics, that's an exciting area. I'm an English major, but I would be telling myself, just go answer phones over there at the genomics company or if you're a product manager, project manager, those kinds of experiences can be taken to any one of a whole bunch of different organizations. I would really focus on where is the future and be there today."", ""Mary Long: If you're trying to get to the future which you give yourself any stock advice or is that insider trading if you go back to talk to your younger self?"", ""David Gardner: I think first of all, that it should not be considered insider trading. I definitely would give myself a few stock tips. Let's be clear. Time travel clearly has not been invented because no one has been passing through our time as far as I can tell or any other time. If it was invented in the future, we'd know it by now."", ""Mary Long: When you're starting out in a job in, in your career, you're young and ambitious. What's the difference between being a rule-breaker and more of a bridge burner?"", ""David Gardner: Well, first of all, a bridge burner to me implies that you are just thinking mainly about your own career. If things don't work, you're just going to burn that bridge and move on. I hope you wouldn't burn the people that you leave behind you. I think even if in our early jobs we don't stay very long as we get to know ourselves what the world wants from us, I hope we're building good relationships with people all the way through. But I think part of being a rule breaker is that you are realizing it's not about you. It's actually about the rules that are being broken. It's about what's happening in our society in a good way that you can contribute to. I know a lot of people, especially younger people were hearing, have not been as positive. Understandably, we had our college interrupted by COVID, not as bright eyed and bushy tailed as maybe graduates of the past, but that's very temporary. I think more than anything, the key to happiness and thriving is when you feel like you are aligned with a purpose in the organization for profit or not-for-profit that you're working for that fits who you are, that you're excited to get out of bed each day to go to work. That's such a good indicator."", ""Mary Long: It's no secret that you're a die hard optimist. What's your advice to someone who's graduated or is about to graduate and they're feeling down and out? Maybe it's because they are struggling to find a job or they know where they want to be, but are afraid that that job might be replaced by ChatGPT. Or they're just scared of leaving the structure of academia."", ""David Gardner: Well, I have two thoughts for anybody who is feeling a little down and out. The first is if that's tied to loneliness, and I could easily understand that, in fact, the surgeon general's said earlier this month that there's an epidemic in America. It's not cigarettes anymore, it's not three packs a day. That was an earlier era. It's loneliness. So if you are down and out, that might well be part of how you're feeling. What I would say to then is, let's make sure we're getting out and connecting and building friendships. It helps a lot if you do have a job and you meet somebody who cares about you at work, your boss, or somebody older than you, really value those relationships and look for those relationships. But of course, your friends from college or making friends at work, making an effort, even if you're in a hybrid or remote work situation to get to know people, even if you're working at a hybrid company, you can still have coffee with people. You can still go out to happy hour. So I think loneliness is a big problem right now. I really just think the antidote is obvious. Spend more time with others face-to-face. On the other hand, if it's not loneliness, it's just a sense of not knowing what you want to do. I would say that this is the smartest generation ever born. Part of how smart younger people are these days is they're so caring about what they want to spend their lives on. The degree of angst felt by many in terms of what job you take and what that says about who you are or how you're spending the precious time we have on this earth. I think there's one aspect of it that can be a little bit over weaning, that we might be overthinking things sometimes and just get out there get your feet wet, get active. Again, meet people."", 'Mary Long: Yeah. You kind of started to touch on this just in pushing the idea of meeting people, even in a virtual first-world. But beyond like friendships at work, how would you suggest someone like a young person go about finding a mentor in the virtual first-world?', ""David Gardner: Well, I think that for me a lot of it is either going to come from new relationships that you have. Virtual first still means real second, I think. I prefer virtual second and real first, I think that's going to be the healthiest version of me and for most people. But if you do find yourself in a truly a virtual first environment then you either have two choices finding a mentor. The first is finding somebody new in that virtual or real environment. But the second is, if you're somewhere around 21 years of age, you have 21 years of relationships that you've built up. I bet there are already people, school teachers, someone from church, somebody from a past summer job, parent's friends, uncles, aunts. There are lots of opportunities for us to get to spend time. If you feel that you want to with somebody who has some wisdom for you. I would say, try to seek out people who have a genuine interest in you. That's easy to assume from family members or from past coaches, let's say. But if you're talking about new relationships, makes sure that this is somebody that you trust is really thinking about your best version of yourself. That's easier said than done. But I think that's really important that best mentors are going to be people who really want the best for us on our terms, not on theirs."", ""Mary Long: Any parting advice for someone who's just recently graduated?"", ""David Gardner: One other bit of advice that occurs to me is my experience with my first job and that is I quit it within about four months of getting it. In a lot of ways as sort of the oldest child in my family and the classic duty-bound elder child, I thought this is not what I should be doing. You shouldn't be taking a job and then not even nailing down your first year at that come and that's not going to look good on your resume. The punch line is, I had to help start a company instead of getting hired by anybody else's at that point. But I will say it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. After four months, I just let my employer know. It didn't feel like it was for me. I didn't really like the office culture very much. I didn't talk about that with them, but I just realized it was a creatively deadening job. I sometimes asked myself, had I decided I should give it the old college, try and stay there a minimum of two years, etc., I might've missed ever helping start the Motley Fool."", ""Dylan Lewis: If David didn't leave his first job, I wouldn't have mine. So for Fools everywhere, I'm happy things in workout with that first job out of school and he went on to start the Motley Fool. We're heading to break but stick around up next on Motley Fool Money. We've got stocks on our radar."", ""As always, people on the program may have an interest in the stocks they talk about. The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis joined again by Andy Cross and Ron Gross. We've got radar stocks coming up in a minute. But first, a little buy, sell, hold. I've got a couple of stories to round out the week. Andy and Ron, I want your take first one up. It's going to get a little bit more expensive to get into the Judgment-Free Zone. Planet Fitness, raising the cost of its legendarily cheap classic membership from $10 to $15 for new members this summer. Andy, buy, sell, hold the price hike for Planet Fitness."", ""Andy Cross: I wonder if that's because they're putting all the Celsius' into Planet Fitness now, I don't know Celsius actually in Planet Fitness. I think it's a good move. Costs are definitely going up. Now the question is whether their clients are going to be able to continue to afford that and willing to pay that. That's been iconic at 10 bucks and they talk about that. Definitely a change, but if they're making some investments, if you just look at on a percentage basis, Dylan. But if my math is right, that's a huge percentage increase from $10."", ""Dylan Lewis: I think it's about a 50% increase."", 'Andy Cross: That math balance out, almost exactly rounded to the nearest dollar. [laughs]', 'Dylan Lewis: Ron buy, sell, hold the price hike. I want to say, I think this is one where they are right there with Costco in terms of the hotdog being the same price. Now Costco might be the last vestige of pricing permanence.', ""Ron Gross: I'm buy, not a sell here. I think even though it is 50%, it's a reasonable hike after 26 years. I do think most of the client base, if not all the client base will be able to swing it. It is still a relatively good deal. But this is where we'll find out what pricing power they have. I think it's going to work out for them. I don't think it's dramatic enough to anger anybody or to make it a stretch for anyone. But time will tell."", ""Dylan Lewis: For what it's worth, the market slightly cheering this one shares up 3% on the news. I think like cautiously optimistic about the price hikes. Our next buy, sell, hold. If you are a fan of Sriracha, you might want to stock up, reports out that the manufacturer needs to stop production for several months because they're pepper supply is was too green and it would be affecting the color of their iconic sauce. Andy, buy, sell, hold Sriracha as the best condiment on the market."", ""Andy Cross: Oh, I'm going to sell that. I've never been a big Sriracha fan, got a bottle of it in the refrigerator, we never really use it. I love hot sauce but I don't really consider Sriracha that kind of a hot sauce, saying they're better brands out there. If it goes away for a few months it's not going to hurt me, but maybe some other people will be hurt, but I'm calling that a sell."", ""Dylan Lewis: For what it's worth, I am a Cholula guy when it comes to hot sauce and a Ketchup or a Chick-fil-A sauce guy when it comes to pure condiments. Ron, what about you?"", ""Ron Gross: Cholula for sure, I think of Sriracha has being different, more of a condiment Ketchupy kind of a thing. This has happened before and it created this great buzz like we're talking about it right here. But I wonder if there's a little bit of happiness behind the buzz that creates and allows them to charge more to. There was a while back, you had to pay $100 for a bottle on eBay if you really wanted it. It'll be interesting to see if other manufacturers of similar condiments take the same tact and have trouble, or are they going to gain a little market share for the time being. If the actual brand name, Sriracha, that were mostly used through the iconic rooster on the bottle. I believe. I think it's going to all be fine so we can buy this."", ""Andy Cross: It's interesting, you are seeing a lot of these raw material cost, cocoa, going into the chocolate and talking this about Hershey's, it does impact how companies do you think about their pricing. You can't fault the makers of Sriracha for thinking about this if the lack of peppers is leading to increasing costs for them to try to get some of that money back. We are seeing that more and more with some CPG companies."", ""Dylan Lewis: Can I be honest? I love seeing a company insist on quality and maintaining what they're trying to do even at the expense of availability. I think it's always worth it. Our final story for buy-sell-hold, selling a little bit more focused on the big picture, fresh jobs data out showing first-time applications for unemployment benefits are up this week to the highest level in almost a year. Pair that with April job additions coming in a little bit below expectations. Ron, buy, sell, hold the strong labor market we've been seeing for the past few years."", ""Ron Gross: I'm OK with this, so I'm still buying. It's a game of be careful what you wish for. The Fed has been trying to slow the economy, the labor market has been persistently strong, and the people who are saying interest rates will never come down as long as the labor market remains this strong. Here we are with some cracks in the labor market and everybody is now, of course, worried about recession. Its soft landings are hard to manipulate them, maneuver through. I think we still got a shot at it."", 'Dylan Lewis: Andy, what do you think?', ""Andy Cross: Uncle Jay Powell from the Fed is basically said they're trying to slow the labor market. For them any small increase like this is a win. I do think we're going to see some further cracks over the next year-and-a-half. We're just going to have to do with some of the slowing economic activity. But hopefully it's done in a way that doesn't disrupt complete consumer activity. That's a big thing we got to watch."", 'Dylan Lewis: As you guys are seeing headlines related to this, not hitting the panic meter, necessarily this is somewhat within the bounds of what you guys are expecting to see.', 'Ron Gross: Could lead to lower interest rates down the road, which the markets would probably applaud.', ""Dylan Lewis: Let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our man behind-the-glass, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question. Andy, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?"", ""Andy Cross: Fools? I'm looking at Trex, symbol TREX, the number one seller of eco-friendly composite outdoor decks. Maybe you all have it in the back of your house, is back with an outstanding recent quarter that included revenue growth of more than 50%. The market remains really attractive with some 50 million US decks or so beyond the age of replacement, according to the company, it has great relationships with the contractors and professional builders. Ninety-five percent of the decks it makes our from recycled materials, and 100% of those products are made in the US. They have great relationships to be able to manage the recycled material. They have recycling centers that help take plastic bags and all different kinds of junk and turn it into some of these composite decks. The company and the stock goes through these cycles as building activity goes. But with more of a stain, our houses longer remodels continue to be an attractive market for Trex. The returns on capital for this business are north of 20%, with really an outstanding margin profile and the stock sells for around 40 times earnings for a company that I think can grow probably in 10%-15% range for the next few years, and stocks around 88, I think of a dips into like the low 80s, 70s then I think gets really attractive."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Trex.', ""Dan Boyd: Not really a question Dylan, more of a pair of comments, let's be honest. One, I have a Trex porch, nice screened in porch in my backyard, it is pretty fantastic, I'm a fan. I'm a customer of Trex, not a shareholder yet, but definitely a customer. Also, Trex is a Virginia company based in Winchester, Virginia. As a native Virginian, who Andy, you know I like that."", ""Andy Cross: Bryan Fairbanks who's the CEO and we've had come to speak at the Fool. He's very humble, I think, and just continues to run that business. Like I said, it goes through these cycles, but right now, coming out of a very rough 2020 and 2023, things are looking brighter for Trex."", ""Dylan Lewis: I will say I have a wood deck and having just pressure washed and resale, that wood deck. I really wish it was a Trex deck. Unfortunately the deck is too new to make that change, so I'm just living with that. But if you're in a position where you can make that change much easier maintenance, maybe worth the upfront cost to go with Trex. Ron, what are you looking at? What's on your radar this week?"", ""Ron Gross: I think Andy follows this one a little bit too. I'm looking at Toast, T-O-A-S-T. Helps restaurant owners simplify their business. It's software platform provides held with digital orders, delivery, menu management, point-of-sale operations, scheduling, marketing. It's a full-service application. It's good for sit down restaurants, takeouts, drive through delivery. They sell hardware which includes point-of-sale systems, self-ordering kiosks, handheld order taking tablets. They sell those at a loss. They make money by selling software subscriptions and financial technology solutions where they take a small slice of every transaction that they help facilitate. Results earlier this week were pretty strong, 6,000 net new locations in the first-quarter, annualized recurring run rate that they keep an eye on called ARR in their lingo up 32%, they're making progress on getting the profitability the net loss was only, I say only, $83 million for the quarter adjusted EBITDA was positive at $57 million. If you recall back in the September 2021 is when they went public, $40 a share stock surged by 50% on the first day, stocks sedans only now at $27. Down from the IPO, and certainly that first day has a $15 billion market cap. Hard to model this one since it's still very new, but they are doing well. They're on the right track and they're putting up strong results."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question or perhaps a comment on Toast.', ""Dan Boyd: Oh, this one's interesting because the people who interact with it most aren't really the customers, I guess, as restaurants are the customers have Toast. But as somebody who makes online orders, I'm forced to interact with Toast, maybe not the regular, but every now and again. The stock chart does not look very good, Ron, when you zoom out to the max, it looks pretty painful, but you're right in that it is a young company. I feel like ordering online is not going anywhere and it might be better to get in on the ground floor or maybe here on the first floor. But this one seems like from a consumer standpoint, it seems like I'm forced to deal with Toast, not necessarily want to."", ""Ron Gross: The company probably went out at a valuation that was little bit elevated, which you can't fault them for going out at the valuation as high as they can get it. But that was probably some expectations built in there. It's come back down to earth. More reasonable price."", 'Dylan Lewis: More reasonable price. Dan, does that sound interesting for putting it on your watchlist or you thinking Trex?', ""Dan Boyd: I mean, honestly it does sound interesting. However, I'm going to go with my home state and with the product they're already owned. Let's go Trex."", ""Dylan Lewis: Can't argue with that. Since we have a couple of extra seconds, Dan, favorite condiment, is it Sriracha or is it something else?"", 'Dan Boyd: Oh man, Sriracha is pretty good, but I like a spicy mail.', ""Dylan Lewis: Sriracha is an ingredient in spicy mail if you want it to be. Dan Boyd, thanks for weighing in on our radar stocks. Andy and Ron, thanks for bringing them. That's can do it for this week's Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Dylan Lewis. Thanks for listening.

You're listening to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ricky Mulvey joined today by Jason Moser. Jason, thanks for being here."", 'Jason Moser: Happy to be here as always, Ricky. Thanks for having me.', ""Ricky Mulvey: We got Disney earnings today that's topic A. Are you a Disney adult? Would you define yourself? How much does Disney mean to your being and personality?"", ""Jason Moser: No. I wouldn't call myself a Disney adult. But I will say I've been there several times throughout my life as a kid, as a parent. It's weird to say that it really actually was always more fun going as a parent. You're watching the fun that your kids have. That's just priceless. Those are memories; you can't buy those. Well, you can actually."", ""Ricky Mulvey: You literally can buy the memories and we're going to see that show up in the operating income. The headline of the quarter for Disney, JMo, is that parks might be slowing down a little bit, but streaming is becoming profitable in one very specific metric that Bob Iger highlighted. What's your big headline for this quarter?"", ""Jason Moser: To me, it feels Disney is on the right path. They still have an Iger problem they need to figure out because at some point or another and we saw this with Starbucks last week. Starbucks with the Schultz problem, Disney with an Iger problem. At some point, they need to address this and figure out who is going to be the successor to take this company into the next decade and beyond? That question is still outstanding. But the company, they reported encouraging results. Adjusted earnings per share up 30% from a year ago. They actually raised full-year adjusted earnings-per-share growth to 25%. That's versus around 20% quoted last quarter. That's encouraging. With Disney right now, the Disney we all know is the parks and stuff like that. But really the story for investors has been streaming and entertainment. It does feel they're making a lot of progress right there. When you look at the Disney+ cores up, that was up 6%. The subscribers were in ARPU. That average revenue per user metric was also up 6%. Thanks in part 2 some modest price increases. I thought encouragingly, they ended the quarter with 22.5 million ad tier subscribers globally. We know that ad tier is going to be an important component to that strategy. That's something that they need to continue to exploit because the ad tier subscriber is a very profitable one. It's one where they can make a lot of money for that company. It feels they're making the right moves or doing the right things. But this is clearly still a story. Disney loves stories. This is a story that is still being written and we just don't know the end yet."", 'Ricky Mulvey: The story that Iger wants to talk about right now is streaming. Twelve mentions, I think of streaming in his prepared remarks, no mention of succession. But Iger expects the whole unit to be profitable in the last quarter of this year. Right now, the entertainment side is profitable but the sports side is not. Does the story change for Disney if they follow through on this? Streaming as whole is a profitable business for Disney.', ""Jason Moser: I think it does. Success on that front shows that they've made the right strategic decisions. It's one of those things where they were just late to the game and getting it right. We saw the signs of streaming and where entertainment was headed many years back. Because Netflix basically blazed this trail. Better late than never like they say. I'm glad to see that Disney really made the focus or have the focus to make this pivot into going into the streaming realm. But it's very difficult. I think one of the problems that Disney is going to face, and this is a little bit different than what something like a Netflix might have to deal with. It's complicated because Disney has so many properties. When you're talking about Disney, the core Disney content. That Disney Plus thing. But then you've got Hulu, you've got ESPN. There are a lot of pieces to this puzzle and figuring out a way to put them together so that consumers understand what they're getting. That there's a value proposition there that I don't think they quite solved yet. That to me is one of the things to keep an eye on because we use a lot of their services here in our house. I think a lot of people feel the same way. It's difficult to figure out exactly how to access all of it, trying to figure out exactly what you're getting for your money. That's something they need to really focus on I think."", ""Ricky Mulvey: How's this for ESPN? Because I think there's going to be a lot of confusion around ESPN, which is going to have a stand-alone app in the fall of 2025. This is one that does not require a cable subscription. You also have ESPN Proper, which you can watch on TV. I have an ESPN app with ESPN+, I don't know how that works in. ESPN is also going to get a streaming title on Disney Plus. Also, you might have a sports bundle with ESPN included with Fox Sports and maybe all of these other companies. You'd like to see a little bit more of a straightforward strategy here I think."", ""Jason Moser: I agree and I think that's a big point of focus that management really is going to have to hop in on there. It's something they're going to have to navigate. It's a confusing experience at this point. We have ESPN as well, but I'm not exactly sure what ESPN we have or how we get it. For example, in our household, we subscribe to Hulu Live because we'd like to have all of the live TV stuff. It's a cable light offering and we get ESPN through that. But then there's also an ESPN+ feature to the app that we have and we can access that. But I'll tell you, signing in from the phone and then signing into your TV. It's not the most frictionless experience I'll put it that way. When you look at ESPN as a whole, it's still a very powerful brand in sports. But the cost continue to weigh on the business. Paying for that content, that just gets more and more expensive. We're seeing this going through with the NBA deals they're trying to cut and trying to figure out exactly what content they're going to have to offer their consumers going forward. I think at the end of the day, granted, it's a lot of properties and a lot of different ways to get them. It can be a little bit confusing. At the end of the day, I think that's what you want. You want access to all of that stuff, but you need to think about how you're going to deliver it. Going back to Netflix, I think that's what has made Netflix so successful here in this space is they kept it so simple. I don't think you can say the same thing for Disney at this point. Hopefully, that's going to be a big point of focus for them going forward is how can we simplify this and make it obvious the value proposition that we're presenting to consumers, because right now it's just not so obvious."", ""Ricky Mulvey: What do you think about the capital allocation story? Dividends coming back and also in this quarter, Disney repurchased a billion dollars worth of stock, which is a lot, that's a lot of money."", ""Jason Moser: It is. It is a lot of money and it's a business they are projecting. I think what they said, $8 billion in free cash flow here for the full year which is encouraging. I like to see the fact that they're repurchasing shares, particular because they used a lot of those shares to make some of these acquisitions. Fox. But I think that with Disney, reinstituting that dividend made a big difference. That was something I felt like they needed to do way earlier, but again, better late than never good to see they did it. But I think for a long time, a lot of investors just felt this was one of those Holdings that you could tuck away in your portfolio, not worry too much. There's some income coming in through the dividend stream. That got cut off for a little while. It's good to see that it's come back. I do believe that with this business, the size that it is, and what they do, they would be well-served to really focus on figuring out how to make sure to continue that narrative of returning value to shareholders. Share repurchases are fine. You got to figure this is probably a company that is going to make some acquisitions again going forward as we see this entertainment space consolidate. I think really focusing on that dividend could, could be a real positive for, for them and for investors in the coming years. But again, I guess we're going to have to wait and see because they're going to have to invest a lot of money in the streaming endeavor for some time to come."", 'Ricky Mulvey: The big part of the business that makes operating income, most of the operating income comes from the parks, and it seems like that may be facing a headwind. ""We\'re seeing some evidence of a global moderation from peak post-COVID travel."" But it\'s also got expansion plans moving forward at Disneyland. Is the growth story changing for Disney? Is fewer people want to put on those mouse ears and get to the parks or am I concern trolling?', ""Jason Moser: No, I think that the parks business ebbs and flows. It goes with general economic conditions. Right now we're seeing myriad signs that consumers are feeling stretched. We saw in the call there, Disneyland, they said, despite growing attendance and per capita spend, the results actually declined year-over-year due to what they said, cost inflation, including higher labor expenses. The parks business is something that ebbs and flows as economic conditions go. But the nice thing, the good thing, the positive for investors is that the parks business is just so darn difficult to replicate. You can't go out there, just build what they've built and I think that's a tremendous installed base that will serve the company very well. Sometimes you just got to get to take the bad with the good. Right now it's probably going through a little bit of a tough stretch just because of where the consumer is. But the good news is when the consumer recovers and when things start to improve, those parks are still going to be there and will likely continue to just mint cash. Because once you get inside those gates, it seems like your brain just shuts off and you're going to pay whatever you want, whatever you can, even whatever you can't, because you almost have a hard time justifying whether you will ever be able to go there again. I think that's really the power in that parks business. That to me, is a big part of the longer-term investment thesis with this business."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I'm going to LA in a few weeks and I was looking at going to Disneyland. It's going to be 500 bucks about just to get in the door for two people. I'll say, I'll let them save that magic for some other people and I will see you at Knott's Berry Farm, Jason Moser. Let's move on to Axon. I don't think we need to intro Disney, that one's fairly well-known. But for some setup on Axon, the company does tasers, cloud services for the equipment and police/security databases. They also do a mix of training solutions, think virtual reality for real life situations. But the real business growth for this story, for this company is the Cloud and services division, which hit 176 million for the quarter that is up more than 50% year-over-year. What's happening at Axon?"", ""Jason Moser: This company is a great example of monetizing and installed hardware base with more services, software features, etc. Subscription bundles now account for 90% of the company's overall revenue. They have customer relationships with more than 17,000 public safety agencies globally. The nice thing about this business is that that customer base is expanding well beyond just public safety agencies. You're talking about everything from emergency services to law firms that are seeing the benefits of using Axon services. When you think about this business, just general, the thesis is pretty clear. Public safety is a need that societies around the world will continue to prioritize, and Axon really is at the forefront of innovative solutions in that regard. You have to respect the company's mission. The company's mission is to protect life. They're trying to figure out ways for public safety and their customers in the ancillary markets, they want to figure out ways for those customers to be able to protect themselves without necessarily costing life. I think a lot of people would feel very good about that. With Axon again, it goes back to, they built this tremendous hardware product in their cameras and their tasers. What that does, it builds this long term relationship with their customers, where the customers that use that hardware continue to benefit from the software and that software just continues to build more and more data, which allows those agencies to become smarter and make better decisions. It's just a virtuous cycle that keeps on going on and the best part about it is, I guess I should probably say today, there's no real Coke to their Pepsi, but there's no real competitor out there that's doing what they're doing. I think for Axon, they just continue to do what they know how to do best and it's working out for them."", ""Ricky Mulvey: There's also a very specific AI story here, I would say. CEO Rick Smith saying, officers spend about 40% of their time logging reports doing what is essentially data entry. We're going to minimize that so you can spend more time in the field. From the outside, this seems like the AI story you'd like to see, which is we have a very specific solution that we think we have an application for."", 'Jason Moser: I think you hit the nail on the head there. This is one of those AI stories that is a bit more understandable and obvious. I think this is a really exciting development for the company. They\'ve introduced this new product or this new service called Draft One, which is ultimately it\'s software product that utilizes generative AI to draft what they call high-quality police reports based on the auto transcribed, body-worn camera audio. We talk about AI and all the things AI can do and whatnot. Some of it makes a lot of sense, a lot of it doesn\'t. A lot of it really requires you to make this big leap in a saying, well, I see where maybe this could work out in the future. But with Axon, I can really see how this is working out well now. It was really interesting to see their shareholder letter for the quarter, they had some quotes from from some of the police forces that have started utilizing this service Draft One. One of the quotes said, and I quote, ""With over 27 years of experience in law enforcement, I have seen technology come and go, but Draft One is the most exciting innovations for law enforcement I\'ve ever seen."" Another quote said, ""Draft One is the next evolution in report writing as significant as when law enforcement moved from the typewriter to the Word processor."" This to me, it does feel like you understand the value proposition that AI can bring when the officers or the customers that are using this technology. It\'s saving them immense amounts of time to get on record the facts of the matter. I think this is really what it boils down to for Axon and what they\'re trying to do. They\'re trying to give us reality, trying to give us objective information, these are the facts of the matter. For Axon, a product like Draft One, this is a new offering. It\'s just getting started. I really feel like this has a lot of room to run, particularly when you consider how strong this business is on that recurring revenue front.', ""Ricky Mulvey: Before we wrap up, Axon also announced it will acquire Dedrone or drones as a first responder. This is a company that's showing a lot of growth, but investors expect a lot of growth out of Axon. We don't know what the price tag for Dedrone, which I guess they're still in talks for it maybe I don't know why they did that, but are you buying that as a growth engine?"", ""Jason Moser: I am. To me, I love Axon, I've recommended it a number of times in multiple services. I own the stock personally. I think there's a tremendous future for this business and so I'm happy to see them doing things like this. They do have a history of little bolt-on acquisitions in order to expand their market opportunity. I think the question really is, with this business, do they need to keep making these little acquisitions in order to expand that market opportunity? Because at some point that market opportunity caps out. But when you consider the acquisition of Dedrone today, Axon says this is going to expand their total addressable market from $50 billion to $77 billion. Now, when you put that in the context of a business like Axon, which is bringing in like $2 billion a year revenue right now, that's very meaningful. It shows you all of the opportunity there. But it's a little bit of a pivot away from what they do in regard to things like tasers and in working with police forces directly in regard to the software and things like Draft One and whatnot. But it's a new day and age. Technology moves fast and drones are not going away. The Dedrone acquisition is a focus on that counter drone market opportunity; drones being used for the purpose of bad. Axon wants to figure out a way to help police that. We don't know the terms of the deal, of course. I can't imagine they paid more than it was really more of, Axon has a good history of making smart acquisitions. I'd like to believe this will be another one of those, but that's definitely something to keep an eye on."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Jason Moser, I appreciate your time and insight.', 'Jason Moser: Thank you.', ""Ricky Mulvey: Ricky Mulvey, with Motley Fool Money here, to tell you about a vehicle that is redefining sporting luxury, the Range Rover Sport. The first thing I noticed when I sat down in the driver's seat that I felt like I was in a cockpit, up off the ground in a focused interior that promotes exhilarating driver engagement. I also really appreciated the overhead 360-degree camera view that let me know exactly where I was going as I was backing out of the parking space. I went for a drive in the Range Rover Sport out in Littleton, Colorado, tested the accelerator just a little bit and felt the performance and agility. It's an instinctive drive with engaging on-road dynamics and effortless composure. To put it plainly, the Range Rover Sport is powerful. It's also quiet and comfortable. Advanced cabin technologies such as active noise cancellation and cabin air purification, offer new levels of comfort and refinement. The third-generation Range Rover Sport is the most desirable and advanced and dynamically capable yet. I'd like to invite you to visit landroverusa.com to learn more about the Range Rover Sport, I'm sure you've heard of the 60-40 portfolio. But who does it make sense for? Does it still make sense? Allison Southwick and Robert Brokamp look into this popular portfolio allocation."", ""Alison Southwick: How much you invest in the stock market and how much you keep out will be one of the most important decisions you make about your portfolio. Over the years, some guidelines have emerged to help such as don't put any money you need in the next few years in stocks or 100 minus your age is the percentage you should invest in stocks but there's one asset allocation that is not only a rule of thumb but also the basis for how hundreds of billions of dollars are invested and that is the 60/40 portfolio. It's the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup of portfolio management, a mix of two popular investments that tastes great together or at least has stood the test of time. That's sad though. It's been a rough few years for the 60/40 which has led investors to question whether the correct ratio of chocolate to peanut butter, I mean stocks to bonds. Well anyway, Bro let's get started by giving the basics of the 60/40 portfolio."", ""Robert Brokamp: Yes, Allison, the basic version is that it's 60% stocks, 40% bonds and it's essentially a balanced portfolio of offense and defense with a tilt toward the more aggressive investments. In fact, mutual funds that invest along these lines have come to be known as balanced funds. Now when you take a look at these funds or anyone else who's closely trying to file this type of portfolio, you'll find that some are 50-55% stocks, others are 65%-70% stocks, so it's often not exactly 60/40 but there will be some regular rebalancing so the portfolio doesn't become too over-weighted in one single type of investment. You'll find there's a lot of diversification within the stock side as well as the bond side. You won't find a balanced fund that's just invested in tech stocks and that 40% allocation to bonds usually has all kinds of bonds and usually involves some cash. The foundation of the 60/40 is diversification, usually with a nod to the fact that stocks have outperformed bonds over the long term."", 'Alison Southwick: That 60/40 portfolio has been around for decades. Do we know where it came from?', 'Robert Brokamp: If you try to reassert the origins of the 60/40 portfolio, you\'ll find all kinds of theories about who came up with it. But the truth is, no one knows. What I think is funny given how important it\'s become Dr. Steve Foerster, who is a professor at the Ivey Business School in Ontario and the co-author of In Pursuit of the Perfect Portfolio, published a very thorough article on Medium, chronicling his quest for the origins of the 60/40 and he tracked down anything you could find. He looked through old publications and he spoke with several people including luminaries like Nobel Prize winner Bill Sharpe and he basically concluded that if you look back as far as the 1930s, diversified portfolios managed by big institutions had more of a 50-50 split but then came the 1950s, which was an excellent decade for stocks with US large-caps earning almost 20% a year on average and that led more investors to tend to overweight stocks from that out. As Foerster wrote, ""based on my quest, I can say with a high degree of confidence that the 60/40 portfolio most likely originated in the early 1960s, wasn\'t based on a magical optimizer formula but it made intuitive sense"".', ""Alison Southwick: It's been around since maybe the 1960s, which was a while ago, so the returns must be pretty good."", 'Robert Brokamp: Well, first of all, I was born in the 1960s.', 'Alison Southwick: I know what I was saying.', ""Robert Brokamp: I was alive for only like five months in the 1960s. But anyways, let's look at the returns here and we're going to turn to Dr. Foerster's article for the returns from 1960-2022. If we had included 2023, it'd be a little higher because that was actually a good year for the 60/40 but let's go with the numbers in his article and over that period, the S&P 500 returned 10.1% on average each year. That's right in line with what we've always heard, stocks returned 10% over the long term. How much does that return drop if you move to 60% S&P 500 and 40% in a mix of 10-year treasuries and corporate bonds? It goes from 10.1% to just 9% a year on average. But what you get is a portfolio that is only about 60% as volatile as an all-stock portfolio as measured by standard deviation. If you look at the returns of stocks and bonds since 1960, there have been 14 down years for the S&P 500 but in nine of those years, bonds made money, so they counterbalanced the loss. In five, bonds declined along with stocks but most of those years it was just 1-3%. On the whole and oppressive risk-reward trade-off, the issue nowadays is that bonds are on a historically bad run. Interest rates were driven very low after the Great Recession of 2007, 2009 and then even lower during the pandemic and the best predictor of future bond returns is current rates and sure enough, the returns on bonds over the past several years have just been bad and in 2022, bonds lost around 15% and by some measures, that was the worst year for US bonds in history. Of course, stocks also plummeted that year, making 2022 the worst year for the 60/40 and decades. In fact, you have to go back to the 1930s to find a time when the 60/40 did worse than it did in 2022."", ""Alison Southwick: It makes sense that people have been questioning whether the 60/40 portfolio really works anymore and so a debate that's been going on for actually several years now. Here's some headlines from the past couple of years from Goldman Sachs, is the 60/40 dead? From Investopedia, why a 60/40 portfolio is no longer good enough? From Kiplinger's, the 60/40 portfolio is dead, long live 33. It sounds like people think we can do better than 60/40."", ""Robert Brokamp: The disappointment over the last few years really does come from being burned by bonds. They lost money in 2018, 2021, 22 and they're down so far this year. What critics point out is that both stocks and bonds can struggle during times of rising inflation or rising interest rates, so you may not be getting as much diversification as you think you're getting and some will also point out that except for 2022, the 60/40 did pretty well in the recent past but mostly thanks to outstanding stock returns. But these high returns have led to high valuations, which is just lower future returns. In January took a look at the predictions for various asset classes from 12 big-name firms, so that's Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard and so on and none expect US stocks to return 10% a year over the next decade or so, the predictions ranged from essentially zero return to 7% a year, with the average being around 5%. Of course, no one knows how the stock market will perform but if you place current conditions in a historical context, it's suggests that below-average returns are likely over the next several years. You put pricey stocks with struggling bonds and you can see why some experts believe investors should move beyond the 60/40 by putting some portion of that portfolio in something else."", ""Alison Southwick: On a recent episode, Lawrence McDonald, he's the author of How to Listen When Market Speak, made the case that investors should adjust for a sustained period of high inflation and that looks like 40% stocks, 40% bonds and 20% commodities. The idea is that the long period of low inflation and low interest rates favored gross stocks, while commodities and commodity stocks often do well during previous periods of high inflation."", ""Robert Brokamp: These days you could read about many proposed tweaks to the 60/40 that entail allocations I think would be broadly considered alternatives and that can include commodities, private equity, hedge funds, directly owned real estate and other investments not commonly held by the individual investor. There might be some merit in these arguments but the challenge is that many of these asset classes are difficult and are expensive for the typical working-class American to invest in. The cream of the crop is, is usually only available to big institutions or really wealthy individuals. Plus these investments are often very illiquid, so you have to hold on for many years to realize the payoff. The one that is most interesting to me is commodities-based companies such as energy companies, materials companies, maybe even real estate in the right location and uses. Certainly worth investigating, if you think inflation is going to be a persistent problem, I'm less excited about individual commodities themselves because they can be very volatile and most investors own them through ETFs that invest in commodities futures and not the commodities themselves, which adds an extra layer of complexity. That said, I do own a bit of gold via the SPDR Gold Shares ETF ticker GLD, which is now trading near all-time highs of around $188. I think it's fine to own some commodities if you've done the research and you understand the investment. But I will point out that the gold ETF was trading a hair under 180, so just a little below where it is today, back in 2011. It's not a great long-term investment yet and unlike many commodities-based companies, gold and other commodities don't pay a dividend while you're waiting for the stock price to eventually go up."", ""Alison Southwick: All right then, judge, Bro. What's your final verdict here? Does the 60/40 portfolio still make sense or is it time to look beyond the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, maybe add some Rice Krispies, some caramel. I don't know."", 'Robert Brokamp: That sounds good.', 'Alison Southwick: I think it might be a little too sweet.', ""Robert Brokamp: Anyway, so conceptually, I think it makes sense for everyone to be thinking in terms of playing mostly offense in their portfolios but also some defense and the right mix of offense is going to vary from person to person. From people who are far from retirement, I think 60/40 is likely playing it too safe. Early this year, I looked at the average allocations of target date funds from the biggest providers. Target-date funds are these asset allocations that are based on when you will retire and the year is usually in the name of the fund. For people who file their retirement, it's very aggressive but they gradually get more conservative as you get closer to the date. The 20/50 funds on average had more than 90% of their assets on stocks and the 20/40 funds had more than 80% in stocks. It was a 20/30 funds that on average had that classic's 60/40 allocation. The funds for those near or in retirement had just 40%-50% in stocks. Which might be a little low for my taste but rather than close with what I think, let's turn to someone who has been erroneously credited with creating the 60/40 portfolio. That person is William Bengen, the father of the original research that established 4% as a safe withdrawal rate in retirement, though he'd nudge that up over the following years after doing additional research closer to maybe 4.5% nowadays. The recent initiative, Jeremy Siegel, stocks for the long run, said that the 60/40 portfolio could be attributed to Bengen's research. I reached out to Mr. Bengen and asked him if he considered himself to be the father of the 60/40 and he said he can't claim credit for it but it does line up pretty closely with his current research, which indicates that at 55%-60% allocation to stocks with regularly balancing is ideal. That's good enough for me to conclude that at least for retirees, a 60/40 portfolio is still a good starting."", ""Ricky Mulvey: As always, people on the program may own stocks mentioned and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.

That’s where dividend stocks come in. These equities accounted for an average of 34% of the market’s total returns from 1940 to 2023 and made significant contributions during decades of high inflation. This shows that building wealth through dividends takes time and patience, so one shouldn’t expect a bountiful harvest overnight.', 'A clear example of the power of dividends can be observed through Warren Buffett’s investment in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Berkshire Hathaway acquired KO shares for $1.3 billion back in 1994 and received $75 million in cash dividends through this investment. In 2023, the dividend amount received by Berkshire had skyrocketed to a staggering $736 million, and it is set to receive $776 million in Coke dividends this year. This highlights the compounding effect of dividends and solid returns they can deliver to long-term investors like Buffett. In addition to compounding benefits, it is worth mentioning that the company has consistently increased its dividends for over six decades. That is why financial experts always advise investing in dividend-growth stocks for long-term gains.', 'Kirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist in the Chief Investment Office for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, spoke about the importance of dividend growth stocks in the firm’s annual report. Here is what she said:', '“Generally, it’s larger, more mature companies that return capital to their shareholders in the form of dividends. Companies that have consistently increased their dividends tend to be more stable, higher-quality businesses, which historically have weathered downturns and are more likely to have the ability to pay dividends consistently.”', 'That said, maintaining dividend growth over time demands financial stability and unwavering commitment. Dividend growth stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 due to their potential for capital appreciation and financial health. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, delivered a 10.68% return to shareholders since its inception in 2005 through 2023, as we reported in our article, 14 Dividend Growth Stocks with Highest Growth Rates, citing data from ProShares.

I will now turn the call over to Luke."", ""Luke Sarsfield: Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. During the first quarter of 2024, P10 generated strong financial results and importantly, advance the strategic initiatives we laid out on our last call in late February. Our strategies continue to perform well, generating strong and consistent returns for our LPs and we raised nearly $670 million in gross new fee-paying AUM in this quarter alone. With Q1 marking my first full quarter as CEO, I can say with conviction that we are building a world-class platform that provides clients with unrivaled access to opportunities across the lower and core middle markets. On our call today, I'm going to provide an overview of our first quarter financial results, offer some perspectives on the market environment and discuss the operational progress we've made this year."", ""I'll start by providing a brief financial overview. P10 delivered record revenues of $66 million in the first quarter, representing solid 15% top line growth year-over-year. Additionally, we enhanced our bottom-line performance, earning $5 million in net income compared to $800,000 in the prior year period. As we mentioned on our last call, one of the key pillars of our new strategy is greater transparency. As such, we believe it is important to introduce new metrics that allow the investment community to more easily compare us to other alternative asset managers. To that end, we delivered Fee-Related Revenue or FRR, of $65 million, a 16% increase compared to the prior year period and we generated approximately $31 million of Fee-Related Earnings, or FRE, a 9% increase from Q1 2023."", 'This represents an FRE margin of 47%. We continue to anticipate margins to remain in the mid-40s for the year ahead which puts this performance slightly ahead of annual expectations. We are pleased with our ability to generate strong results as we implement transformative strategic initiatives that seek to accelerate growth in the near to medium term. Our first quarter performance gives us the confidence to reiterate guidance we laid out on our fourth quarter call. As a reminder, we expect to organically raise and deploy more than $2.5 billion of gross new assets. We expect double-digit revenue growth that is driven both by this fundraising activity as well as positive fee rate dynamics and we expect to announce a strategic transaction in the calendar year.', ""Zooming out slightly, P10 continues to benefit from a focus on the lower and core middle markets. As we have said previously, these markets have been insulated from some of the macro dynamics at the upper middle market levels, such as a meaningfully slower M&A environment, greater reliance on leverage and a more competitive backdrop for deals. In our view, the lower and core middle markets offer risk mitigation from these trends and have equally shown sustained resilience despite the current rate environment and inflationary pressures. Further, our strategies have an exceptional track record of delivering returns across economic cycles. Our GPs are strong fundraisers and even better portfolio managers, whether it's through launching and optimizing industry-leading products or forging strategic relationships with underlying portfolio companies, our strategies have established a differentiated reputation with clients, investment managers and intermediaries."", ""P10's managers have earned trust at every level of the investment value chain and mistrust underpins the strategic initiatives that we laid out on our last call. Today, I want to share some of the progress we've made in driving organic growth initiatives, establishing a robust M&A pipeline and institutionalizing our platform for the long term. First, we are making strides to drive organic growth. We see a clearly and compelling opportunity to deepen and expand our already robust client franchise. In the first quarter, we had 10 co-mingled funds in the market, providing multiple avenues to meet the particular investment objectives of clients and achieve our organic growth goals. I want to take a moment to share some of the momentum we are producing on the fundraising front."", 'In the first quarter, our VC strategy TrueBridge achieved its $750 million target in Fund VIII. Today, the fund is on pace to hold a final close in the second quarter at a total fund size in excess of $850 million. In private credit, Park IV has now achieved over $500 million, surpassing its target and putting it on track to hold the final close in the second quarter. Staying in credit, WTI is positioned to turn on fees for its Fund XI in the second half of the year and we are seeing strong interest around its portfolio. Moving to private equity. Bonaccord will hold a final close of BCP Fund II later in this year and we will look to launch BCP Fund III in short succession. Finally, we expect to launch RCP Direct Fund V in the coming weeks. Further, RCP is on track to launch SOF5, a secondary fund in late 2024 which will set the stage for strong momentum in 2025.', 'These funds have historically garnered a strong following from LPs, not only for their performance but because of the demand for these solutions in the market today. We are pleased with the totality of our fundraising efforts which have resulted in a gross raise of approximately $670 million in the first quarter. Our organic growth will always be enabled by our core strategies and these fundraising levels demonstrate the diversity of demand from our client base. Moving now to our inorganic growth strategy. On our last call, we announced the appointment of Arjay Jensen to our leadership team as Head of Strategy and M&A. Since then, Arjay has been hard at work developing our M&A infrastructure, leading the charge for us on situations that we are working to advance as well as doing the work on opportunities we are seeing in the market.', 'I want to provide a few high-level observations about the level of activity we are seeing. First, I would say the M&A market and the alternative asset management sector has picked up. You see that in the announcements in the marketplace generally and we see it in the number of opportunities we see directly. The pipeline we have developed to date is reasonably balanced between private equity, credit and distribution-oriented opportunities. These are investments that we believe are actionable in the near term and represent a diverse mix from a geographic standpoint across both domestic and international deals. Throughout all our dialogue around prospective transactions, we have received positive feedback from potential partners who find the P10 business model and our transaction framework to be differentiating and compelling.', 'We anticipate announcing a deal this year and I also think it is most likely that near-term successes will be more string of pearls in nature. We continue to think that geographic expansion where we have larger strategies as well as smaller natural adjacencies and potential tuck-ins would make sense. Additionally, we are focused on situations that have an interesting distribution component to them. Please note that we will be disciplined around valuation seeking accretive opportunities positioned to unlock long-term value for our shareholders. Turning now to our focus on optimizing our corporate level organizational structure. As you can see with the traction Arjay has already achieved, our efforts to institutionalize the P10 platform are taking hold.', 'Since our last call, we have made several key appointments, enhanced our governance profile and set ourselves up to conclude our search for senior-level talent in the first half of the year. In April, we appointed Tracey Benford to the Board as an Independent Director who will participate in all 3 of our governance committees. Tracey is a remarkable leader with deep alternative asset expertise and experience stewarding iconic institutions in the financial sector. She brings an independent, diverse perspective to our Board. Robert Alpert informed the Board of Directors of his decision to step down as Executive Chairman effective June 14, the date of our annual meeting. This time as Executive Chairman was intended to help me and our senior team effective successful leadership transition and he now feels that transition is complete.', ""He will continue to serve on the Board as a director. The Board voted to appoint me to the role of Chairman also effective June 14 and intends to appoint a lead independent director at our annual meeting. I want to thank Robert for his time as Executive Chairman and his leadership since founding P10. I look forward to continuing to work with him on the Board. The Board also determined that the company's stockholder rights plan is no longer necessary for the preservation of Federal in impact benefits and voted to terminate the rights plan effective today. The plan was set to expire in October of 2024. In parallel, we are augmenting our management team for future growth. To that end, I am pleased to report that we brought on Melodie Craft as General Counsel to bolster our senior leadership team."", ""Melodie has an impressive long-standing track record as a leader in the financial services sector with alternative asset management expertise and deep experience leading M&A transactions through requisite legal processes and post-close integration activities. Her experience perfectly aligns with our operational goals and will be beneficial to P10 as we embark on our next chapter of growth. While we remain in the early innings of these strategic initiatives, we've been extremely pleased with the partnership we're seeing across strategies and managers. There is immense opportunity in our existing platform and we look forward to sharing specific examples in the coming quarters. I'll close with an update on our efforts to return value to shareholders through capital allocation."", 'Last quarter, we shared that we had a total share repurchase authorization of over $50 million. In the first quarter, we bought back about $3.7 million shares at an average price of $8.15 per share. We currently have approximately $21 million remaining on our authorization. Additionally, we continue to pay quarterly cash dividends to shareholders, declaring a $0.035 distribution today which represents an 8% increase. Our annual dividend now stands at $0.14 per share. As a reminder, P10 employees make up the largest ownership position in our shareholder register which is indicative of our collective conviction in the intrinsic value of our business. This ownership stake demonstrates our alignment with the broader shareholder base and should underscore our dissatisfaction with the current valuation pressure we face in the public market.', 'We have been opportunistic in repurchasing shares of our stock and believe that the current trading levels present a compelling entry point for investors. As our strategy continues to gain momentum, the growth profile of P10 expands and accelerates. We believe the market will appreciate this potential in due time. Fundamentals of our business remain exceptionally strong. We have the right strategy in place to deliver long-term value to shareholders. Before I turn the call over to Amanda, I want to take a moment to invite you all to mark your calendars for our inaugural Investor Day which will be held on Thursday, September 19 in New York City. The day will serve as a deep dive on our various strategies and we will offer more details on our strategic progress to date.', ""We look forward to sharing more details as the event approaches. With that, I'll hand the call over to Amanda."", 'Amanda Coussens: Thank you, Luke. P10 continues to deliver strong results and implementing the transformative strategic initiatives the management team laid out on the fourth quarter earnings call. In the first quarter, fee-paying assets under management were $23.8 billion, a 10% increase on a year-over-year basis. In the first quarter, $667 million of fundraising and capital deployment was offset by $81 million in step downs and expirations. As we mentioned on the Q4 call, we expect step-downs in expirations for 2024 to be approximately $1.5 billion, $200 million less than 2023. Most of the step-downs in expirations will occur in Q2, where we expect $1 billion, leaving $400 million generally evenly split across the third and fourth quarters.', 'Most of the second quarter step-downs in expirations are expected to be attributable to RCP Fund IX, a 2014 vintage and TrueBridge Fund II, a 2010 vintage. Record revenue in the first quarter was $66.1 million, a 15% increase over the first quarter of 2023. Average fee rate in the first quarter was 110 basis points driven by higher fee rate direct strategies becoming a larger part of our key plan AUM mix as well as higher catch-up fees. Turning now to our strategy. In the quarter, we had 10 funds in the market and saw broad participation across our investment platform. Our private equity strategies raised and deployed $213 million, our venture solution raised and deployed $339 million and our credit strategies added $99 million to fee-paying assets under management.', 'Of note in the quarter, TrueBridge raised $233 million. P10 continues to benefit from strategies with long track records of generating durable alpha and offering best-in-class investment opportunities to our global clients. Catch-up fees were $7.7 million in the first quarter. Operating expenses in the first quarter were $54 million, a 3% increase over the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by additional compensation benefits and noncash stock-based compensation expense related to the acquisitions of Bonaccord Park and WTI. GAAP net income in the first quarter was $5.2 million, an increase compared to $800,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $30.8 million, an increase of 9% from the first quarter of 2023.', 'For the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%. For the first quarter, adjusted net income, or ANI, held flat at $25.4 million when compared to the first quarter of 2023. Fully diluted ANI EPS remained at $0.21 per share on a year-over-year basis. As Luke noted, we have added transparency in the quarter and are introducing the following metrics: fee-related revenue or FRR, fee-related earnings, or FRE and complementary FRE margin. FRR in the quarter was $65 million, representing a 16% annual increase and FRE was $30.7 million, representing a 9% increase. Our FRE margin was 47% in the first quarter. Since this is the first time we have reported these metrics, I want to provide more information on how we define each term. Fee-related revenue is calculated as total revenue less any incentive fees.', 'Fee-related earnings is a non-GAAP performance measure used to monitor our baseline earnings less any incentive fee revenue and excluding any incentive fee-related expenses. We believe this additional disclosure will help the investment community draw better apples-to-apples comparison with the broader alternative asset management landscape. You can find additional details and definitions in our earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter were $29 million. At quarter end, we had an outstanding debt balance of $316 million and $45 million available on the revolver. As of today, we have an outstanding debt balance of $298 million and $63 million available on the revolver. We also continue to pay our quarterly dividend for Class A and Class B common stock.', ""As Luke mentioned, we are increasing our dividend by 8%. Today, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.035 per share, payable on June 20, 2024, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 31, 2024. Finally, as of March 31, 2024, our Class A shares outstanding were 54,582,698 and Class B shares outstanding were 58,439,363. Before I close, I'd like to highlight that next week, we expect to file a required registration statement that registers shares owned by founders and insiders. These shares were part of the shares issued during the IPO process. We want to be clear, the company is not selling shares to raise capital with over 3 million shares purchased last quarter, we take management's view on the stock's intrinsic value is clear."", ""Thank you for your time today. We look forward to building strong momentum in 2024 as we seek to accelerate growth in 2025.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI)."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' Check out our latest analysis for United Rentals ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Rentals is:', '31% = US$2.5b ÷ US$8.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.31 in profit."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, United Rentals has a superior ROE than the average (17%) in the Trade Distributors industry."", ""That's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for United Rentals visit our risks dashboard for free."", 'Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.', ""It's worth noting the high use of debt by United Rentals, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.50. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time."", 'Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.', ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

Previously named Gabelli Asset Management Company, it underwent a name change to GAMCO in 2005 under the billionaire's leadership."", ""Recognized as Morningstar's Fund Manager of the Year in 1997 and The Institutional Investor's Money Manager of the Year in 2010, Gabelli is among a group of investors who have embraced value investing principles established by Graham and Dodd while adding their unique approach to the strategy. In Gabelli's case, this involves the perspective of approaching a public company as a potential acquirer. He believes that certain businesses may hold greater value in the private market than as publicly traded entities, making a valuation that appears fair in the markets particularly attractive from a buyer's standpoint. As a result, his investment approach typically emphasizes cash flow over earnings."", 'A figure well-versed to us at Insider Monkey due to our extensive coverage of his investment strategies and stock preferences, Mario Gabelli recently came in the spotlight for his position on Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA). In early April, the company\'s board elected to engage in exclusive merger talks with Skydance, led by CEO David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, favoring the independent studio over Apollo Global Management\'s $26 billion bid. As part of the proposed arrangement, Skydance, recognized for producing Paramount hits like ""Top Gun: Maverick"" would acquire Redstone\'s stake in National Amusements, the privately held entity controlling nearly 80% of Paramount Global\'s voting shares, for approximately $2 billion. Nonetheless, Gabelli voiced his preference for the company to adhere to its current turnaround strategy under Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) president and CEO Bob Bakish. The prominent investor was outspoken in his criticism of the potential merger between Paramount and Skydance Media, advocating for Paramount to withdraw from deal negotiations entirely. Furthermore, in a separate interview, Gabelli, whose firm wields a substantial voting stake in Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) via super voting shares and common stock, reiterated his opposition to a sale to Apollo Global Management as well.', 'However, reports suggest that Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) may still be in negotiations with Skydance, albeit on a non-exclusive basis. Shareholders have grown wary of pursuing the Ellison path, fearing that a deal would disproportionately benefit Redstone to their detriment. To counter this, Skydance recently sweetened the deal by offering a $3 billion cash infusion, which would grant shareholders a larger stake than initially proposed. Meanwhile, the Sony/Apollo bid would result in the film studio becoming the controlling shareholder. Should this occur, industry observers predict that Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) would likely operate as a label within the Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) framework. The Hollywood creative community is apprehensive about this prospect, as it would effectively strip Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) of its autonomy and reduce the pool of studio buyers for filmmakers to pitch their projects to. This would continue a trend that began in 2019 when The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) acquired the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox, reducing the number of autonomous studios to the current count of five.', ""In any case, Mario Gabelli continues to be a prominent figure on Wall Street, renowned for his impressive track record, and given his expertise and success, keeping an eye on his top stock selections is a prudent strategy. Considering these factors, following some of Gabelli's favored stock picks, which include the likes of Deere & Company (NYSE:DE), Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT), and United Rentals, Inc.

I know I certainly won't. The company is the standard bearer for the accelerating adoption of AI thanks to its gold standard AI chips and has thus far been the one undisputed beneficiary of the AI revolution. The stock price has gained more than 200% over the past year alone, led by triple-digit revenue and profit growth in each of the preceding four quarters -- which is memorable, to say the least."", 'That said, some investors are already looking to the next wave of AI adoption as the potential windfall expands beyond Nvidia, as it no doubt will. In fact, analysts are particularly bullish on two semiconductor stocks that provide compelling alternatives for investors looking to expand their exposure beyond Nvidia.', ""While Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) is best known for providing the central processing units (CPUs) that underpin 99% of the world's smartphones, the company's portfolio is much more expansive. Its semiconductors are also staples in personal computers, tablets, smartwatches, networking equipment, and data centers."", ""The accelerating adoption of AI represents the next big opportunity for both Arm and investors, as many of the world's high-end AI processors incorporate Arm's latest technology. Nvidia's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which integrates accelerated CPU and graphics processing unit (GPU) technology to better handle the rigors of AI processing, uses 144 of Arm's version 9 (V9) CPU cores, while Microsoft's data-center chips use more than 100. Furthermore, Arm's customer list includes other well-known players in the AI space, including Advanced Micro Devices and Alphabet's Google, among others."", ""For its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended March 31), Arm delivered record results. Revenue jumped 47% year over year to $928 million, driven by licensing revenue for its AI chips, while its net income of $224 million jumped 74-fold. Evidence suggests its growth spurt will continue as Arm's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- made up of contractually obligated sales that haven't yet been booked as revenue -- rose 45%. Management also boosted its forecast and is now expecting fiscal 2025 Q1 revenue of $900 million at the midpoint of its guidance, though that well may be conservative."", 'Of the 29 analysts who issued an opinion on Arm stock in April, 16 rate it a buy or strong buy, and only one recommends selling, citing short-term valuation.', 'Evercore ISI Group analyst Mark Lipacis is the most bullish among his Wall Street colleagues. He has an outperform (buy) rating and a $145 price target on Arm stock, which suggests 33% upside compared to Friday\'s closing price. The analyst cites the shift to AI, ongoing data-center upgrades, and management\'s ""beat and raise quarter"" as fueling his enthusiasm.', 'If the analyst is right -- and I believe he is -- Arm Holdings gives investors another way to profit from the ongoing adoption of AI.', 'Another company poised to ride the wave of AI higher is Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU). The company is a leading supplier of memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips, which are indispensable for AI processing and data-center operations.', ""Micron's customer list is a Who's Who of the industry's largest chipmakers, including Nvidia, AMD, IBM, and Intel, among many others."", ""The strength of its recent results caught many investors by surprise. For Micron's fiscal 2024 Q2 (ended Feb. 29), the company generated revenue of $5.82 billion, up 58% year over year and 23% quarter over quarter. Furthermore, robust demand drove strong price increases. That demand is expected to accelerate as the year goes on and as management is guiding for revenue of $6.6 billion in Q3, which would represent year-over-year growth of 76%."", 'Micron also noted that its HBM3E high-bandwidth memory supply, which has been adopted by Nvidia for its H200 Tensor Core GPUs, is completely sold out for this year, while much of the 2025 supply is spoken for as well. This helps illustrate the strong and growing demand for AI processors and why Micron is a compelling opportunity.', 'Of the 36 analysts who issued an opinion on Micron stock in April, 30 rate it a buy or strong buy, and not one recommends selling.', 'Baird analyst Tristan Gerra recently raised his rating to outperform (buy) while assigning a $150 price target on Micron stock, which suggests 24% upside compared to Friday\'s closing price. The analyst says he sees ""meaningful upside opportunities,"" citing robust pricing power and strong demand from hyperscale cloud operators as driving ""unprecedented outlook"" over the coming 12 to 18 months.', ""This gives investors another compelling opportunity to ride the secular tailwinds of AI that aren't named Nvidia."", 'Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

But what if you already own enough Nvidia, or are simply looking for other opportunities?', 'A good place to start is by looking at the companies that Nvidia partners with that indirectly benefit from its success.', ""Three that stick out are Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), Vertiv Holdings (NYSE: VRT), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). Here's what makes each stock a great buy now."", ""Scott Levine (Micron Technology): Of the many Nvidia partners that have the potential to prosper from a relationship with the AI juggernaut, Micron is a company that should certainly be on growth investors' radars."", ""A leader in memory and storage solutions, Micron benefited from the AI industry's rapid growth in 2023. Its new partnership with Nvidia suggests that the company is extremely well positioned for future growth as the AI market continues to soar."", 'In February, Micron announced that it had commenced large-scale production of its high capacity memory solution, the High Bandwidth Memory 3E (HBM3E), and it began deliveries of the product in the second quarter. Micron asserts that the HBM3E will help enable ""lightning-fast data access for AI accelerators, supercomputers, and data centers."" Nvidia will use the HBM3E in its graphics processing card (GPU), the H200 Tensor Core GPU. It\'s not only an increase in performance that makes the HBM3E attractive -- it\'s also appealing from an economics perspective. Micron lauds the HBM3E as a more cost-effective option, as it uses 30% less power than similar products.', 'According to Nvidia, the H200 Tensor Core GPU doubles the memory capacity of its previous product, the H100 Tensor Core GPU, and has 1.4 times the bandwidth. With this upgrade in performance, Nvidia is confident that the H200 Tensor Core GPU will further facilitate the development of generative AI and large language models.', ""The relationship between Micron and Nvidia transcends the recently announced collaboration. In fiscal 2019, for example, Nvidia launched the GeForce RTX graphics card for the gaming market, which relied on Micron's memory chips."", ""Lee Samaha (Vertiv Holdings): The data center equipment provider's stock is on an incredible run. Up 549% over the last year and 103% in 2024 alone, investors must be wondering just how much longer the stock has to run, not least because it trades at 41 times estimated 2024 earnings."", ""Yes, the valuation looks heady, but not if we are only in the very early innings of a multi-year investment cycle in data centers driven by AI-related investment. Vertiv's digital infrastructure technology (power management, thermal management, rack systems, etc.) is critical to the functioning of data centers, and it's a solution advisor or consultant partner in the Nvidia partner network."", ""As such, it's a vital beneficiary of the boom in spending on AI, and the company's recent first-quarter earnings demonstrated the strength of the momentum in the trend. Its orders growth was up 60% from the first quarter of 2023, and its book-to-bill ratio was 1.5 times, implying significant revenue growth to come as the company executes on its $6.3 billion backlog."", ""Wall Street has Vertiv's free cash flow growing at 22% and 25% in the years after 2024, and if AI spending trends continue, Vertiv should be able to grow into its valuation. If you are bullish on Nvidia, it makes sense to look at Vertiv, too."", 'Daniel Foelber (Taiwan Semiconductor):  Taiwan Semi is a bet on sustained demand for chips for consumer electronics, the automotive industry, AI accelerators, and more. In 2023, the chip-making company commanded 61% of global chip-foundry activity.', ""Nvidia, Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, and others rely on Taiwan Semi to take their proprietary designs and manufacture to extremely precise specifications. Not to put down construction or engineering contractors, but what Taiwan Semi is doing is some of the most complicated manufacturing in the world. Taiwan Semi's ability to fulfill complex orders is why companies around the world outsource their chip manufacturing to Taiwan."", ""Investors may want to consider Taiwan Semi as a catch-all way to bet on the rising tides of AI, electrification, data centers, and the general need for more computing power. Taiwan Semi should benefit as long as overall demand is growing. It doesn't particularly care if AMD is taking market share from Nvidia or vice versa."", 'Despite its advantages, Taiwan Semi does have some risks -- namely competition and the need to simplify supply chains and localize chip manufacturing to reduce geopolitical risk. The CHIPS Act in the U.S., for example, is keen on allocating billions to increase domestic chip production. Taiwan Semi has fabs in the U.S., but it is still primarily manufacturing chips in Asia.', ""The tailwinds of AI are strong, but that doesn't mean that growth in the semiconductor industry is a straight line up. Apple, for example, is undergoing a slowdown driven by weak iPhone demand. Taiwan Semi's sales and earnings have flatlined recently as some of its core markets fall under pressure."", ""The good news is that analysts expect earnings to recover, with consensus estimates calling for $6.26 in 2024 earnings per share (EPS) and 2025 consensus estimates of $7.86. As a result, Taiwan Semi's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 22.7 compared to its current P/E of 27.2."", ""Despite being down just 10% from its all-time high, Taiwan Semi is a great value and a balanced buy for investors with the patience to endure the industry's cyclicality. It also sports a 1.4% dividend yield as a cherry on top of the strong underlying investment thesis."", 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

Higher interest rates have weighed on real estate values to increase their income yields above those of lower-risk income investments like bonds. In addition, higher rates have made it more expensive for REITs to borrow money to fund development projects and acquisitions. ', ""However, rates likely won't stay this high for much longer. The Federal Reserve plans to begin cutting them as soon as inflation is under control, which it hopes will be the case before the end of the year. As a result, now looks like a smart time to buy REITs. While many look attractive, Realty Income (NYSE: O), Prologis (NYSE: PLD), and Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE: MAA) stand out as some of the top options. They could turn a $1,000 investment into a lucrative income stream while also potentially delivering strong share-price gains. "", ""Realty Income built a real estate business designed to deliver dependable dividend income. It pays a monthly dividend that has steadily grown over the decades. It most recently delivered its 124th increase since its public market listing in 1994 (and 106th consecutive quarterly increase). Realty Income's dividend yields an attractive 5.6% at its recent share price. It could turn a $1,000 investment into $56 of annual dividend income at that rate. "", 'Elevated interest rates are currently a headwind for the company. Its share price sits about 25% below its high before the Fed started raising rates, which is a big reason why it has such a lofty yield. That has made it less attractive to issue new stock to fund acquisitions. Meanwhile, debt is more expensive. As a result, Realty Income only plans to invest about $2 billion to acquire real estate this year, which is well below its roughly $9 billion annual run rate in recent years. ', ""However, as rates fall, Realty Income's stock price should rise, enabling it to use shares as a currency to fund more deals. That would boost its growth and enhance its ability to continue increasing its dividend. The company's combination of income yield, earnings growth, and price appreciation potential positions it to produce strong total returns in the coming years. "", 'Prologis highlighted the impact rates are having on its business in its first-quarter earnings release. CEO Hamid Moghadam noted: ""While operating conditions are healthy in the majority of our markets, customers remain focused on controlling costs, which is weighing on decision making and the pace of leasing. A volatile and persistently high interest rate environment, together with mounting geopolitical concerns, contribute to this indecision and its short-term effect on net absorption."" That issue led the REIT to tweak its guidance, reducing its expectations for occupancy, same-store net operating income (NOI), and funds from operations (FFO). ', 'However, the CEO also stated, ""We remain optimistic about the fundamentals of our business."" Management believes things will be slower in the next quarter or two before reaccelerating due to the strong tailwinds driving the industrial real estate sector, including a favorable outlook on new supply. That drives Prologis\' belief its core FFO will increase by an average of 9% to 11% annually through 2026. ', 'That strong growth rate should enable Prologis to continue boosting its dividend at an above-average pace. With its dividend yield up to 3.6% -- due to a rising payout and lower stock price -- and robust growth ahead, Prologis could generate strong total returns as rates begin to ease. ', 'Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is battling interest rate and supply headwinds. Those issues weighed on its first-quarter results. Its same-store NOI dipped 0.7% in the period due to rising expenses and very modest rent growth. ', 'However, better days lie ahead, especially on the supply side. ""With continued solid demand and the resulting steady absorption of the new supply pipeline, we continue to believe that the decline in new supply deliveries expected late this year and into 2025 will fuel a strong and quick rebound in rent performance,"" CEO Eric Bolton stated in the first-quarter earnings release. Add in the likely easing of expense headwinds as inflation and rates fall, and the REIT could deliver stronger FFO-per-share growth in the future. ', 'Another growth catalyst is its investment program. MAA had five new communities under development at the end of the first quarter, which it expects to complete over the next two years. Meanwhile, it has a strong balance sheet, giving it plenty of flexibility to capture new growth opportunities. Add in its growth, share price upside as market conditions rebound, and attractive dividend (4.3% yield), and MAA could deliver robust total returns in the coming years. ', 'Falling rates have weighed on REIT stock prices, making their dividends more attractive. However, those high yields might not last much longer given that the Fed appears poised to start lowering rates. Because of that, high-quality REITs like Realty Income, Prologis, and MAA look like really smart investments right now.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Occidental Petroleum's  ROE today."", 'Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:', '13% = US$4.1b ÷ US$31b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.13 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""To begin with, Occidental Petroleum seems to have a respectable ROE. Be that as it may, the company's ROE is still quite lower than the industry average of 18%. However, we are pleased to see the impressive 37% net income growth reported by Occidental Petroleum over the past five years. We believe that there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently. Bear in mind, the company does have a respectable ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is higher. So this also does lend some color to the high earnings growth seen by the company."", ""We then performed a comparison between Occidental Petroleum's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 38% in the same 5-year period."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is OXY fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", 'Occidental Petroleum has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 3.1%, meaning that it has the remaining 97% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like Occidental Petroleum is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.', ""Additionally, Occidental Petroleum has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 18% over the next three years. However, Occidental Petroleum's future ROE is expected to rise to 19% despite the expected increase in the company's payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE."", ""Overall, we are quite pleased with Occidental Petroleum's performance. Specifically, we like that it has been reinvesting a high portion of its profits at a moderate rate of return, resulting in earnings expansion. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

On that note, if you have some extra cash to invest in stocks -- money that you don't need for bills or other essential costs -- here are two no-brainer growth stocks to scoop up right now."", ""Doximity (NYSE: DOCS) is trading down by about 29% from its position one year ago at the time of this writing. On its face, the platform provides various services for healthcare professionals, including networking solutions, medical news, telehealth capabilities, and career opportunities. In fact, 80% of U.S. physicians across all specialties are members of Doximity's network."", ""However, Doximity's bread and butter actually comes from two key services that it offers to its actual customers, who include large pharmaceutical companies and other healthcare entities. These services consist of marketing solutions and hiring solutions."", ""On the marketing side, Doximity's customers, like pharmaceutical companies, pay to advertise to the medical professionals using the platform. On the hiring side, its customers source talent and share job postings to medical professionals on the platform. Currently, 17 of the top 22 hospitals in the U.S. are enterprise clients of Doximity."", ""Most of Doximity's revenue comes from recurring subscriptions. The majority of its contracts with these pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and other large entities are one year or less, and these are renewable."", ""Despite what Doximity's share price might indicate, the business is doing well and generating substantial profits according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

The extensive adoption of the Doximity platform by the medical community is important, given that its pharmaceutical and other healthcare customers are marketing services and solutions specifically geared toward these individuals.', 'Doximity serves a durable need, and is doing so profitably. Long-term investors might find that its current valuation justifies buying a few shares on the dip.', 'Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA) is down about 22% from where the stock was 12 months ago.

Its product categories include skincare, cosmetics, haircare, and fragrances, all booming subsectors of the beauty space.', 'It currently has over 1,350 stores open in the U.S., with a focus on high-traffic environments. Almost every store offers beauty services, and its fruitful partnership with Target has also allowed it to cultivate over 500 Ulta Beauty in-store locations across the U.S. The standard Ulta Beauty store is around 10,000 square feet, with approximately 950 square feet of that space dedicated to a salon space.', ""One of the secrets to Ulta Beauty's continued success in a crowded, continually evolving beauty space is its loyalty program. The company says that 95% of its total sales come from loyalty members."", ""Interestingly, most of Ulta Beauty's members prefer to shop in-store versus online, although its dual digital and brick-and-mortar presence has been key to its growth trajectory. In 2023, management reported that 76% of its loyalty members bought only in a store, while 18% of loyalty members shopped both in store and online."", ""Most of Ulta Beauty's net sales come from cosmetics. In 2023, 41% of its total net sales were derived from this category. Management estimates its total addressable market in the beauty products industry at $112 billion, and it currently controls around 9% of this space. That's an impressive footprint given the scale of this industry, while also allowing plenty of room for expansion."", ""In the company's fiscal 2023, net sales totaled $11 billion, a 10% increase from fiscal 2022.

Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. But The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 30% over five years, which is below the market return. The last year has been disappointing, with the stock price down 0.6% in that time."", ""Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business."", ' See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ', ""To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", 'During five years of share price growth, Coca-Cola achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 9.6% per year.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Coca-Cola, it has a TSR of 52% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""Coca-Cola provided a TSR of 2.6% over the last twelve months.

That’s where dividend stocks come in. These equities accounted for an average of 34% of the market’s total returns from 1940 to 2023 and made significant contributions during decades of high inflation.

This highlights the compounding effect of dividends and solid returns they can deliver to long-term investors like Buffett. In addition to compounding benefits, it is worth mentioning that the company has consistently increased its dividends for over six decades. That is why financial experts always advise investing in dividend-growth stocks for long-term gains.', 'Kirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist in the Chief Investment Office for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, spoke about the importance of dividend growth stocks in the firm’s annual report.

Companies that have consistently increased their dividends tend to be more stable, higher-quality businesses, which historically have weathered downturns and are more likely to have the ability to pay dividends consistently.”', 'That said, maintaining dividend growth over time demands financial stability and unwavering commitment.

However, stocks touching new 52-week highs are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.', 'Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced.

This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.', 'Overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay the premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative.

With those categories being in a downturn recently, client spending has slowed down. This deceleration led to an abrupt 40% decline in DAVA’s stock price following its latest earnings report.', 'This plunge appears to be grossly overdone. Management has said that clients are merely deferring spending for a couple of quarters rather than abandoning future expansion plans.

The Biden Administration’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) authorized spending $850 billion across hundreds of different projects around the nation. Disbursement of that money is already well under way, with a great deal of jobs and economy activity arising as a result; this has been a massive stimulative event for industrial stocks.', 'In addition, technological breakthroughs are driving activity in the space. Electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, for example, are two megatrends that are creating numerous opportunities for industrial stocks.', 'But it’s not all good news for the sector. High interest rates are likely to serve as a major headwind to the sector going forward. The election this year could slam the brakes on further government investment in infrastructure. And in the hottest sectors, such as AI, sentiment seems to have gotten ahead of itself. All this makes it time to sell these three industrial stocks.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'I’ve been a longtime proponent of GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) stock.

Culp built an absolute powerhouse at Danaher (NYSE:DHR) in the early 2000s, and he was just the man for the job of fixing GE.', 'Under Culp’s leadership, GE sold or spun off almost all of its businesses, leaving it solely with its flagship aviation operation. Following the recent spin offs of its healthcare and energy divisons, the company renamed itself to GE Aerospace to reflect its new corporate direction. Everything is humming for the company, operationally speaking.', 'But at some point, enough is enough. GE stock has now run up from a (split-adjusted) $40 price in 2022 to more than $160 per share today. Even granting GE a sizable quality premium thanks to its CEO, things are still getting out of hand. The company, I’d reiterate, makes and services jet engines. This is not typically the sort of operation whose intrinsic value can quadruple in such a short period.', 'The aviation sector – some individual Boeing (NYSE:BA) technical problems excepted – is performing quite well right now. Travel demand came soaring back after the pandemic in what some have referred to as revenge spending. Airlines have raced to add capacity, increasing the opportunity for both new jet orders and servicing on existing planes.', 'I’d argue, however, that the positive sentiment has gone too far. Airlines, for all the positive results right now, remain a deeply cyclical industry. It seems likely that high interest rates and a slowing economy will eventually trip up the travel recovery. Meanwhile, with GE stock now selling at more than 30 times forward earnings, the valuation is quite steep for an industrial aviation company.', 'Source: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com', 'Eaton (NYSE:ETN) is an industrial company which offers engineered products primarily to support infrastructure, power solutions, and electrification.', 'Traditionally, Eaton has served industries such as aerospace and healthcare, offering solutions such as fuel pumps for airplanes and uninterruptable power supplies in medical centers. These sorts of specialized goods with a high cost of failure lead to steady revenues as customers are often reluctant to switch suppliers.', 'The legacy businesses aren’t what have the market excited, however. Rather, that’d be Eaton’s smaller but fast-growing operations supplying goods to data centers and the electric vehicle sector.', 'It’s understandable why investors are enthusiastic, as both of those categories should enjoy strong long-term growth. Data centers in particular are booming right now with the new developments in the generative AI space.', 'However, these revenue categories simply aren’t large enough yet to justify Eaton’s valuation, with shares of this usually sleepy industrial firm now up to 33 times earnings following an 85% rally over the past 12 months.', 'Morningstar’s Brian Bernard agrees that the current valuation is unsustainable. He sees shares as trading at a\xa042% premium\xa0to fair value today, and he gives Eaton stock a single star rating now, indicating that it is among the industrial stocks to sell.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Vertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT)\xa0designs, builds and maintains digital infrastructure. Specifically, it makes and services key components such as coolant systems that go into data centers and telecom networks among other use cases.', 'Like with Eaton, investors are extrapolating tremendous growth rates for Vertiv going forward. There’s certainly a possible scenario where AI growth maintains an exponential upward curve and Vertiv enjoys essentially unlimited demand.', 'However, investors should also be fully aware of the risk that demand peaks – or at a minimum growth greatly slows – in coming quarters. We already saw how fickle the market can be recently with Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), another AI components supplier whose shares plunged on slightly weaker-than-expected earnings.', 'Vertiv shares are up more than 500% over the past year. This has pushed the stock up to 90 times trailing earnings. If you believe the analyst estimates aren’t too optimistic, even then, Vertiv is still around 40 times projected 2024 earnings. If those earnings stop growing – let alone start going back down – VRT stock would get absolutely clobbered.

Market participants are just starting to realize the refiners are trading at a relative discount, and that could explain the excellent performance.', 'Year-to-date stock performance of oil refiners', '20-year stock performance of oil refiners', 'One of the reasons the industry has been overlooked as an energy play is because refining companies do not have the same political weight and, therefore risk, that big oil does. They are also not always subject to the same public protests, or even regulatory measures, that big oil can suffer from because their perceived impact on the environment is lower. Politics aside, we will focus on the hard figures.', 'The following table was compiled based on data extracted from GuruFocus screening tools and we will analyse it in this section, as the most revealing figures are displayed below.', 'Tickers', 'Market Cap ($M)', 'Price-Earnings', 'Price-to-FCF', 'Operating Margin', 'Return on Equity', 'Return on Assets', 'Dividend Yield', 'Current Ratio', 'VLO', '51,286', '7.77', '7.65', '6.78%', '27.14%', '11.32%', '2.63%', '1.59', 'MPC', '64,318', '9.12', '7.61', '6.85%', '31.39%', '9.07%', '1.73%', '1.43', 'PSX', '60,884', '11.05', '22.08', '4.37%', '19.18%', '7.60%', '2.92%', '1.17', 'The three stocks have similar market caps, and hence the comparison is actually fairly easy and relevant to perform. The two favored valuation metrics the markets like to use are price-earnings and price-to-cash flow. We saw in the previous section that Valero and Marathon are currently outperforming year to date and have done so over the last two decades. Despite their multiyear rallies, they remain cheaper than Phillips 66 because their rapid growth rates have continuously kept the valuation multiples down. The price-to-free cash flow ratio is actually even more revealing as Valero and Marathon accumulate more cash that can be reinvested than Phillips 66. Valero ended 2023 with $8.30 billion (down 23.60% from year prior) of free cash flow, while Marathon had $12.27 billion (down 12.3%) and Phillips 66 recorded a disappointing $4.61 billion of free cash flow, roughly cut in half from the year prior (-46.5%). This demonstrates a lower capability for Phillips 66 to withstand oil price declines like the ones we witnessed in 2023.', 'Furthermore, while Valero and Marathon are better at generating free cash flows, they are also better at investing them. The returns on equity are significantly higher for both companies. When ROE is higher, it gives an indication that future free cash flow is likely to grow. Every dollar invested produces roughly $1.30 for Valero and Marathon, while for Phillips 66 is at $1.20 (which is still a healthy figure). Phillips 66 has a higher dividend yield; but the combination of lower free cash flows, lower ROE and higher dividend yield cause increased stress to the company relative to its competitors. Although the current ratio is comfortably above 1 (a current ratio below 1 means the company has a higher probability to go bankrupt as it does not have enough current assets to cover current liabilities), in my opinion both Valero and Marathon are significantly more attractive plays for a long-term investor wishing to gain exposure to the oil refining sector.', ""As with every investment, there are specific risks to be considered when gaining exposure to refining stocks. The main risk is the U.S. monetary policy and its implications on the economy. While most stocks would see their valuations benefit from interest rate cuts, which are likely to occur at the end of this year and next year (possibly after a recession hits the U.S. economy), oil refining stocks are not as sensitive to the rates. They are overall more sensitive to energy demand, so the possible recession that could trigger the interest rate cuts could cause the demand for oil-related products to fade and hence to negatively impact the oil refining companies' revenues. A second risk is that we are in an election year and energy is often at the center of heated political debates. Therefore, although valuations and financials are highly attractive, diversification is necessary when initiating a buy position at this point in time, despite the quality of the underlying businesses."", 'Oil refining stocks represent an attractive energy play because of their relative resistance to oil price declines and also thanks to their financial health. Amongst the oil refining stocks, the most interesting stocks to buy are Valero and Marathon Petroleum as they have better hard figures and multiyear performance in relation to Phillips 66. Given the potential recession and a U.S. election year, it is more interesting to own the stocks within a diversified portfolio. Oil refinining stocks are significantly undervalued in relation to big oil. However, the performance over the last couple of decades and cheap valuation may indicate that we are in the middle of a multiyear rally in this industry.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

The Optum side includes software and analytics services for providers, life sciences companies, government organizations, and other clients; direct healthcare services including both virtual and in-person care across primary, surgical, urgent, and other specialties; pharmacy care services; and health financial services.', ""This is an extremely well-diversified business with an extensive footprint in some of those lucrative sectors of the healthcare space.

After Change took its systems offline following the breach, reimbursement to providers and pharmacies ground to a halt, threatening many small businesses and leading UnitedHealth to stand up a loan program\xa0amid intense public,\xa0legal\xa0and governmental\xa0pressure.', 'UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty was summoned to the Hill earlier this month amid the public fallout and was grilled by Congress over the breach.\xa0Lawmakers also took aim at UnitedHealth’s size and whether it was stifling healthcare competition, a criticism Witty attempted to head off on the insurer’s first-quarter call with investors.', 'Following the attack, “we were able to bring to bear the substantial resources of UnitedHealth Group to drive the recovery and begin to mitigate the impact —\xa0resources which a standalone Change Healthcare would not have had access to on its own,” Witty said.', 'Witty also described UnitedHealth as a “comparatively small part of the $5 trillion U.S.\xa0health system.” That’s despite UnitedHealth being the largest healthcare company in the U.S., with businesses in health insurance, pharmacy benefits, physician practices, banking and more. The company is currently facing an antitrust investigation by the Justice Department, which has grown more concerned about monopoly power in healthcare.', 'In stark contrast to the cyberattack’s fallout on providers, insurers emerged from the first quarter generally unphased by the breach. That arguably applies to UnitedHealth,\xa0too —\xa0the company expects up to $1.6 billion in costs this year as a result of the attack, a drop in the water of its $372 billion in annual revenue. UnitedHealth also doesn’t expect the attack to materially impact its 2024 earnings.', 'As for its peers,\xa0“we were not significantly impacted by this,” Elevance CEO Gail Boudreaux told investors in April.', 'Some insurers did experience a minor increase in operating expenses. But the biggest effect of the attack was\xa0that Change taking its systems down made it harder for insurers to predict\xa0how much they might have to spend on members’ medical costs.', 'As a result, major payers pulled hundreds of millions of dollars into reserves to account for claims lodged in the quarter that they had yet to receive.', 'However, executives assured investors they were confident about the adequacy of those reserves, and that the brunt of delayed claims came in before the quarter’s end.', '“By the time we closed the quarter, the impact was very modest,” Centene CEO Sarah London told analysts\xa0on the insurer’s April call.', 'Payers continued to jostle with a dogged increase in medical spend as more seniors in Medicare Advantage plans seek out healthcare following the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilization started to tick up early last year and remained elevated in the quarter, reflected in outpatient services like radiology and cardiovascular procedures for Elevance, or mental health and medical pharmacy for CVS, for example.', 'Inpatient care has risen too, which Centene,\xa0Humana, Elevance and CVS noted. The trend is concerning for insurers given hospital services are more expensive to cover.\xa0Some payers blamed the “two-midnight rule,” which requires them to cover an inpatient admission if the patient is expected to require hospital care for at least two midnights.', 'All MA insurers said their members were using more care. But some planned adequately for the increase in utilization, including Elevance, UnitedHealth and Cigna, which said they were comfortable with their pricing and benefit designs for 2024. Elevance, for example,\xa0saw its net profit rise 13% year over year because of how much it increased premiums on its members.', 'Others — Humana and CVS — appeared to have been caught unprepared.', 'Humana’s net income fell to $741 million in the quarter from $1.2 billion in the same time last year because of surging medical expenses. The insurer, the second largest MA payer after UnitedHealth, even pulled its profit outlook for 2025, citing turbulence in MA.', 'CVS similarly blamed utilization pressures after its first-quarter net income fell to $1.1 billion, roughly half as much as the insurer brought in during the same time last year. The results caused CVS’ stock to experience its largest single-day loss since 2009, and prompted a downgrade at investment bank TD Cowen.', 'Importantly, insurers are still notching profits — just not as high as they would like, and not enough to satiate Wall Street’s demand for growth in MA, a program that’s historically brought in significant earnings.', 'The key questions coming out of the first quarter are,\xa0“Will medical cost trends moderate in 2024? If so when and by how much,” and “who benefits most?” wrote TD Cowen analyst Gary Taylor in a note following the quarter.', 'Medical loss ratio by insurer, Q1 2023 to 2024 reported and full-year 2024 expected', 'Lower 2025 payment rates than insurers hoped from regulators in Washington looking to crack down on bad actors in the privately run Medicare program aren’t helping, either.', 'Insurance executives voiced their disapproval during quarterly calls.\xa0Elevance’s Boudreaux said she was “disappointed” in the rates,\xa0while CVS CEO Karen Lynch called them “insufficient” and a “significant added disruption” in the program.', 'In light of the challenges,\xa0insurers plan to focus\xa0on profits over growth, taking actions like cutting benefits,\xa0raising premiums or even exiting markets.', 'UnitedHealth’s Witty said the 2025 rate notice, while “a little disappointing,” is unlikely to change how UnitedHealth is approaching its preparations for next year.', 'Others said they’ll have to double down on cuts as a result.', 'The rates “will require larger benefit reductions to achieve stable margins,”\xa0Humana CFO Susan Diamond said.', 'Cowen’s Taylor noted all major MA insurers will likely earn “materially below” target margins this year, and “will be compelled to cut supplemental benefits materially” for 2025. That could reshape current MA market share.', 'Insurers are finalizing 2025 bids now, and will submit them to the CMS in early June.', 'MA isn’t the only source of turbulence for insurers: Medicaid redeterminations, the process wherein states recheck their beneficiaries’ eligibility for the safety-net program, have been ongoing since last spring.', 'Millions of Americans have been kicked off the coverage due to redeterminations, raising concerns that the acuity of payers’ membership pools may no longer match what they’re being reimbursed by states.', 'Though insurers reassured investors that rates have remained actuarially sound,\xa0a mismatch between rates and acuity drove up medical spend for Centene and CVS in the quarter. Executives for those payers said they’re talking with states about adjusting rates.', 'Meanwhile, for many payers, membership gains in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, along with a steady rate of “rejoiners” — people returning to Medicaid after being improperly removed from the program — have offset the worst of Medicaid losses.', 'The general sense on first-quarter calls was a looming return to business as usual, given redeterminations are roughly 90% complete, according to Centene, Molina and Elevance.', 'However, some payers were less than pleased about recent Medicaid contract awards in Florida, Michigan, Virginia and Texas.', 'Molina lost the Florida and Virginia contracts, which is expected to cost the company $500 million in revenue this year. Meanwhile, Centene lost in Texas and UnitedHealthcare lost in Florida.', 'Molina and Centene said in first-quarter calls they plan to challenge the decisions, while UnitedHealthcare didn’t say outright but suggested it might protest.', 'Along with challenging existing losses, insurers are also gearing up to fight for upcoming contracts.\xa0An estimated $60 billion in premiums is up for bid over the next three years, according to Molina CEO Joe Zubretsky.', 'Centene and Molina, both large Medicaid insurers, told investors they have a significant growth opportunity thanks to a new CMS rule finalized in April\xa0meant to streamline continuity of care for people covered by both Medicare and Medicaid.', 'Currently many dual-eligible members receive Medicaid and Medicare benefits from two different insurers. The rule essentially will move those unaligned members to the Dual Special Needs Plan (D-SNP) plan run by their Medicaid insurer.', 'As a result,\xa0having a broad Medicaid footprint will be a catalyst for MA growth, especially as the D-SNP population is forecasted to grow,\xa0insurance executives said.', '“The strategic link between Medicare and Medicaid has only become more explicit,” said Centene’s London.\xa0“By the end of the decade, a Medicaid footprint will be a prerequisite to D-SNP growth.”', 'Molina executives said the rule should help the insurer reach its mid-single digit target margins in Medicare — a higher target than some of its competitors, given it has a high percentage of dual-eligible members already.', 'Those members tend to be higher acuity, so the government pays insurers more to manage their care.', '“We like the D-SNP business, not only because it can produce excellent profits, but monetizing our Medicaid footprint for dual-eligible share over time is going to be a significant growth catalyst for us,” said Molina’s Zubretsky.', 'This story was originally published on Healthcare Dive.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their previous performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\xa0', 'For long-term investing, many investors aim for not just growth but a steady stream of income to keep their financial ship sailing smoothly. That’s where dividend stocks come in. These equities accounted for an average of 34% of the market’s total returns from 1940 to 2023 and made significant contributions during decades of high inflation. This shows that building wealth through dividends takes time and patience, so one shouldn’t expect a bountiful harvest overnight.', 'A clear example of the power of dividends can be observed through Warren Buffett’s investment in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Berkshire Hathaway acquired KO shares for $1.3 billion back in 1994 and received $75 million in cash dividends through this investment. In 2023, the dividend amount received by Berkshire had skyrocketed to a staggering $736 million, and it is set to receive $776 million in Coke dividends this year. This highlights the compounding effect of dividends and solid returns they can deliver to long-term investors like Buffett. In addition to compounding benefits, it is worth mentioning that the company has consistently increased its dividends for over six decades. That is why financial experts always advise investing in dividend-growth stocks for long-term gains.', 'Kirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist in the Chief Investment Office for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, spoke about the importance of dividend growth stocks in the firm’s annual report. Here is what she said:', '“Generally, it’s larger, more mature companies that return capital to their shareholders in the form of dividends.

A great example is Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), commonly known as P&G."", 'P&G is a $393 billion-dollar behemoth that just hit an all-time high, making it the second-most valuable U.S.-based consumer staples company, ahead of Costco Wholesale and just behind Walmart.', ""P&G owns several popular personal care and household goods brands, like Pampers, Tide, Bounty, Charmin, Gillette, Old Spice, Dawn, and dozens more. These brands don't attract the glitz and glam of popular luxury products. But that doesn't mean P&G lacks pricing power or a loyal customer base."", ""Here's why P&G hit an all-time high for all the right reasons, and why the dividend stock is worth considering now."", 'It took over two years, but P&G finally eclipsed its previous all-time high on Jan. 21, 2022, of $165.35 a share.', ""Back then, supply chain bottlenecks were still a widespread issue. It wasn't yet known how bad inflation would be or how long it would last. But P&G has done a masterful job navigating these issues. Its execution is one of the core reasons the stock deserves to make a new all-time high."", 'The easiest two ways for P&G to grow its business are higher volume and higher prices. Recently, volumes have been close to flat, but P&G has grown earnings thanks to higher margins and productivity savings.', ""Perhaps the simplest way to showcase P&G's success during this challenging time is to look at its sales and operating margin."", ""As the chart shows, P&G's sales surged over the last five years. Its margins only took a slight hit in 2022 and 2023, and have recovered to their highest level in 10 years."", ""During inflationary times, investors expect a company's sales to rise more than usual. However, these price increases are typically offset by higher costs, which can erode margins if the company lacks pricing power."", ""But in P&G's case, the margins held up and sales were higher, which drove growth for the company."", ""Looking at sales paired with operating margin is a good way to measure if sales growth is healthy or not. The metrics indicate that P&G was able to successfully pass along higher costs to customers -- a testament to the perceived quality of its portfolio of brands. Granted, volume growth will eventually need to come back, because there's a limit to how much P&G can raise prices without doing more harm than good."", 'P&G has historically traded at a premium valuation. Its current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and median P/E over several different time intervals are all more than 25.', 'You may be wondering why such a low-growth business deserves a high valuation. The reason is that P&G excels at delivering on its promises to shareholders.', 'Given the nature of its business, P&G only has so many ways to unlock growth before its spending would be reckless. The trick is to allocate capital wisely by building a strong portfolio of brands that achieves pricing power and can steadily grow earnings over time, while rewarding shareholders with buybacks and dividends. P&G has done exactly that over its rich history.', ""The stock has doubled over the last decade, the dividend and earnings are up more than 50%, and P&G has reduced its outstanding share count by 12.9%. It's not a jaw-dropping performance, but it checks the boxes that value and income investors may be seeking."", 'In April, P&G announced a sizable 7% increase to its dividend, bringing the quarterly dividend above $1 a share and marking the 68th consecutive annual increase. P&G is the longest-tenured consumer staple Dividend King, part of an elite cohort of companies that have increased their payouts for at least 50 years.', ""P&G's track record for dividend increases and the size of its increases make it one of the most reliable dividend stocks out there. But as mentioned, the company also buys back its own stock, which extends the capital return program beyond just dividends."", ""Despite being at an all-time high, P&G still yields 2.4%. It's not an ultra-high yield, but it is a decent one, especially coming from such a high-caliber company. And over the years, P&G has proven it isn't just a passive income play. The company has grown in value, rewarding shareholders with a blend of capital gains and dividend income."", ""Over the last three years, P&G has a nearly identical total return to that of the S&P 500, at 30.6% for P&G and 30.7% for the index, compared to 17.9% for the consumer staples sector. P&G has underperformed the S&P 500 over the last five-year and 10-year time frames, but crushed the performance of its sector. Still, P&G has put up impressive results during a very strong market period led mostly by high growth, tech-orientated companies. It's been difficult for the more defensive pockets of the market to keep pace with the indexes during this time, yet P&G has still put up respectable gains while rewarding its shareholders."", ""P&G is not a cheap stock, but it has made a new all-time high for the right reasons. The recent dividend raise was sizable, and P&G's margins and sales growth have been impressive given the circumstances."", 'Part of the recent run-up in P&G stock is likely due to the consumer staples sector hitting a 52-week high on May 10 as some investors get more defensive amid higher equity valuations and the risk of interest rates staying higher for longer.', ""Overall, P&G isn't a screaming buy, but it remains a foundational holding with a compelling investment thesis that can back up its current valuation."", 'Before you buy stock in Procter & Gamble, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Procter & Gamble wasn’t one of them.

And highest quality companies can see their share prices grow by huge amounts. For example, the Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) share price is up a whopping 319% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. This just goes to show the value creation that some businesses can achieve. It's also good to see the share price up 21% over the last quarter. The company reported its financial results recently; you can catch up on the latest numbers by reading our company report."", ""Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business."", ' See our latest analysis for Eaton ', ""To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price."", ""During five years of share price growth, Eaton achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 33% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth."", 'You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).', ""It is of course excellent to see how Eaton has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on Eaton's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further."", ""As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Eaton's TSR for the last 5 years was 370%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!"", ""It's good to see that Eaton has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 96% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 36%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Eaton ."", 'If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.', 'Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.', 'Have feedback on this article?

The Biden Administration’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) authorized spending $850 billion across hundreds of different projects around the nation. Disbursement of that money is already well under way, with a great deal of jobs and economy activity arising as a result; this has been a massive stimulative event for industrial stocks.', 'In addition, technological breakthroughs are driving activity in the space. Electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, for example, are two megatrends that are creating numerous opportunities for industrial stocks.', 'But it’s not all good news for the sector. High interest rates are likely to serve as a major headwind to the sector going forward. The election this year could slam the brakes on further government investment in infrastructure. And in the hottest sectors, such as AI, sentiment seems to have gotten ahead of itself. All this makes it time to sell these three industrial stocks.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'I’ve been a longtime proponent of GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) stock. That’s because I’m a believer in CEO Larry Culp. Culp built an absolute powerhouse at Danaher (NYSE:DHR) in the early 2000s, and he was just the man for the job of fixing GE.', 'Under Culp’s leadership, GE sold or spun off almost all of its businesses, leaving it solely with its flagship aviation operation. Following the recent spin offs of its healthcare and energy divisons, the company renamed itself to GE Aerospace to reflect its new corporate direction. Everything is humming for the company, operationally speaking.', 'But at some point, enough is enough. GE stock has now run up from a (split-adjusted) $40 price in 2022 to more than $160 per share today. Even granting GE a sizable quality premium thanks to its CEO, things are still getting out of hand. The company, I’d reiterate, makes and services jet engines. This is not typically the sort of operation whose intrinsic value can quadruple in such a short period.', 'The aviation sector – some individual Boeing (NYSE:BA) technical problems excepted – is performing quite well right now. Travel demand came soaring back after the pandemic in what some have referred to as revenge spending. Airlines have raced to add capacity, increasing the opportunity for both new jet orders and servicing on existing planes.', 'I’d argue, however, that the positive sentiment has gone too far. Airlines, for all the positive results right now, remain a deeply cyclical industry. It seems likely that high interest rates and a slowing economy will eventually trip up the travel recovery. Meanwhile, with GE stock now selling at more than 30 times forward earnings, the valuation is quite steep for an industrial aviation company.', 'Source: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com', 'Eaton (NYSE:ETN) is an industrial company which offers engineered products primarily to support infrastructure, power solutions, and electrification.', 'Traditionally, Eaton has served industries such as aerospace and healthcare, offering solutions such as fuel pumps for airplanes and uninterruptable power supplies in medical centers. These sorts of specialized goods with a high cost of failure lead to steady revenues as customers are often reluctant to switch suppliers.', 'The legacy businesses aren’t what have the market excited, however. Rather, that’d be Eaton’s smaller but fast-growing operations supplying goods to data centers and the electric vehicle sector.', 'It’s understandable why investors are enthusiastic, as both of those categories should enjoy strong long-term growth. Data centers in particular are booming right now with the new developments in the generative AI space.', 'However, these revenue categories simply aren’t large enough yet to justify Eaton’s valuation, with shares of this usually sleepy industrial firm now up to 33 times earnings following an 85% rally over the past 12 months.', 'Morningstar’s Brian Bernard agrees that the current valuation is unsustainable. He sees shares as trading at a\xa042% premium\xa0to fair value today, and he gives Eaton stock a single star rating now, indicating that it is among the industrial stocks to sell.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Vertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT)\xa0designs, builds and maintains digital infrastructure. Specifically, it makes and services key components such as coolant systems that go into data centers and telecom networks among other use cases.', 'Like with Eaton, investors are extrapolating tremendous growth rates for Vertiv going forward. There’s certainly a possible scenario where AI growth maintains an exponential upward curve and Vertiv enjoys essentially unlimited demand.', 'However, investors should also be fully aware of the risk that demand peaks – or at a minimum growth greatly slows – in coming quarters. We already saw how fickle the market can be recently with Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), another AI components supplier whose shares plunged on slightly weaker-than-expected earnings.', 'Vertiv shares are up more than 500% over the past year. This has pushed the stock up to 90 times trailing earnings. If you believe the analyst estimates aren’t too optimistic, even then, Vertiv is still around 40 times projected 2024 earnings. If those earnings stop growing – let alone start going back down – VRT stock would get absolutely clobbered. Given this possibility, Vertiv is considered among the industrial stocks to sell.', 'On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in DHR stock.

Recent clinical research finds that our robotic duck helps pediatric cancer patients cope with distress and anxiety associated with treatments.', 'In the multi-year study, both parents and caregivers reported a reduction in distress, nausea, pain and treatment - and procedural anxiety - for their children who received My Special Aflac Duck®, according to a clinical trial released April 5.', 'Research Team Includes (but not limited to):', ""Dr. Ann Mertens - Research Director of the Cancer Survivor Program at the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, and Professor of Pediatrics at Emory University School of Medicine "", ""Dr. James Klosky - Director of Psychology and Neuropsychology at the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, and Professor of Pediatrics at Emory University School of Medicine "", ""Dr. Tamara Miller - Pediatric Hematologist/Oncologist at the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Emory University School of Medicine"", ""Researchers at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and Emory University School of Medicine conducted a randomized clinical trial utilizing My Special Aflac Duck®.

""This finding is notable because we utilized a global measure of parental distress in the study, suggesting that My Special Aflac Duck® intervention resulted in significant symptom relief among those who care for young children on-treatment for cancer.""', ""Ines Rodriguez Gutzmer, Aflac senior vice president and Chief Communications Officer, said this unexpected finding is a celebrated addition to an overall positive study showcasing the duck's valuable contributions."", '""It\'s reassuring to confirm that My Special Aflac Duck is working, helping pediatric cancer patients and those who care for them,"" Gutzmer said. ""The impact of the duck on caregivers provides additional evidence that our efforts in supporting the entire children\'s ecosystem are tangible, helping them to stay well and strong and to be better equipped to care for the patients. This unexpected finding further expands the impact and success of the program.""', 'The Aflac Childhood Cancer Foundation Inc. has distributed more than 29,000 ducks free of charge to children three and up diagnosed with cancer and blood disorders such as sickle cell disease. The duck is also a hallmark of Aflac\'s commitment to children with cancer, which started in 1995 and continues today with $181 million and counting donated to research, treatment and awareness. My Special Aflac Duck® is the result of more than 18 months of research and development prior to the duck launching in 2018. The duck provides comfort and companionship through play, the way children are already accustomed to. The duck can also receive its own ""treatment"" through medical play accessories, one of the most-enjoyed features of the duck, according to the study. The medical play accessories further comfort the child by helping familiarize common medical equipment such as a stethoscope, an IV, a syringe and more. The corresponding App also enables children to use their imaginations to play and to learn more about their treatments.', '""This important research further extends our commitment to children with cancer, which has been our philanthropic focus for nearly 30 years,"" said Buffy Swinehart, senior manager of Corporate Social Responsibility at Aflac. ""Our work began at the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children\'s Healthcare of Atlanta and now extends throughout the U.S., Japan and Northern Ireland.

For example, chip leader Nvidia (NVDA) is up more than 200% over the past year while its market cap has ballooned to more than $2 trillion. That said, investors need to observe subtle changes on Wall Street and track which groups are garnering attention.', 'Over the past few weeks, there have been clues that investors are taking their foot off the proverbial gas pedal when it comes to tech’s favorability.

Nevertheless, though the bull market in gold and silver is widely followed at this juncture, Druckenmiller’s comments on the lesser-followed copper industry stood out to me in a recent CNBC interview. The full quote is below:', '“Copper is a pretty simply story. Takes about 12 years, greenfield to produce copper, and you got EVs, the grid, data centers, and believe it or not munitions. These missiles all got enough copper in them and the world’s getting hot that we just think the supply-demand situation is incredible for the next five or six years.”', 'Meanwhile, X user Brandon Beylo (@marketplunger) brought to my attention an interview with Robert Ivanhoe, CEO of Ivanhoe Mines and one of the most important voices in metals and mining.

We believe it would be prudent for investors to have a cautious approach toward Cisco, given the near-term challenges.', 'Cisco’s near-term prospects suffer from a sluggish demand environment with ongoing weakness at enterprise, as well as service providers and cloud end-markets. Inventory destocking at customers in its core networking domain is expected to continue over the next couple of quarters (at least through the end of Cisco’s fiscal 2024), thereby hurting top-line growth.Cisco now expects both service providers, including telecommunication and cable service providers, to start reinvesting in fiscal 2025 instead of the previous expectation of the second half of fiscal 2024. Moreover, it has witnessed sluggish demand in certain countries of the APJC and Europe. Both these factors are expected to hurt top-line growth in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter Networking revenues is currently pegged at $6.57 billion, suggesting a 13% year-over-year decline.Cisco’s prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition aggravated by Hewlett Packard’s HPE deal to acquire Juniper for roughly $14 billion. \xa0Hewlett Packard’s multi-billion-dollar investment plan across expanding networking capabilities is noteworthy. It has linked AI, Industrial Internet of Things, and distributed computing with its fast-growing networking business arm, Aruba Networks.Although the increase in AI-related workload presents a strong long-term opportunity for Cisco, HPE’s expanding footprint, thanks to the Juniper acquisition, is noteworthy for investors.These negative factors keep us on the sidelines. However, we acknowledge that Cisco’s long-term growth trajectory benefits from an expanding partner base that now includes NVIDIA NVDA, a strong security portfolio and acquisitions, including Splunk and Isovalent.Security portfolio expansion with solutions like XDR, Secure Access and Multicloud Defense suites are winning customers. Innovative product pipeline is a key catalyst for this segment.In fact, Cisco is expected to witness growth in the Security business thanks to its portfolio strength in the fiscal third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Security revenues is currently pegged at $1.03 billion, indicating 7.8% year-over-year growth.Cisco’s partnership with NVIDIA is expected to boost its footprint in the AI space. The partnership combines Cisco’s expertise in Ethernet networking with NVIDIA’s GPU technology. It aims to provide enterprises with easily deployable and manageable solutions for the evolving AI landscape.Although these positive factors present a solid investment opportunity, we believe investors should refrain from making any bets on Cisco in the current environment. Instead, a wait-and-see approach is advisable.', 'Per the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.
