It has amassed assets over $14.31 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Small Cap BlendWith more potential comes more risk, and small cap companies, with market capitalization below $2 billion, epitomizes this way of thinking.Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.CostsSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.57%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 19% of the portfolio. Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Super Micro Computer Inc (SMCI) accounts for about 0.37% of total assets, followed by Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC) and Churchill Downs Inc (CHDN).The top 10 holdings account for about 2.29% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHA seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Small-Cap Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Small-Cap Total Stock Market Index includes the small-cap portion of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index actually available to investors in the marketplace.Story continuesThe ETF has gained about 3.23% so far this year and is up roughly 5.11% in the last one year (as of 09/22/2023).

One such stock that merits attention is Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc (NYSE:ARE). The stock, which is currently priced at $102.93, recorded a loss of 8.29% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 7.83%. The stock's fair valuation is $186.48, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ARE. Click here to check it out.

The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) Stock: A Hidden Value Trap? Unpacking the Risks and RewardsUnpacking the Risk FactorsHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Alexandria Real Estate Equities should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.93. These indicators suggest that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesSnapshot of Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc (NYSE:ARE)Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc is an urban office real estate investment trust (REIT). It is engaged in the business of providing space for lease to life science, agtech, and technology tenants. The company has established a significant market presence in key locations, including Greater Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland, and Research Triangle. Alexandria has a longstanding and proven track record of developing Class A properties clustered in urban life science, agtech, and technology campuses that provide tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments.Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) Stock: A Hidden Value Trap? Unpacking the Risks and RewardsDecoding Alexandria Real Estate Equities's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of Alexandria Real Estate Equities's Altman Z-score reveals Alexandria Real Estate Equities's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Alexandria Real Estate Equities's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.04; 2022: 0.02; 2023: 0.02) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that Alexandria Real Estate Equities might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.When it comes to operational efficiency, a vital indicator for Alexandria Real Estate Equities is its asset turnover. The data: 2021: 0.09; 2022: 0.08; 2023: 0.08 from the past three years suggests a decreasing trend in this ratio. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. Therefore, a drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in Alexandria Real Estate Equities's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.ConclusionIn conclusion, despite its seemingly attractive valuation, the low Altman Z-Score and declining operational efficiency metrics suggest that Alexandria Real Estate Equities (NYSE:ARE) might be a potential value trap. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.64%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.08%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 1.82%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the insurance company had gained 1.4% over the past month. This has lagged the Finance sector's gain of 1.93% and outpaced the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.89% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Unum as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be October 31, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.92, up 27.15% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $3.1 billion, up 4.36% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.73 per share and revenue of $12.36 billion. These totals would mark changes of +24.48% and +2.94%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Unum should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Unum is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Looking at its valuation, Unum is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 6.35. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 12.51, so we one might conclude that Unum is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that UNM currently has a PEG ratio of 0.86. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. UNM's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.61 as of yesterday's close.The Insurance - Accident and Health industry is part of the Finance sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 32, which puts it in the top 13% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

The last hike of 4.3% to 48 cents per share was announced in September 2022. Over the past five years, it increased dividends four times, with an annualized dividend growth rate of 6.06%.Considering last day’s closing price of $34.41 per share, the company’s current dividend yield stands at 5.6%. This is impressive compared with the industry’s average of 4.58% and attracts investors as it represents a steady income stream.U.S. Bancorp Dividend Yield (TTM) U.S. Bancorp Dividend Yield (TTM)U.S. Bancorp dividend-yield-ttm | U.S. Bancorp Quote Apart from dividends, USB also has a share repurchase program in place. In January 2021, the company’s board of directors authorized repurchase of common shares worth $3 billion. Such steady capital distribution activities are likely to stoke investors’ confidence in the stock.It should be noted that owing to MUFG Union Bank acquisition deal, U.S. Bancorp suspended share repurchases at the beginning of third-quarter 2021.The company is continuing the suspension as it intends to accrete its capital amid likelihood of stringent regulatory capital requirements. Hence,it did not repurchase shares under the current authorization in the first half of 2023.As of Jun 30, 2023, USB had cash and due from banks of $70.64 billion and long-term debt of $45.28 billion. With a record of an impressive earnings strength and decent cash levels, dividend payments seem sustainable.Further, USB’s strong fundamentals make it an impressive investment option. It has experienced strong growth in average loans and deposits during the past few years, as it continued to expand and deepen relationships with current customers as well as acquire new customers and market share.Story continuesAlso, organic growth and diverse revenue sources are key strengths of U.S. Bancorp. Revenues witnessed a compound annual growth rate of 1.3% over the last four years (2019-2022). This rise was chiefly due to higher net interest income (NII) with some annual volatility. The rising trend continued in the first half of 2023.U.S. Bancorp has made a number of strategic acquisitions in the past years, which have opened new markets to it and fortified existing markets. In December 2022, U.S. Bancorp completed the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank’s core regional banking franchise from MUFG, expanding its branch network and enjoying greater access to digital banking tools. The company completed the conversion of Union Bank during second-quarter 2023.On the flipside, USB’s escalating expenses are likely to hinder bottom-line growth in the upcoming period. Also, loan concentration (50.4% of total commercial loans in total loan portfolio) amid an uncertain economy and legal hassles are likely to act as near-term headwinds.Over the past three months, shares of USB have gained 6.8% compared with the industry‘s growth of 3.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUSB currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, Integer has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Edwards Lifesciences has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that ITGR's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.ITGR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.47, while EW has a forward P/E of 28.24.

These regions are already familiar with Walmart's healthcare initiative, Walmart Health. The proposed acquisition could substantially boost Walmart's expansion plans in the healthcare sector and accelerate its growth.Walmart Health, aimed at providing affordable healthcare options to Americans, offers a range of services including medical appointments, dental services and counseling with licensed therapists. Some locations also offer psychiatric services. As of the end of 2022, there were 32 Walmart Health locations. The company aims to increase this number to at least 75 by the end of next year.The company's potential entry into the healthcare sector aligns with its larger strategy of leveraging its extensive retail network. Approximately 90% of the U.S. population resides within ten miles of a Walmart store. This positioning could provide Walmart with a considerable growth opportunity as the country spends over 18% of its GDP on healthcare - amounting to $4.3 trillion in 2021.Walmart has maintained financial stability with profits exceeding $11 billion consistently over the last four fiscal years. This financial strength could enable the company to invest substantially in expanding its role in the healthcare industry.The potential acquisition of ChenMed and Walmart's ambitious plans for its healthcare sector highlight the retail giant's strategic diversification efforts.

They had all the employee information needed to sound convincing. And once they got access, they’d quickly find their way into the company's most sensitive repositories to steal that data for extortion.Ransomware attacks are not new, but this group was extraordinarily skilled at social engineering and bypassing multi-factor authentication, said Wendi Whitmore, senior vice president for the security firm Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat intelligence team, which has responded to several intrusions tied to the group.""They are much more sophisticated than many cybercriminal actors. They appear to be disciplined and organized in their attacks,"" she said. ""And that's something we typically see more frequently with nation-state actors, versus cyber criminals.""Known in the security industry variously as Scattered Spider, Muddled Libra, and UNC3944, these hackers were thrust into the limelight earlier this month for breaching the systems of two of the world's largest gambling companies - MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment Ltd.Behind the scenes, it has hit many more companies, according to analysts tracking the intrusions - and cybersecurity specialists expect the attacks to continue.The FBI is investigating the MGM and Caesars breaches, and the companies did not comment on who may be behind them.From Canada to Japan, the security firm CrowdStrike has tracked 52 attacks globally by the group since March 2022, most of them in the United States, said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of threat intelligence at the company. Google-owned intelligence firm Mandiant, has logged more than 100 intrusions by it in the last two years.Story continuesNearly every industry, from telecommunications to finance, hospitality, and media, has been hit. Reuters was not able to determine how much money the hackers may have extorted.But it's not just the scale or the breadth of attacks that make this group stand out. They're extremely good at what they do and ""ruthless"" in their interactions with victims, said Kevin Mandia, Mandiant's founder.The speed at which they breach and exfiltrate data from company systems can overwhelm security response teams, and they have left threatening notes for staff of victim organizations on their systems, and contacted them by text and email in the past, Mandiant found.In some cases - Mandia did not say which ones - hackers tied to Scattered Spider placed bogus emergency calls to summon heavily armed police units to the homes of executives of targeted companies.The technique, called SWATing, ""is something that’s utterly dreadful to live through as a victim,"" he said. ""I don’t even think these intrusions are about money. I think they’re about power, influence and notoriety. That makes it harder to respond to.""Reuters couldn't immediately reach the hacking group for comment.17-22 YEAR OLDSThere's little detail on Scattered Spider's location or identity. Based on the criminals’ chats with victims and clues gleaned from breach investigations, CrowdStrike's Meyers said they are largely 17-22 years-olds. Mandiant estimates they’re mainly from Western countries, but it's unclear how many people are involved.Before calling helpdesks, the hackers acquire employee information including passwords by social engineering, especially 'SIM swapping' - a technique where they trick a telecom company's customer service representative to reassign a specific phone number from one device to another, analysts say.They also appear to make the effort to study how large organizations work, including their vendors and contractors, to find individuals with privileged access they can target, according to analysts.That’s something David Bradbury, chief security officer of the identity management firm Okta, saw first-hand last month, when he discovered multiple Okta customers – including MGM – breached by Scattered Spider. Okta provides identity services such as multi-factor authentication used to help users securely access online applications and websites.""The threat actors have clearly taken our courses that we provide online, they've clearly studied our product and how it works,"" Bradbury said. ""This is stuff we haven't seen before.""A larger group named ALPHV said last week it was behind the MGM hack, and analysts believe it provided the software and attack tools for the operation to be carried out by Scattered Spider.Such collaborations are typical for cybercriminals, said Okta's Bradbury. ALPHV, which according to Mandiant is a ""ransomware-as-a-service"", would provide services such as a helpdesk, webpage and branding, and in turn get a cut of whatever Scattered Spider would make from the hack.While many ransomware attacks go unpublicised, the MGM hack was a vivid example of the real-world impact of such incidents. It caused chaos in Las Vegas, as gaming machines stalled and hotel systems were disrupted.Ransomware gangs often function like large organizations, and continue to evolve their methods to adapt to the latest security measures organizations use.""In some ways this is just like the age-old game of cat and mouse,"" said Whitmore, who compared Scattered Spider to Lapsus$, another group behind previous hacks into Okta and the technology giant Microsoft. The British police last year arrested seven people between the ages of 16 and 21 following those hacks.(Reporting by Zeba Siddiqui in San Francisco and Raphael Satter in New York; Editing by Chris Sanders and Claudia Parsons)]"

The company continued to witness higher-than-planned demand in its wholesale business for the third consecutive quarter in second-quarter fiscal 2023. This was mainly driven by the strength of product offerings and lower inventory. Management envisions an improved demand trend for the second half of 2023.The company has been implementing several measures, including improved pricing and optimized inventory management, to counteract the impacts of decreased consumer demand. These efforts have yielded positive results, surpassing expectations in terms of earnings and cash flow from operations in the second quarter of 2023.CRI is trying to reduce inventory levels to improve product sell-throughs, price realization and the gross profit margin. It also expects significant improvement in sales and earnings in the second half this year, driven by stronger product offerings, improved on-time shipping performance, and lower ocean freight rates and product costs.The company has been on track to strengthen its e-commerce capabilities through investments to speed up deliveries. Its e-commerce business’s strength continued in second-quarter 2023 on expanded omnichannel facilities, including curbside pickup, same-day pickup, buy online and pickup at store and ship from store. This, along with the easy access to a broad array of online products when shopping in stores, bodes well. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Driven by these factors, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 3.2% in the past three months against the industry's decline of 13.4%.Hurdles on the WayCarter’s is reeling from macroeconomic headwinds, including inflation, higher interest rates, rising consumer debt levels and risk of recession, affecting the demand from consumers and wholesale customers. This resulted in a sluggish year-over-year performance in second-quarter fiscal 2023. Adjusted earnings of 64 cents per share fell from the $1.30 reported in the prior-year quarter. The company reported net sales of $600 million in the second quarter of 2023, which declined 14.3% from the $700.7 million reported in the year-ago period.As a result, management projects fiscal 2023 sales of $2.95-$3 billion compared with the earlier mentioned $3 billion. Notably, it reported net sales of $3.2 billion in the previous year. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are likely to be $5.95-$6.15 compared with the prior stated $6.15. Notably, it reported an EPS of $6.90 in 2022.Adjusted operating income is forecast to be $325-$340 million, down from the previously communicated $350 million. The estimate indicates a decline from the $388.2 million reported in the year-ago period. We expect adjusted operating income to decline 16.2% year over year in 2023.For the third quarter of 2023, net sales are expected to be $770-$790 million, whereas it reported $819 million in the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted earnings are likely to be $1.45-$1.55, suggesting a decline from the $1.68 reported in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating income is expected to be $80-$85 million, implying a dip from the $91.6 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.The third-quarter guidance indicates continued inflationary pressure on consumer demand. The company also expects comparable interest expenses, a higher effective tax rate, SG&amp;A rate deleverage and a lower average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter of 2023.Story continuesConclusionWe believe that Carter’s strategic measures, stronger product offerings, improved on-time shipping performance and robust pricing efforts will play a pivotal role in mitigating the ongoing demand challenges.The P/CF ratio for Carter’s is just 7.65, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 9.28. Clearly, CRI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles. Topping it, a VGM Score of A reflects its inherent strength.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Crocs CROX, Royal Caribbean RCL and MGM Resorts MGM.MGM Resorts currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 81%, on average.

Itineraries span the gorgeous blue lagoon of Bora Bora, the black sand beaches of Tahiti, the colorful coral reefs of Raiatea, the soaring mountains in the verdant jungles of Nuku Hiva and more. Four of the seven new sailings link French Polynesia with the captivating craters, dramatic canyons and lush waterfalls of the Hawaiian archipelago. With Oceania Cruises, you can experience the paradise of these islands firsthand on immersive itineraries, discovering the traditions of native Polynesian culture, tasting the fresh flavors of the local cuisine and exploring the local communities and surrounding natural wonders.""At Oceania Cruises, we offer a captivating array of sailings in French Polynesia and Hawaii, charting lesser-known coastlines and taking travelers to boutique ports and off-the-beaten-track islands thanks to our small, luxurious ships,"" commented Frank A. Del Rio, President of Oceania Cruises. ""One of the highlights of these parts of the world is undoubtedly the food. Whether you're exploring Bora Bora and Nuku Hiva or Nawiliwili and Hilo, the flavors of these islands are meant to be savored and enjoyed just as much as the spectacular scenery.""Story continuesSailing from Tahiti or Honolulu, the seven new voyages range from 10 to 18 days, allowing plenty of time for exploration, adventure and relaxation in these stunning regions of the world. While Tahiti may feel worlds away, the gateway of Papeete is readily accessible by flight from New York, Los Angeles, Paris, London and Sydney with convenient 8-hour non-stop flights from Los Angeles and 5-hour non-stop flights out of Auckland. Similarly, Honolulu is just a 6-hour direct flight away from Los Angeles and an 8 ½-hour direct flight from Auckland. In addition to the seven new sailings aboard Regatta in 2025, there are dozens of other destination-rich itineraries to choose from in the South Pacific, as well as Australia and New Zealand, in 2024 and 2025 with Oceania Cruises.NEW SUMMER SAILINGS IN 2025Polynesian Dreams: 15 days from Honolulu to Papeete aboard Regatta, visiting Honolulu, Nawiliwili, Lahaina, Kailua-Kona, Hilo, Nuku Hiva, Rangiroa, Raiatea, Bora Bora and Papeete. Departs August 1 and September 15, 2025, which offers the itinerary in reverse.Tahitian Legends: 10 days from Papeete to Papeete aboard Regatta, visiting Papeete, Moorea, Fakarava, Nuku Hiva, Rangiroa, Bora Bora and Raiatea.

Guests will experience the ultimate in small ship luxury, with just 340 lavish suites and luxurious staterooms, nearly 70% of which feature private verandas. Lose yourself in one of the hundreds of books in the top-of-ship library, relax and rejuvenate in the Aquamar Spa + Vitality Center or socialize with old and new friends in one of the eight lounges and bars on board. After dinner in one of the four gourmet, open-seating restaurants, take in a show or spend the evening in the casino.EAT YOUR WAY THROUGH FRENCH POLYNESIA &amp; HAWAIIOne of the best ways to delve into the local island culture is through food, and both French Polynesia and Hawaii serve up some mouth-watering specialties, exotic dishes and delicious delicacies.Try poisson cru: French Polynesia's version of ceviche, this dish features local raw fish marinated in coconut milk and lime juice, often with vegetables. You'll have plenty of chances to try it on a variety of excursions, and you'll regularly see it on local menus.The mahi mahi burger and a mai tai at Bloody Mary's in Bora Bora are not to be missed. The thatched-roof restaurant with sand floors has served well-known faces including Jimmy Buffet, Ronnie Wood of The Rolling Stones and movie star couple Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell – it's an experience to remember.Don't pass on the breadfruit: Called uru in Tahitian, this strangely versatile starch will appear on the table prepared in more ways than you can keep track of and is quintessentially French Polynesian. A staple form on Nuku Hiva involves roasting it over hot coals and then mashing it with coconut milk to create a dish called kaka.You can't visit Hawaii without trying traditional poke, a raw fish bowl favored for its simplicity and freshness. Though all sorts of variations have become popular the world over, try ahi poke or tako poke – octopus – in its birthplace for a true taste of the classic dish.A must-have at luaus, kalua pork is another Hawaiian favorite you'll find across the islands. The traditional method of slow roasting the pork in an imu, or underground pit, and seasoning it with local sea salt results in a succulent, smoky meat typically paired with rice and sauteed cabbage or coleslaw.DESTINATION HIGHLIGHTSBora Bora, French Polynesia, one of the most photogenic islands, is dominated by two peaks – Mount Otemanu and Mount Pahia – both more than 2,000 feet high. Covered in emerald greenery, they create a dramatic backdrop for Bora Bora's shimmering lagoon, renowned for its breathtaking turquoise water. Under the sea, the reef encircling the island is a haven for a rainbow of exotic fish and turtles. Explore Bora Bora's dazzling lagoon, go on a guided off-road adventure across the island or see sharks and stingrays from the comfort of a glass-bottom boat.Papeete, Tahiti, is the capital of French Polynesia, with clear blue waters, swaying palm trees, balmy weather and rich island culture. Enjoy a wide variety of restaurants and the best shopping in the region – be sure to look out for exquisite hand-carved wooden figurines and bowls as well as colorful patchwork textiles called tifaifai, appliqued quilts that are often handed down for generations. Feeling energetic? Then be sure to hike inland a couple of miles to Fautaua Waterfall, Tahiti's highest at an incredible 443 feet. Learn about the iridescence and luster of pearls at the Robert Wan Pearl Museum or take a walking tour of the colorful and creative street art and murals painted by talented international artists.Hilo, Hawaii, is on the east coast of the Big Island and is renowned for its lush greenery. See how the 2018 reawakening of Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of fire and volcanoes, has changed the landscape at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Thrill seekers can choose from excursions such as a helicopter ride to Kilauea Volcano or zip-lining through a river gorge. Or for those who want to take it easier, a visit to Richardson Ocean Park, a black sand beach carved into the rocky shoreline, or a stroll through farmers markets with aisles of colorful fruits, vegetables and flowers, would be perfect.Kailua-Kona on Hawaii has a laid-back vibe and myriad things to do: roam a national park, swim or snorkel in the sea, or play a round of golf at one of three courses overlooking the ocean. Visit Mountain Thunder Coffee Plantation to learn about different beans and roasts and sample some of the aromatic fresh brews. Experience Magic Sands Beach, a beautiful stretch of turquoise water and white sand – when it's there. It's named Magic Sands Beach because every so often a big storm will take all the sand out to sea, exposing rock until the sandy beach is returned by the sea over time.simply MORE™Oceania Cruises offers travelers simply MORE, with virtually everything included in the voyage fare: free roundtrip airfare; free airport transfers; a generous shore excursion credit; and a comprehensive beverage package available during lunch and dinner at onboard restaurants featuring dozens of vintage Champagnes, premium wines and international beers. Created to elevate the guest experience, simply MORE means travelers receive the greatest value in luxury cruising.For additional information on Oceania Cruises' small-ship luxury product, exquisitely crafted cuisine, and expertly curated travel experiences, visit www.oceaniacruises.com, call 855-OCEANIA, or speak with a professional travel advisor.About Oceania CruisesOceania Cruises is the world's leading culinary- and destination-focused cruise line.

The case pertains to an almost $1bn margin call on trades in Hugo Boss, which Frasers alleges was handled ""arbitrarily"" and ""incorrectly"" by Morgan Stanley.In documents filed with the court and seen by The Telegraph, Frasers seeks to understand the extent of Mr. Gorman's involvement in decisions regarding the margin call. The retail group claims that Mr. Gorman, who has been at the helm of Morgan Stanley since 2010, should testify and produce documents related to the case.The dispute originates from a margin call made by Morgan Stanley in May 2021 on Saxo Bank, concerning certain put and call options in Hugo Boss held by Frasers. Morgan Stanley allegedly tried to force Frasers to close these options positions, causing significant losses for the retailer. Saxo Bank attempted to pass the margin call through to Frasers, but the retailer successfully obtained injunctive relief in June 2021, preventing the banks from taking any steps related to the margin call.Frasers is seeking €50m ($58m) in damages from Morgan Stanley for losses incurred due to what it terms as an ""unnecessary"" $995m margin call. The retailer argues that Morgan Stanley treated it like a family-office investment vehicle due to Mike Ashley's large stake in the company.Reportedly, Ashley offered £100m ($136m) and his entire £1.9bn ($2.6bn) stake in Frasers as collateral to meet the margin call, but his offer was rejected.Frasers' allegations also suggest that Morgan Stanley's scrutiny of its business with family offices heightened after the collapse of Archegos Capital Management. According to the retailer, this led to Morgan Stanley's prime brokerage investigating and removing ""family-office type"" businesses, which contributed to the bank's ""unusually hostile attitude"" towards Frasers' Hugo Boss position.Story continuesThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Saxo, which passed the margin call from Morgan Stanley onto Frasers, was also named as a defendant in the lawsuit but reached a confidential settlement with Frasers, documents show.Frasers said there was no counterclaim from Morgan Stanley.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

This initiative will increase service reliability and help reduce service disruptions for its customers.The upgrade is the fourth in a line of initiatives aimed at improving reliability for Central Jersey customers. In 2022, JCP&amp;L began construction on two projects to upgrade 19 miles of transmission power lines in the Monmouth County region. This initiative will further benefit nearly 50,000 customers. The subsidiary aims to spend $223 million for upgrading more than 60 miles of transmission lines around the county.Benefits of the UpgradeThe 34.5-kilovolt power line runs south from JCP&amp;L's Elberon Substation to its Allenhurst Substation, traversing Long Branch, Ocean Township, Deal and Allenhurst. As part of the project, JCP&amp;L aims to install new poles, wires and equipment in place of the existing ones that have been there since the 1970s.More electrical load can be carried by the newly built cables, which will also be able to handle increased customer demand. In case of unanticipated service outages on nearby lines, it will also be able to carry more electricity. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2023.Additionally, this operation provides a backup power source that will help keep the lights on if the normal power cables or equipment need to be repaired or taken out of service.The project is a part of the multi-year effort Energizing the Future, which aims to modernize FE's transmission system with cutting-edge machinery and technology that will help further strengthen the power grid and reduce the frequency and duration of customer outages.  Through 2022, FirstEnergy has invested more than $10 billion to the Energizing the Future program.Need for UpgradesA rise in temperature not only increases the demand for electricity but also poses a threat to electric infrastructure. These upgrades and maintenance tasks are crucial to maintaining service reliability and ensuring customer satisfaction.FirstEnergy has been strengthening its transmission and distribution operations. During the second-quarter, the company upgraded its 69-kilovolt transmission line. This line traverses Springfield Township and Moorefield Township for a distance of slightly more than 11 miles to the northeast, with sections of the line running alongside Interstate 68.Story continuesUtilities’ Focus on InfrastructureIn order to provide reliable services to customers, utilities make systematic investments to upgrade transmission and distribution lines and develop new substations. The objective is to warrant proper supply of electricity to millions of customers across the United States.Along with FirstEnergy, other electric power companies like Xcel Energy, Inc. XEL, Exelon Corporation EXC and Duke Energy DUK are adopting measures to strengthen their existing infrastructure.Xcel Energy aims to spend $29.5 billion during 2023-2027, out of which it plans to invest nearly $18 billion in strengthening its electric distribution and transmission operations.XEL’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 6.07%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) implies a year-over-year improvement of 5.4%.Exelon invests substantially in infrastructure projects. It plans to spend nearly $31.3 billion during 2023-2026 on regulated utility operations for grid modernization and enhancement of its infrastructure’s resilience.EXC’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS implies a year-over-year improvement of 3.5%.Duke Energy remains focused on expanding its scale of operations and implementing modern technologies at its facilities. Almost 85% of the company’s planned investment funds its generation fleet transition and grid modernization. This includes approximately $75 billion to modernize and strengthen its transmission and distribution infrastructure.DUK’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.09%.

For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce's customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce's system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.""Story continuesCopyright: drserg / 123RF Stock PhotoSalesforce, Inc.

But last month, the company relaunched as Airkit.ai and launched its first out-of-the-box integrated product, a GPT-4-based platform that allows companies such as OpenTable and ShipBob to build specialized customer service chatbots that can deal with queries around order status, refunds, product information and more.AirkitAirkit.

The duo launched their new company in 2020 with $28 million in funding from investors including Accel and Salesforce Ventures, which also invested in follow-on rounds, taking Airkit.ai's total funding to $68 million in its six-year history.And then last year, Airkit also landed on Salesforce's enterprise cloud marketplace, AppExchange.The hype spurred by ChatGPT and the broader generative AI movement is palpable, with investors falling over themselves to back the next big thing. Thus, a generative AI startup with such strong connections to Salesforce already was always going to be an attractive proposition, particularly given that Salesforce had recently pledged to invest $500 million in generative AI startups.When the deal closes, expected by January, 2024, Salesforce says that Airkit.ai will be merged into its customer service platform Service Cloud, with Evans continuing to lead the business.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/salesforce-airkit/]"

Republicans prize its conservative-leaning audience, but critics accuse it of bias and say it has made U.S. politics more toxic.Trump is far and away the front-runner for the Republican nomination. If he is selected as the Republican nominee, he would face Biden in a November 2024 general election.""This provides an opportunity for a reset between President Trump and the Fox News network,"" Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said of Lachlan Murdoch's appointment. ""The question is: does Lachlan Murdoch want to have a positive relationship with former President Donald Trump? Or does he want to see how things play out?""Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment about political coverage under Lachlan Murdoch. Trump does still appear occasionally on Fox News, and gave an interview to the network's chief political anchor, Bret Baier, in June.Story continuesAn aide to Donald Trump said any response to Rupert Murdoch stepping down would come from Trump himself on his Truth Social media platform. Trump had not made any comment by Thursday evening.Jason Osborne, an adviser to the former Republican president's 2016 campaign, said he hoped Lachlan Murdoch and other Fox executives would seek to boost Trump coverage and that both sides could mend ties.""The only path up is regaining those viewers that they lost. And the viewers that they lost veer more towards Trump,"" Osborne said. ""I think there will be outreach if it hasn't already occurred.""Fox executives in 2021 decided to more forcefully rebut Trump's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him through voter fraud, a conspiracy theory that fueled the Capitol Hill riot. Fox lost Trump-supporting viewers to smaller, right-wing cable networks such as Newsmax and One America News Network after the decision.NOT 2016 AGAINFox was a cheerleader for Trump in his ultimately successful 2016 White House campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton, a symbiotic relationship that continued up to the 2020 election.Trump boosted Fox's ratings, while Fox boosted Trump politically, said Larry Stuelpnagel, an associate professor of journalism and political science at Northwestern University and a former broadcast journalist.Dan Cassino, a politics professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, said he does not believe Fox's coverage of Trump will return to 2016 levels. But he added indications are that Lachlan Murdoch is not anti-Trump and as Trump remains the front-runner, coverage of him will likely be ""high volume"".During the Dominion litigation, documents emerged in which Lachlan Murdoch instructed Fox News executives to rein in critical coverage of Trump after he lost the 2020 election.Analysts said those could be heat-of-the-moment instructions over ratings, rather than a vision for how he wanted to cover Trump in the future.Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist, said Fox's support of Trump's election lies had been costly, but she was skeptical the network would fundamentally change when it comes to Trump. ""Their coverage continues to peddle in misinformation and conspiracy theories,"" Finney said.Stuelpnagel said he believed the high cost of the Dominion lawsuit might make Lachlan Murdoch tread carefully on Trump coverage.""The Dominion lawsuit cost them dearly,"" Stuelpnagel said. ""I think Lachlan is going to be more cautious in how he deals with Trump. I don't see a wholesale change in the direction of network.""

It is the vehicle through which the elder Murdoch controls News Corp and Fox Corp, through a roughly 40% stake in voting shares of each company. Murdoch also holds a small amount of shares of the companies outside of the trust.Upon Rupert’s death, News Corp and Fox Corp voting shares will be transferred from Murdoch to his four oldest children – Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James – creating a scenario in which three of the children could out-vote a fourth, potentially setting up a battle over the future of the companies, even as Lachlan Murdoch runs Fox Corp and is the sole chair of News Corp.This tension would likely play out over the future of Fox News, one of the most polarizing properties in the Murdoch empire, and an influential force in U.S. politics, particularly among Republicans who prize Fox's conservative-leaning audience.While Lachlan Murdoch does not speak publicly about his political views, James Murdoch has been more forthright. In January 2020, he and his wife Kathryn took aim at both News Corp and Fox Corp for downplaying the impact of climate change, widely viewed as a contributing factor to the Australian bushfires, in a statement to The Daily Beast.In a July 31, 2020 letter tendering his resignation from News Corp’s board of directors, which was disclosed in a News Corp filing, James Murdoch said he was resigning ""due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.""Story continuesMultiple media outlets, including the New York Times, Vanity Fair and the Financial Times, have reported on tension between the brothers over the direction of Fox and other family-controlled media outlets.In a 2021 FT interview, James Murdoch appeared to slam the channel without naming Fox News in comments about the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol siege. “The sacking of the Capitol is proof positive that what we thought was dangerous is indeed very, very much so,” he said. “Those outlets that propagate lies to their audience have unleashed insidious and uncontrollable forces that will be with us for years.”The Murdoch Family Trust has eight votes: four of which are controlled by Murdoch, and the remaining four controlled by the four children from his first two marriages. Murdoch’s youngest daughters Chloe and Grace, from his third wife Wendi Deng, do not have voting rights in the trust.Upon succession, the four older children will equally inherit Murdoch’s voting shares in the trust, according to Alice Enders, head of research at Enders Analysis.In addition to shares in News Corp and Fox, the trust also includes the Cruden family farm near Melbourne and Murdoch’s art collection, according to a January 2023 Financial Times report.Fox and News Corp have a dual-share system, with non-voting Class A shares and voting Class B shares. The shares in Fox and News Corp owned by Murdoch’s children through the trust are a combination of both classes of shares.“It’s not like a real succession scenario right now, this minute,” said Enders. “It’s more in the future I’d say.”(Reporting by Helen Coster in New York and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Stephen Coates and Marguerita Choy)]"
59,15e2fe8c-fe9a-3a3a-bc92-1cd847c6d1c1,NWS,2023-09-22,Rupert Murdoch's exit ends chapter for polarising figure in his native Australia,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rupert-murdochs-exit-ends-chapter-051229168.html,1695359549.0,STORY,"['FOXA', 'NWSA']","[By Byron KayeSYDNEY (Reuters) - For some Australians, Rupert Murdoch's exit from the leadership of his media empire was a time to reflect on the country's greatest business success story.For others, it was a welcome reduction of influence for a man they viewed as a danger to democracy, and indeed, the planet.But as the country that produced the most powerful modern media figure processed the news he was stepping down as chairman of Fox Corp and News Corp, a consensus view quickly formed that there would never be another like him.""For one bloke to lead the world's most powerful family, build a A$30 billion ($19 billion) family fortune, and influence global affairs for decades is extraordinary,"" said Stephen Mayne, a former News journalist turned shareholder activist who has grilled Murdoch about the company's dealings at 15 annual meetings since 1999.""Sadly, certainly in recent years, so much of that legacy has been toxic,"" added Mayne, citing Murdoch outlets' amplification of 2020 U.S. presidential election falsehoods and questioning of climate science, among other things.The populist conservative media empire which Murdoch built over seven decades from a single Adelaide newspaper spreads across three continents but its influence remains unrivalled in Australia, where some 60% of daily newspapers, including national broadsheet The Australian, are News Corp-owned.Even at a time when media consumption is splintering from traditional routes, particularly among younger people, Murdoch's influence is embedded in the country's information ecosystem because of its massive reach, media experts said.His local properties include Sky News Australia, a cable TV channel fashioned on the partisan style of U.S. network Fox News.""What you publish in the Australian gets a second bounce through Sky gets a third bounce through the state daily papers,"" said Shane Homan, head of Monash University's media, film and journalism school.Story continues""The Murdoch papers still have that key reach with working-class demographics that can still be influential,"" he said.That was why Australian politicians across the ideological spectrum continued to pursue friendly relationships with the company, unlike in other markets where left-leaning lawmakers were more likely to avoid it, Honan added.POLITICAL REACTIONFederal Treasurer Jim Chalmers, asked by the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) if Murdoch's newspapers had treated his left-leaning Labor party unfairly, said he wouldn't discuss ""whether or not I feel stories or coverage have been fair"".""The body of work is there for all to see,"" Chalmers told the broadcaster. ""He has been in lots of ways a controversial figure, but an influential figure too, and this is an end of an era at News.""Foreign Minister Penny Wong, asked by reporters in New York about Murdoch's exit, said ""any fair-minded observer might say that some of the papers might not exactly be cheerleaders of the Labor Party, but that's what happens in a democracy"".""I wish him well for his retirement,"" she added.Australian politicians no longer in office took a less measured approach. Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a moderate conservative, said ""the business pages will give him credit"" for the success of Fox and News Corp ""but he has done enormous damage to the democratic world"".""The anger-tainment ecosystem that Fox News, above all, has created in the U.S. has left America angrier and more divided than it's been at any time since the civil war,"" Turnbull told the ABC.Murdoch's exit cuts a native tie between News Corp and Fox Corp and Australia, where Murdoch was born. His son Lachlan Murdoch, who becomes sole chairman of News Corp and continues as chair and CEO of Fox, was born in Britain.However, Lachlan Murdoch, whose wife is Australian, continues to live in Sydney with his family and commute to the U.S. where the two companies are based, a spokesperson said.Australia, in return, continues to play an outsize role for Murdoch's companies.It was a campaign led by his Australian newspapers that prompted the country's government in 2021 to force tech giants Meta and Google owner Alphabet to pay media outlets for content displayed on their websites, since they attracted advertising dollars.The U.S. and Canada now plan similar laws.A year earlier, News Corp's coverage of devastating Australian bushfires questioned the role of global warming and drew a rebuke from Murdoch's other son, James Murdoch. He quit the company's board, citing disagreements over editorial content, a few months later.($1 = 1.5569 Australian dollars)(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Jamie Freed)]"

He felt the lot was the beating heart of the company on the West Coast, one steeped in Hollywood history. Besides, he sensed the Century City land would only grow in value, a belief that has proved true (it's worth billions).Now, the 52-year-old executive is firmly presiding over the empire his father built — encompassing the most influential conservative media institutions in America — from an office suite on the L.A. studio lot.Fox Corp. and News Corp. on Thursday announced Rupert Murdoch was stepping down from his executive role at the two media companies and that Lachlan would succeed him atop the two companies. The changes take effect in November.Lachlan Murdoch becomes the sole chairman of News Corp., the publishing company that owns the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, and executive chairman of Fox, the television arm that includes Fox News, Fox Sports and the Fox broadcast network. Because Lachlan Murdoch has been at the helm as Fox's chief executive since March 2019, and because he is exceedingly close to his father, analysts expect the son's strategy to largely reflect the father's.""Lachlan is probably the most aligned with his father in terms of politics and in terms of his vision of the business,"" Paul Verna, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, said. ""There's not a lot of daylight between the two men.""Story continuesLachlan Murdoch has previously said the political bent of Fox News, which has made the network a lightning rod, will remain.Fox documents from late 2020 and early 2021, revealed in the course of high-profile and devastating litigation, underscored the tight collaboration between the two Murdochs. The pair were involved in overseeing Fox News' coverage of President Trump and his false statements that the 2020 election was stolen from him, which proved costly for the company. In April, Fox agreed to pay $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems to avoid a trial over defamation claims.Documents in the case showed how the Murdochs and Fox News Media Chief Executive Suzanne Scott in November 2020 discussed ways to avoid further alienating viewers after Fox News made the early and accurate call that Arizona had tipped to then-candidate Joe Biden.The situation ""needs constant rebuilding without any missteps,” Lachlan Murdoch wrote, according to the internal documents, referring to the company's effort to regain trust among Fox News fans.Read more: Murdoch has survived scandal after scandal. Will Dominion-Fox News lawsuit be different?But there are differences between the pair, beyond the generational gap.In fact, for a while, Lachlan Murdoch appeared uninterested in working with his father — at a time when his younger brother James dived into his corporate role with relish. Back then, it looked like James was in line for the throne.Rupert Murdoch has long made clear that one of his two sons would ultimately succeed him. Beyond wanting to keep his business in the family, the elder mogul is known among friends for his lack of sentimentality, buying and discarding properties that he once coveted, including the Hollywood movie studio known for ""Avatar"" and ""Titanic,"" DirecTV and the European satellite television service Sky.When he was CEO, he worked in an expansive office on the fifth floor of a modern office building on the lot.In contrast, Lachlan prefers the ground-floor office of the Depression-era Art Deco structure, Building 88 on Fox's Avenue of the Palms, where movie pioneer Darryl F. Zanuck once ran the show. Inside his office, a bank of TV screens flicker with Fox News and other channels. Editions of the company's newspapers are proudly and neatly displayed nearby.Lachlan Murdoch and Rupert Murdoch watch the U.S. Open tennis championships in 2018. (Adrian Edwards / GC Images)Lachlan Murdoch is fulfilling the career trajectory that his father mapped for him. Just as Rupert Murdoch had done seven decades before, after his father — a respected Australian news editor and former war correspondent Sir Keith Murdoch — died when Rupert was in his early 20s and left him a small Australian publishing company.""My father firmly believed in freedom, and Lachlan is absolutely committed to the cause,"" Rupert Murdoch wrote in a letter to the staffs of the two companies.Murdoch's message reads, in many ways, like a rallying call to his troops against so-called elites. The elder mogul has long seen himself as a provocateur, chiding news organizations he viewed as too bloated, too high-brow and too liberal.For decades, Rupert Murdoch has fashioned himself as a counterbalance to the media establishment. He's never shied away from using his outlets to influence politics and governments — in his native Australia, Britain and the U.S.""The battle for the freedom of speech and, ultimately, the freedom of thought, has never been more intense,"" Rupert Murdoch wrote in his letter. ""Elites have open contempt for those who are not members of their rarefied class. Most of the media is in cahoots with those elites, peddling political narratives rather than pursuing the truth.""Read more: Fox oral history: Inside the legendary studio at the end of its runIn some ways, Murdoch's letter also felt like a mandate to preserve his legacy.There have been tensions within family, and the succession battle that played out behind the scenes was intense at times, providing fodder for HBO's fictional drama, ""Succession."" Some observers have openly wondered whether the final episodes of the real-life Murdoch succession saga have truly been written yet.Although the elder mogul is pulling back from executive responsibilities at News Corp. and Fox, segueing into chairman emeritus, he retains the family's controlling voting shares of the two companies through a family trust, according to regulatory filings. Rupert Murdoch has the voting control of the trust, through its investment vehicle.Control of the trust will be passed to his four oldest children — Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James — after Murdoch dies. They will each have voting shares. Murdoch's two daughters from his marriage to Wendi Deng each have a financial stake, but not voting shares.The siblings, particularly Lachlan and James, haven't always been aligned in business priorities or in politics.James Murdoch served as chief executive of 21st Century Fox until its 2019 sale to the Walt Disney Co. After working 23 years in the family enterprise, he no longer had an executive role. Three years ago, James stepped down from News Corp.'s board, citing ""disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.""Read more: Legendary Fox Studio Lot set for $1.5-billion expansion For much of the last decade, Rupert Murdoch has been intent on entrusting Lachlan with the enterprise.After he graduated from Princeton, the London-born Lachlan joined the family business in Australia, working at some of their newspapers. Within a few years, he was scaling the ladder at the company in the U.S.In 1999, he was named head of the printing operations in the U.S. and served for a time as publisher of the New York Post during 9/11.He abruptly resigned in 2005, after souring on the corporate politics and moved with his wife, Sarah, and their children back to Australia to build his own profile in media there.In 2015, at his father's urging, Lachlan returned to the U.S. to work alongside him in the company.Fox credits Lachlan Murdoch with savvy business moves, including initially making an $11-million investment in the Australian real estate insights company, REA Group, in which News Corp. now has a majority stake. The publicly traded firm is now worth $8 billion, and News Corp. has a 61% stake.While running Fox in 2020, Lachlan Murdoch championed the $440-million acquisition of Tubi, a free advertising-supported television streaming service, which is now one of the most popular in the country. This year, Bloomberg News reported that Murdoch turned down unsolicited offers of more than $2 billion for the service.But the media landscape is particularly challenged, and it will be up to Lachlan Murdoch to steer the enterprise through those difficulties, including cord-cutting and declining ratings for linear television.""The changes the media industry has been through, and will continue to go through, are monumental,"" Verna said. ""The biggest one is how do you monetize streaming as the cable bundle erodes? That's not a small challenge, but it will be one that Lachlan will face.""Sign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.

65,0b4c6c8b-e35f-37b1-9e88-3ff0e68f84ed,MSI,2023-09-22,3 Wireless Stocks Likely to Excel on Solid Sector Dynamics,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-wireless-stocks-likely-excel-124200346.html,1695300120,STORY,"['MSI', '^GSPC', 'AVNW']","[The Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is expected to capitalize on the healthy demand trends backed by an accelerated pace of 5G deployment and fiber network infrastructure upgrade. However, large-scale investments for seamless 5G transition, margin erosion due to price wars, higher customer inventory levels and inflated raw material costs amid a challenging macroeconomic environment and uncertain business conditions might erode profitability.Nevertheless, Motorola Solutions, Inc. MSI, Ubiquiti Inc. UI and Aviat Networks, Inc. AVNW are likely to profit from the strong industry dynamics driven by a vast proliferation of IoT, rapid fiber densification and a gradual shift to cloud services.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry primarily comprises companies providing various networking solutions, wireless telecom products and related services for wireless voice and data communications through scalable modular platforms. Their product portfolio encompasses integrated circuit devices (chips) and system software for wireless voice and data communications, analog and digital two-way radio, satellite telecommunications, wireless networking and signal processing, and end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions. The firms also provide a broad range of routing, switching and security products, video surveillance and machine-to-machine communication components that secure VPN appliances, enable intrusion detection and thwart data theft. Some firms even provide electronic warfare, avionics, robotics, advanced communications and maritime systems to the defense industry.What's Shaping the Future of the Wireless Equipment Industry?Focus on Demand-Driven Operations: With the exponential growth of mobile broadband traffic and home Internet solutions, demand for advanced networking architecture has increased manifold. This has forced service providers to spend more on routers and switches to upgrade their networks and support the surge in home data traffic. Moreover, a faster pace of 5G deployment is expected to augment the telecommunications industry's scalability, security and universal mobility and propel the wide proliferation of IoT. Expansion of fiber optic networks by carriers to support their 4G LTE and 5G wireless standards, as well as wireline connections, are likely to act as tailwinds. The fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and the last mile local loop, which are required by wireless service providers for 5G deployment. Fiber networks are also essential for the growing deployment of small cells that bring the network closer to the user and supplement macro networks to provide extensive coverage. The industry participants are facilitating its customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations and seamlessly migrate to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation through steady infrastructure investments.Margin Woes Persist: Although higher infrastructure investments will eventually help minimize service delivery costs to support broadband competition and wireless densification, short-term profitability has largely been compromised. Margins are likely to be affected by the high cost of first-generation 5G products, profitability challenges in China, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and pricing pressure in early 5G deals. Uncertainty regarding chip shortage and supply-chain disruptions leading to a dearth of essential fiber materials, shipping delays and shortages of other raw materials are expected to affect the expansion and rollout of new broadband networks. Extended lead times for basic components are also likely to hurt the delivery schedule and escalate production costs. Further, the high technological obsolescence of most products has escalated operating costs with steady investments in R&amp;D. High customer inventory levels, owing to intense market volatility, pose another headwind for the companies.Cloud Networking Thrust: The majority of the industry participants offer mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software and services that enable its customers to run businesses with increased efficiency and safety for their mobile workforce. These systems drive demand for additional device sales, software upgrades, infrastructure overhaul and expansion, as well as additional services to maintain, monitor and manage these complex networks and solutions. The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks for constant critical communication operations. The wide proliferation of cloud networking solutions is further resulting in increased storage and computing on a virtual plane. As both consumers and enterprises use the network, there is tremendous demand for quality networking equipment.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish ProspectsThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector.

The two companies first agreed to their deal in January 2022.On Tuesday, the CMA said in a press release that Microsoft's concession ""substantially addresses previous concerns and opens the door to the deal being cleared.""One CMA official said in the release that ""this is a new and substantially different deal, which keeps the cloud distribution of these important games in the hands of a strong independent supplier, Ubisoft, rather than under the control of Microsoft.""However, the CMA said it had identified ""limited residual concerns"" in the proposal, in that certain provisions could be circumvented, terminated, or not enforced.Microsoft's proposed remedies should address those issues, the agency said. It is now consulting on the proposed remedies before it makes a final decision.""We are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process,"" Brad Smith, Microsoft’s vice chair and president, said.""We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18 deadline.""Story continuesMicrosoft previously faced regulatory scrutiny in the US, as well. But in July, the Federal Trade Commission withdrew its challenge of the acquisition, leaving CMA as the only competition authority standing in the way of the deal.Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick praised the CMA's move forward in a statement, saying: ""This is a significant milestone for the merger and a testament to our solutions-oriented work with regulators. I remain optimistic as we continue the journey toward completion and am very grateful to each of you for your dedication and focus throughout this process.""The US agency dropped the challenge based on a federal appeals court that denied its request to temporarily stop the deal from closing.Click here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8.94% and reach $376.08 billion by 2028. The projected rise can be credited to widespread gaming culture and increased accessibility to the internet and digital devices.The gaming industry is one of the most multifaceted and ever-evolving industries that has been keeping people hooked and entertained regardless of their age for decades. However, the gaming industry has seen periods of slow and stagnated growth. Soon after the popularity of arcade games in the 1970s, the market seemed to have crashed. However, the market later gained its status back with the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis, leading to a rise in the popularity of gaming consoles.The pandemic also fueled the growth of the gaming market. Gaming became one of the major forms of entertainment for people to have some sense of relief amid global lockdowns. While many markets were crashing because of COVID-19, the gaming market seemed to remain robust and even grow during that period. Video gaming trends experienced a massive surge in traffic and revenue during the lockdown period as reported by Mordor Intelligence.Technological advancements are also playing a significant role in the growth of the gaming market. It is not only making the gaming experience better but is also a very strong standout point in terms of marketing.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Signet Jewelers' (NYSE:SIG) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Signet Jewelers is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$662m ÷ (US$6.1b - US$1.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).So, Signet Jewelers has an ROCE of 16%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 13% generated by the Specialty Retail industry. Check out our latest analysis for Signet Jewelers roceIn the above chart we have measured Signet Jewelers' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Signet Jewelers' ROCE Trending?Signet Jewelers has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 31% over the last five years. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn summary, we're delighted to see that Signet Jewelers has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 26% to shareholders. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.Like most companies, Signet Jewelers does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.While Signet Jewelers may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The company's ROCE for the trailing twelve months to July 2023 stands at 16%, calculated as Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) divided by (Total Assets - Current Liabilities). This equates to US$662m divided by (US$6.1b - US$1.9b).While an ROCE of 16% aligns closely with the industry average of 13%, it represents a significant improvement for Signet Jewelers. Over the past five years, the company's ROCE has grown by 31%, despite the capital employed in the business remaining relatively stable. This suggests that Signet is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital, a clear indication of increased operational efficiency.Firms that consistently reinvest their earnings at increasing rates of return are often classified as 'compounding machines'. Given Signet Jewelers' ability to continually augment its returns on capital without substantial increases in capital investment, this label appears fitting for the company.Although details about future growth plans and analyst forecasts for the company are available, they were not disclosed in this report.

WBA division Walgreens and AllianceRx Walgreens Pharmacy recently conducted a retrospective cohort study assessing the use of non-infused biologics in patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The research findings highlight the importance of patients remaining adherent to their therapy.According to the study, individuals taking their non-infused RA biologic treatment as prescribed are more likely to experience fewer medical expenses, a lower risk of hospitalization and a shorter stay (LOS).An autoimmune and inflammatory condition known as rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the immune system mistakenly assaults healthy cells, leading to inflammation (painful swelling), which most frequently affects the hands, wrists, and knees.Study DetailsFor the study, researchers consulted the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters and Supplemental or Coordination of Benefits databases from 2019 to 2020. They looked at three different annual outcomes for each patient, the total cost of care, any hospitalizations during the year, and the total length of stay (LOS) for each hospitalization episode.The proportion of days covered (PDC) for non-infused biologic drugs to treat RA is a helpful reporting metric promoted by the Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA). The PDC-RA metric is used. The study aimed to find statistically significant relationships between this PQA PDC adherence parameter and LOS, hospitalizations and overall medical expenditures for RA patients.Significance of Study FindingsAfter adjusting for numerous other factors affecting these results, the study demonstrates that adherence to a non-infused RA biologic can result in lower medical expenses, chances of hospitalization, and LOS. The findings also validate the PDC-RA technique for determining adherence rates for reporting requirements.The likelihood that a patient's disease will improve can be increased by identifying adherence hurdles and teaching patients the value of taking their medication. A specialized chemist can be crucial in helping patients manage their illness, whether by assisting them in taking their prescriptions properly or alerting their prescriber about a new adverse event.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report, the global rheumatoid arthritis drugs market size was valued at $60.1 billion in 2021 and is expected to surpass $70.1 billion by 2030, registering a CAGR of 1.75%. The market is projected to grow at a significant rate due to growing cases of rheumatoid arthritis.Progress within Walgreens Pharmacy BusinessIn April 2023, Walgreens partnered with the Dublin-based biotech company Prothena Corporation. The collaboration aims to accelerate patient identification and recruitment for Prothena’s ongoing ASCENT-2 multiple ascending dose clinical trial. Through its trusted community pharmacy presence and interactions with patients across the United States, Walgreens expects to play a significant role in helping Prothena with its clinical trial recruitment efforts.The same month, Walgreens and AllianceRx Walgreens Pharmacy conducted a study assessing the value of a specialty pharmacy order review program, revealing that the program prevented waste for those who received injectable fertility medications, helping to positively impact patient adherence and outcomes.  The study findings demonstrated high patient satisfaction and cost savings.Price PerformanceIn the past year, WBA shares have declined 34.5% against the industry’s rise of 30.5%.Zacks Rank and Key PicksWalgreens Boots Alliance currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

However, the companies' differing financial situations and growth strategies present distinct opportunities and risks for dividend investors.On Thursday, Walgreens' stock yield stood at 8.6%, significantly higher than the S&amp;P 500's payout of less than 1.6%. To generate a $1,000 dividend, an investment of approximately $11,600 in Walgreens stock would be required. The company has a long-standing history of consistent payouts, having increased its dividends for decades and maintained payments for over 90 years.Despite this, investors have shown bearish sentiment towards the company due to deteriorating earnings, the recent departure of its CEO, and lowered guidance for the year. The stock has dropped more than 40% this year. Nevertheless, Walgreens still projects adjusted earnings per share of at least $4 for the current fiscal year, implying a payout ratio of less than 50%.The company is heavily investing in primary care to enhance growth prospects and recently raised projections for its transformational cost savings program from $3.5 billion to $4.1 billion. Despite the challenges it faces, Walgreens' low trading multiple of less than six times its estimated future earnings provides a margin of safety that could make it an appealing contrarian buy.In contrast, CVS Health offers a smaller dividend yield of 3.5%, requiring an investment of close to $28,600 to earn $1,000 in dividend income. However, with $17.7 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months against dividend payments costing just $3 billion during that period, CVS has ample room to maintain or even increase its dividends.CVS's recent acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health further diversify and expand its long-term growth opportunities. While Walgreens has struggled with cash flow, CVS has demonstrated more generous rate increases over the past decade. With strong free cash flow to support future growth and dividends, CVS offers a blend of income and growth potential. At eight times its expected future profits, CVS also presents a relatively cheap investment opportunity.Story continuesHigh-yielding dividend stocks can be attractive, but the risk lies in investing solely for the payout. If a company slashes its dividend, the incentive to hold the stock could evaporate. In this comparison, CVS appears to be the more stable business with better growth prospects than Walgreens. Despite Walgreens' higher yield, its poor cash flow and the need for continued funding of its healthcare business could strain operations and potentially lead to changes in dividend policy. CVS, with its solid valuation, robust growth potential, and strong free cash flow, could offer higher recurring income in the future.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

(NASDAQ:PAYX) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Paychex The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.05bUS$2.05bUS$2.26bUS$2.46bUS$2.62bUS$2.74bUS$2.85bUS$2.94bUS$3.03bUS$3.11bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.62%Est @ 3.88%Est @ 3.36%Est @ 3.00%Est @ 2.74% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.9kUS$1.9kUS$1.9kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.1b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.2%) = US$71bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$71b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$38bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$56b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$116, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 25% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Paychex as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.890. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for PaychexStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Professional Services market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Paychex, we've put together three fundamental elements you should look at:Risks: Be aware that  Paychex is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Future Earnings: How does PAYX's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

However, a deeper analysis is required to establish the feasibility of investing in the stock at $95 per share.Let's traverse into a more detailed discussion about Starbucks Corp's (NASDAQ:SBUX) dividend increase and quantify whether value exists.Latest earnings and subsequent dividend increaseWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with SBUX. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?Starbucks Corp's (NASDAQ:SBUX) latest dividend increase amounts to a 7.5% quarter-on-quarter increase, which presents little surprise as the company's compound annual dividend growth rate for the past 14 years amounts to 20%. However, it should be considered that companies often determine their dividend policies based on their expected financial performance; as such, Starbucks Corp's (NASDAQ:SBUX) latest dividend increase suggests its board believes the firm's prospective operating results will be robust.As Assessment of Starbucks' Dividend IncreaseTrivially speaking, in order to pay sustainable dividends, a company must generate sufficient profits, and Starbucks Corp's (NASDAQ:SBUX) third-quarter financial results convey just that.Record Revenues and Profit MarginsAccording to its latest results, Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) achieved record revenues amounting to $9.2 billion, which is a 12% year-on-year increase. Much of the company's fundamental support derived from its international markets segment, as its same-store sales surged by 24%. Additionally, Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) achieved a quarterly operating profit margin of 17.4%, trumping the 16.9% it produced in the prior year.Story continuesAs Assessment of Starbucks' Dividend IncreaseSource: Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) (third-quarter results)Concerns about Performance in ChinaAlthough the company's firm-wide performance is superb, many are worried about its lagging performance in China. In fact, Andrew Charles of Cowen recently opined on the matter, stating: ""While we forecast consensus 2023-25E EPS is achievable, in our view the multiple isn't discounted enough vs the 5Y avg that leads us to expect shares will be in a holding pattern,""In my view, investors are overzealous regarding headwinds from China. Sure, political issues coupled with interim economic stagnation are not beneficial to Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX). However, exposure to China is part of a long-term growth strategy with secular growth central to most companies' rationale; moreover, unstable political issues within the region are part and parcel of expanding into an emerging market.To summarize this sub-section, it can be reasonably stated that Starbucks Corp's (NASDAQ:SBUX) fundamental attributes remain robust, acting against the grain of the economic headwinds embedded within 2023's economy.

The company raised its quarterly dividend by 7.5% to 57 cents per share. This will be paid on Nov 24 to its shareholders on record as of Nov 10.Following the hike, SBUX’s new annualized dividend amounted to $2.28 per share, giving a yield of 2.4%. In 2022, it lifted its dividend by 8.2%. SBUX’s payout ratio is 64, with a five-year dividend growth rate of more than 9.7%.Along with boosting returns for shareholders, dividend hike elevates a stock's market value. Therefore, companies frequently employ this strategy to draw in new investors and maintain loyalty of existing ones.We commend Starbucks for its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholders’ returns, even in the face of widespread inflation, which continues to impact numerous industries. These actions underscore the company's robust business position and resilience of its cash flow.Ever since management initiated dividend in 2010, SBUX has been uplifting it in each of the previous 13 years. Starbucks is one of the most recognized coffee brands in the world. From espresso to specialty roast and ground coffee to premium single-serve market, it commands authority and a leading position in all coffee segments.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStock PerformanceSo far this year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 12.3% compared with the industry’s 10.2% growth.Improving customer experience with innovative new store designs and upgraded product offerings, and supply-chain efficiencies bode well.

These factors are likely to impede its performance in the quarters ahead.The Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) player has a market capitalization of $35.6 billion. In the past six months, the stock has lost 4.7% compared with the industry’s 4.4% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s discuss the factors that might continue taking a toll on the firm.Weak Industry Trend: Sysco has been witnessing slower overall industry market volume growth due to the inflationary environment and rising interest rates. Although Sysco’s size and scale advantages and solid balance sheet position it for growth in fiscal 2024, the company anticipates the market to grow at a lower rate than in fiscal 2023. This is expected to put pressure on the company’s volumes, which might adversely impact its top-line performance.High Operating Costs and Expenses: The company has been subject to product cost inflation in the U.S. Foodservice unit over the past few quarters. For instance, the company witnessed product cost inflation of 4.9% and 2.1% in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2023, respectively. The metric is measured by estimated changes in product costs, mainly in the frozen, canned and dry categories. In the fiscal fourth quarter, its operating expenses rose by 1.9% year-over-year.In fiscal 2023, Sysco’s cost of sales and operating expenses increased by 10.8% and 9%, respectively. The company expects its International segment to remain inflationary in fiscal 2024. A rise in operating costs and expenses, if not controlled, might affect SYY’s margins and profitability in the coming quarters.High Tax Rate: For fiscal 2024, Sysco anticipates the tax rate to be approximately 24.5%, compared with 23% recorded in fiscal 2023. A higher tax rate might hurt the company’s bottom line in fiscal 2024.Foreign Exchange Headwinds: Sysco has been subject to unfavorable foreign currency movements, given its strong presence in international markets. In the fiscal fourth quarter, revenues from SYY’s International Foodservice operations accounted for 18.5% of its total revenues. However, in the quarter, foreign exchange headwinds adversely impacted the overall top line and gross profit by 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. A stronger U.S. dollar might further depress its overseas business results moving ahead.Estimate Revisions: In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised down by 3.8% and 3.3%, respectively.Story continuesSome Solid Staple BetsSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Inter Parfums IPAR, Helen of Troy HELE and Grocery Outlet GO.Inter Parfums, which manufactures, markets and distributes a range of fragrances and fragrance-related products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Inter Parfums’ current financial-year sales indicates 19.7% growth from the year-ago reported figure.

92,25cefd25-a6a4-39fc-b564-97b675135ff4,HST,2023-09-22,Here's Why You Should Retain Host Hotels (HST) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-host-hotels-173200811.html,1695317520,STORY,['HST'],"[Host Hotels &amp; Resorts HST is well-positioned to benefit from its portfolio of well-located properties in markets with strong demand drivers. Its capital-recycling efforts and a healthy balance sheet bode well for long-term growth. However, constrained business and group travel demand due to a cautious approach by many businesses may weigh on it. Elevated interest rates are also concerning.What’s Aiding it?Host Hotels enjoys a portfolio of luxury and upper-scale hotels across the top 20 lucrative U.S. markets, with a strong presence in the attractive Sunbelt region. These properties are strategically located in central business districts of major cities with close proximity to airports and resort/conference destinations and are likely to drive demand, poising HST well to ride the growth curve.The continued momentum in leisure travel demand and recovery in business transient and group demand from the initial days of the pandemic have aided occupancy and hotel revenue per available room (RevPAR) growth in recent quarters. From the beginning of 2023 through Jun 30, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 14.9% from the 2022 levels. Management expects the metric to grow between 7% and 9% in 2023. We expect it to exhibit year-over-year growth of 8.1% in the current year.Host Hotels has been undertaking strategic capital allocations to enhance the quality of its portfolio. HST has a greater scale and competitive advantage in the U.S. markets. The company has incurred $323 million of capital expenditure from the beginning of 2023 through Jun 30.It also completed the transformation of 16 hotels in the past couple of years as part of a transformational capital program led by Marriott to improve long-term performance through higher RevPAR. Management expects to incur capital expenditure of $625-$725 million this year.Moreover, this lodging real estate investment trust’s (REIT) capital-recycling efforts are encouraging. Over the years, HST has disposed of its non-strategic assets that have lower growth potential or properties with significant capital expenditures and redeployed the proceeds for investments in better-yielding assets. Such efforts highlight the company’s prudent capital-management practices and help preserve balance strength.Story continuesPer the company's August 2023 investor presentation, from 2021 to the end of the second quarter of 2023, its total disposition was around $1.5 billion, which is 17.5 times the EBITDA multiple, and its acquisitions were around $1.9 billion, which is 13.1 times the EBITDA multiple. Our estimate suggests an increase of 6.8% in EBITDA for 2023 on a year-over-year basis.HST maintains a healthy balance sheet and had $2.5 billion in total available liquidity as of Jun 30, 2023. It does not have any material debt maturities until April 2024. Moreover, it is the only company with an investment-grade rating among lodging REITs. It enjoyed ratings of Baa3 from Moody’s and BBB- from both Fitch and S&amp;P Global as of the second quarter of 2023, rendering it favorable access to the debt market. HST’s healthy financial position will aid it in capitalizing on long-term growth opportunities and facilitating redevelopment activities.Over the past six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 6.4% compared with the industry's upside of 1.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Hurting it?The recovery in business and group travel demand, although having picked up the pace since the start of the pandemic, is likely to be tepid in the near term, as businesses continue to adopt a cautious approach and delay the return to the offices. Moreover, given the present macroeconomic uncertainty, management expects its operations in specific markets to stay uneven in the near term. Against this backdrop, we expect adjusted funds from operations to exhibit moderate growth of 1.5% in 2023 on a year-over-year basis.Host Hotels faces competition from other owners and investors in upper upscale and luxury full-service hotels. Also, the growth of Internet reservation channels is likely to fuel competition, as more people are booking hotel rooms through the online mode. This may adversely impact the company's revenues and profitability. Further, the spike in online short-term rentals has escalated the supply in the lodging industry, leading to increased competition in some markets.Additionally, a high interest rate environment may lead to greater borrowing costs for the company, hampering its ability to acquire or develop real estate. We expect interest expenses to increase 21.8% in 2023 on a year-over-year basis.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Welltower WELL, SBA Communications SBAC and Americold Realty Trust COLD, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Users of the DAT network can now:Verify the identity of the entities they are doing business with.Ensure the legitimacy of load postings on the DAT load board.Monitor, detect and block fraud in real time.Leverage industry-leading DAT rules, signals and intelligence to identify signatures and block fraud.DAT’s AI-powered identity-verification solution is powered by Verosint and works in the background to maintain a secure and seamless login experience for legitimate users. It harnesses DAT’s expertise in data, analytics, and generative AI to detect potential fraudulent activity and stop unauthorized access to DAT One, the industry’s largest freight marketplace and analytics platform.Stephen Shoaff, CEO &amp; Co-founder of Verosint says: ""Identity based cyber crime is challenging all businesses and account fraud is a key enabler of these crimes. We are thrilled DAT chose our platform to monitor all identity transactions for real-time detection and prevention of fraud. Our combined expertise will deliver the industry’s highest protection against fraudulent identity events, setting what we believe to be a new standard.""The partnership is a significant step in DAT’s multifaceted fraud-prevention program announced earlier this year. The program includes:Predictive fraud detection, identity verification and multi-factor authentication to detect and stop suspicious logins.An expanded Network Integrity Unit (NIU) dedicated to investigating reports of fraud and maintaining DAT as the most trusted freight marketplace.Anti-fraud education and training for customers.Collaboration with customers and industry partners, law enforcement agencies and regulators in the fight against fraud.Story continuesLike so many other industries, the truckload freight market has been plagued by bad actors looking to exploit carriers, brokers and shippers with various identity theft scams. DAT reports that 56% of the fraud cases it investigates are identity-related, driven by account takeovers, credential stuffing, new-account fraud and synthetic (BOT) accounts.Without sophisticated identity verification to detect and preempt potential fraud at scale, operators of online freight networks have to investigate reports of suspicious activity individually, a laborious manual process. This AI and Machine Language-based innovation enables DAT to intervene swiftly and selectively, enhancing its ability to prevent fraud activity before it happens.Mac Pinkerton, President of North American Surface Transportation at C.H. Robinson said: ""Automated identity verification is a game-changer. The ability to automatically detect and stop cybercriminals in real-time is crucial to a more secure freight marketplace and a testament to DAT’s commitment to fighting fraud.""""Ensuring a safe, secure and scalable network for our customers is DAT’s top priority,"" said Satish Maripuri, CEO &amp; President at DAT.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about HCA Healthcare (HCA).HCA currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.40, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 20 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.40 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 20 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 15 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 75% and 10% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for HCABroker Rating Breakdown Chart for HCACheck price target &amp; stock forecast for HCA here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying HCA, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in HCA?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for HCA, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $18.47.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for HCA.

Market participants were widely expecting a status quo. However, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell destroyed the initial enthusiasm of investors.Consequently, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — slid 0.2%, 0.9% and 1.5%, respectively. The small-cap benchmark — the Russell 2000 — also declined 0.9%.More Interest Rate Hike LikelyAlthough the Fed paused rate hike in the September FOMC meeting, the current dot-plot has shown a strong likelihood of one more hike of 25 basis points in 2023. That will take the terminal interest rate of this hiking cycle to 5.6%, well above the 5.1% forecast in June. Notably, the current range of the Fed fund rate is the highest level since March 2001.More importantly, the central bank said it would keep higher interest rates for a longer time period. The new projection has shown two rate cuts in 2024 instead of four projected in June. The Fed expects the U.S. economy to grow at a healthy 2.1% in 2023 and the core PCE price index — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — to stay at 3.7% this year, well above its 2% target level. Strong GDP growth rate and stubborn inflation compel the central bank to continue restrictive monetary policies for a longer period.Powell said, “We’re in a position to proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming.” However, he also said, “We want to see convincing evidence really that we have reached the appropriate level, and we’re seeing progress and we welcome that. But, you know, we need to see more progress before we’ll be willing to reach that conclusion.”At this stage, it should be prudent to stay safe as volatile trading pattern that we are witnessing in the past one and a half months may continue in the fourth quarter of 2023.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five stocks from defensive sectors like utilities, consumer staples and healthcare.

The Federal Reserve's job is to help curb that inflation, but these levels haven't been seen in quite some time. Truist Chief Market Strategist Keith Lerner joins Yahoo Finance to discuss how the central bank still has work to do to accomplish its missionLerner explains that the Fed has been forced to shift their strategy, saying ""this is the first time they've [the Federal Reserve] had to deal with inflation for over 20 years, they're going to be much more gradual in shift in their position, we saw that reflected in the statement from yesterday.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, the federal reserve decided to hold rates steady at yesterday's meeting, making it clear the central bank is almost done raising rates. But with inflation still sticky, next year could see fewer cuts than previously indicated. Our next guest says the Fed is far from mission accomplished, and the market consensus is expecting too many rate cuts.Joining us now is Keith Lerner, Truist Chief Market Strategist. Good to have you back on the show here, Keith. So in terms of what we thought was going to happen, in terms of pricing and what some of the markets clearly thought were going to be, some cuts we were going to see this year, now those projections being pushed out to 2024, how is the sentiment here? How accurate are the markets getting this story right now?KEITH LERNER: Yeah. Well, great to be with you, Rachelle. Wish we had a better, you know, day as far as markets because we are all under pressure today. And I think the market has taken this as a negative. And I think our view for some time for this year is that this inflation battle over the last year has caused a shift in the reaction function from the Fed.They have scar tissue, meaning this is the first time they've had to deal with inflation for over 20 years, and that they're going to be much more gradual in shifting their position. And we saw that reflected in the statement yesterday. And I think really the key today, you know, when we have these Fed meetings, what I really look at is, how is the market reacting?Story continuesAnd I will say, really, what's pressuring markets more than anything today, to me, is the risk-free rate. The 10-year treasury just broke out of the range that it's been in for several months and above the highs from last October. And I think that's why you're seeing pressure across the capital markets today.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So then as you look at what's happening with yields, what is that signaling about some of the sectors that perhaps could be leading the way and how people are trying to really play this period right now?KEITH LERNER: Yeah. I think one thing that was a challenge right now is there's no sector leadership. Energy had been the sector leadership, and I still think that looks relatively attractive. But that's even given it back. So at this point, we're waiting for like the real sector leadership to stand up. But I will say the way we've been thinking about this is you want to stay away or have less exposure to more of the interest rate-sensitive areas of the market.So what do I mean by that? Well, one, think about small caps. They're really cheap. However, they have about three times the floating rate debt relative to large caps. And what are we seeing today? Small caps breaking down. Real estate, as we have more of that refinancing happening, they're going to be impacted by higher for longer as well. So you want to kind of stay away from some of those areas.And then as I mentioned, I mean, we're still waiting for the new leadership to emerge. But in the interim, we still like areas like communication services, we still like industrials. But it's a really mixed overall market right now. And I think we're in the seasonal weak period where I think we have more of these choppy waters to go.]"

An ABR of 1.72 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 18 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy and one is Buy.

As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias.

However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexRSPF is managed by Invesco, and this fund has amassed over $254.44 million, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Financials ETFs. RSPF, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the S&amp;P 500 EQUAL WEIGHT FINANCIALS INDEX .The S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Financials Index equally weights stocks in the financial sector of the S&amp;P 500 Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.40% for RSPF, making it on par with most peer products in the space.Story continuesIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.33%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector - about 100% of the portfolio.Looking at individual holdings, Global Payments Inc (GPN) accounts for about 1.66% of total assets, followed by Metlife Inc (MET) and Brown &amp; Brown Inc (BRO).The top 10 holdings account for about 15.42% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF has gained about 2.39% so far, and it's up approximately 0% over the last 12 months (as of 09/22/2023). RSPF has traded between $49.76 and $54.83 in this past 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 1.08. With about 73 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesInvesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Financials ETF is not a suitable option for investors seeking to outperform the Financials ETFs segment of the market.

Earnings estimates for 2023 have moved north from $1.16 per share to $1.19 per share, over the past 60 days. The company is benefiting from increased demand for Hot Wheels, the launch of new products aligned with the Barbie movie and the execution of its IP-driven toy business strategy.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is facing headwinds in the form of macroeconomic uncertainties and an ongoing inflationary environment.Factors That Make the Stock AppealingDiverse Product Portfolio: Mattel benefits from a robust assortment of products encompassing core brands, licensed brands and profitable product affiliations. Brands like Hot Wheels, which accumulate a notable share of popularity, have been the category leader in multiple product segments of the company for several years. During the second quarter of 2023, gross billings at the Hot Wheels brand rose 10% (on a reported basis) and 9% (at constant currency) to $315.2 million, year over year. The company has been witnessing an improving sales trend for Hot Wheels and is quite confident about the brand’s long-term prospects. Moreover, its initiatives of product portfolio expansion, along with other digital expansions, add to the growth trend.Apart from Hot Wheels, MAT’s multi-year global licensing agreement with Disney has enabled it to lay down a variety of products, including Princess and Frozen branded line of products. This has driven the company’s second-quarter results and is consistently building momentum along with Monster High. Also, the company’s launch of a variety of toys and products related to the Barbie movie has created demand in the market, being sold out across major distribution channels from release to date. Furthermore, on Jul 25, 2023, the company renewed its multi-category licensing partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer Products. The product lines will include the DC Universe, Bat Wheels and Harry Potter, Fantastic Beasts, FRIENDS, among others.Optimizing for Growth Program: MAT’s initiation of a new multi-year program, Optimizing for Growth, in 2021 has contributed about $106 million of incremental savings in the cost of goods in 2022. In the second quarter of 2023, the company generated $24 million in savings through the execution of the Optimizing for Growth program. The company is on track for the program to deliver its savings goal of $300 million by 2023. Through the cost-saving program, it remains focused on achieving cumulative cost savings, thus, enhancing margins.IP-Driven Business Strategy: Mattel continues to make progress toward capturing the full value of its IP and transforming itself into a high-performing toy company. Moreover, it is strengthening its partnership with major entertainment companies, including Microsoft, Nickelodeon, Nintendo, Universal, Warner Bros and WWE. Moreover, the company stated progress on capturing the full value of its IP in its business verticals outside of the toy aisle. Its collaboration with Pokémon company and new multiyear agreement with Netflix for exclusive content, including three original, are just some of the strategies undertaken to expand the reach of the IP business strategy.Mattel Creations continues to gain momentum by targeting the collector market (with new products) and international expansion efforts. In the second quarter of 2023, the company was able to successfully execute its strategy to expand its IP-driven toy business and entertainment offering.Story continuesFactors That Hinder GrowthMacroeconomic Uncertainty: Mattel is currently operating in an uncertain macro economy, which is much likely to impact its consumer demand. It remains cautious of the current scenario and owing to this, the company mostly reduced its 2023 guidance compared with the reported 2022 results.Increased Inflation: MAT witnessed cost inflation and an unfavorable fixed cost absorption, along with inventory management costs, including higher close-out sales and inventory obsolescence expenses during the second quarter of 2023. It believes that this scenario is likely to continue for some time.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Discretionary sector are Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

Nearing October, studios fear losing more money over the lack of scripted content. But, now a new deal is potentially on the table, CNBC reports, in ongoing talks between WGA leadership and major media executives. Could a deal be reached as soon as the end of the day?Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita breaks down the benefits packages and job security guarantees featured in writers' demands, including protections from future incorporations of AI, and what studio execs have already agreed to.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: The writers and actors have been striking against Hollywood executives and studios for over 100 days. According to reports, meetings on Wednesday were attended by Disney CEO Bob Iger, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos, and Comcast Chairman Donna Langley. Both sides are expected to meet again today to continue those discussions with sources telling CNBC's David Faber that the talks may be nearing the end now. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita to give us some more details here. Hey, Akiko.AKIKO FUJITA: Hey there, Brad. Well, you talked about those four CEOs being in the room yesterday. They are expected to be back at the table today. That is certainly critical and points to potential movements on the front in terms of negotiations partly because that hasn't happened until now.As you noted, CNBC now reporting that a deal is close and could potentially be finalized by the end of the day today. The two sides, though, releasing a rare joint statement late Wednesday saying the WGA and AMPTP met for bargaining today and will meet again tomorrow. Now, the key issues on the table still remain the same.We're talking about writers specifically seeking residuals that would be tied to the number of views their episodes get on a streaming service as opposed to the number of episodes. They're also seeking a mandatory minimum level for the number of writers that are in the room in TV. Of course, protection from content related to artificial intelligence certainly on the table as well.Story continuesNow, there are still a part on these issue. But there's been a sense over the last several weeks that these two sides, at least the divide is starting to narrow. For example, the studios have agreed to guarantee that writers will not lose out on credit or pay if they use artificial intelligence to help write their scripts.The studios have also proposed to allow showrunners to hire at least two writers per show, still different from what the WGA is asking for, but shows some movement there. And the studios have not budged on the issue of residuals, but they have agreed to at least share some viewership data with the union.Now, we're talking about potential movement here in negotiations because there is a renewed sense of urgency between these two sides largely because October has for a while been seen as kind of an artificial deadline on the table. For one, the studios look at more than 140 days into this strike. This is kind of the time they have seen that writers have started to really feel the financial pain. They believe they have some leverage on that front.For the writers, at least behind the scenes, there has been pressure building on the WGA to come to an agreement by October. So this year is not awash. And the fear is that if this goes past October that this could be done in terms of content for the year. So we'll be watching any developments coming out of LA today. We do know that both sides are meeting again. Will there be a deal at the end of the day? Still to be determined, but we'll be watching that one closely, guys.]"

The two parties are scheduled to meet again on the same day, with hopes high for a resolution.The dispute, which was initiated on May 2, 2023, has led to a significant halt in the production of television shows and movies. High-profile projects such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s Stranger Things, Disney's Blade, and Paramount's Evil have been notably affected by the work stoppages resulting from the strike.The main point of contention in this dispute lies in the writers' demand for improved compensation. They argue that their current earnings do not adequately reflect the substantial revenue generated from streaming services.Since the inception of the strike, studios have managed to save money due to halted productions. However, executives have warned that the absence of new content could eventually impact profits. This situation has raised concerns about potential financial implications if the dispute continues unresolved.Both sides involved in this conflict have expressed a strong desire to reach an agreement soon. However, if no consensus is reached, there could be a potential extension of this industrial action until the end of 2023, as reported by CNBC.For additional information on this developing story, Brian Swint can be contacted at brian.swint@barrons.com.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

A few compounds picked by AI are now in development, but those bets will take years to play out.Reuters interviews with more than a dozen pharmaceutical company executives, drug regulators, public health experts and AI firms show, however, that the technology is playing a sizeable and growing role in human drug trials.Companies such as Amgen, Bayer and Novartis are training AI to scan billions of public health records, prescription data, medical insurance claims and their internal data to find trial patients - in some cases halving the time it takes to sign them up.""I don't think it's pervasive yet,"" said Jeffrey Morgan, managing director at Deloitte, which advises the life sciences industry. ""But I think we're past the experimentation stage.""The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it had received about 300 applications that incorporate AI or machine learning in drug development from 2016 through 2022. Over 90% of those applications came in the past two years and most were for the use of AI at some point in the clinical development stage.ATOMIC AIBefore AI, Amgen would spend months sending surveys to doctors from Johannesburg to Texas to ask whether a clinic or hospital had patients with relevant clinical and demographic characteristics to participate in a trial.Story continuesExisting relationships with facilities or doctors would often sway the decision on which trial sites are selected.However, Deloitte estimates about 80% of studies miss their recruitment targets because clinics and hospitals overestimate the number of available patients, there are high dropout rates or patients don't adhere to trial protocols.Amgen's AI tool, ATOMIC, scans troves of internal and public data to identify and rank clinics and doctors based on past performance in recruiting patients for trials.Enrolling patients for a mid-stage trial could take up to 18 months, depending on the disease, but ATOMIC can cut that in half in the best-case scenario, Amgen told Reuters.Amgen has used ATOMIC in a handful of trials testing drugs for conditions including cardiovascular disease and cancer, and aims to use it for most studies by 2024.The company said by 2030, it expects AI will have helped it shave two years off the decade or more it typically takes to develop a drug.The AI tool Novartis uses has also made enrolling patients in trials faster, cheaper and more efficient, said Badhri Srinivasan, its head of global development operations. But he said AI in this context is only as good as the data it gets.In general, less than 25% of health data is publicly available for research, according to Sameer Pujari, an AI expert at the World Health Organization.EXTERNAL CONTROL ARMSGerman drugmaker Bayer said it used AI to cut the number of participants needed by several thousand for a late-stage trial for asundexian, an experimental drug designed to reduce the long-term risk of strokes in adults.It used AI to link the mid-stage trial results to real-world data from millions of patients in Finland and the United States to predict the long-term risks in a population similar to the trial.Armed with the data, Bayer started the late-stage trial with fewer participants. Without AI, Bayer said it would have spent millions more, and taken up to nine months longer to recruit volunteers.Now the company wants to take it a step further.For a study to test asundexian in children with the same condition, Bayer said it plans to use real-world patient data to generate a so-called external control arm, potentially eliminating the need for patients taking a placebo.That's because the condition is so rare in the age group it would be difficult to recruit patients, and could raise concerns about whether it was ethical to give trial participants a placebo when there are no proven treatments available.Instead, Bayer aims to mine anonymised real-world data of children with similar vulnerabilities.Bayer said it hoped that would be enough to help discern how effective the drug is. Finding real-world patients by mining electronic patient data can be done manually, but using AI speeds up the process dramatically.While unusual, external control arms have been used in the past instead of traditional randomised control arms where half the participants take a placebo - mainly for rare diseases where there are few patients or no existing treatments.Amgen's drug Blincyto, designed to treat a rare form of leukaemia, received U.S. approval after adopting this approach, although the company had to conduct a follow-up study to confirm the drug's benefit once it was on sale.Blythe Adamson, senior principal scientist at Roche subsidiary Flatiron Health, said the advantage of AI was that it let scientists examine real-world patient data quickly, and at scale.She said it could take months to trawl through data from 5,000 patients using traditional methods: ""Now we can learn those same things for millions of patients in days.""OVERESTIMATION RISKDrugmakers typically seek prior approval from regulators to test a drug using an external control arm.Bayer said it was in discussions with regulators, such as the FDA, about now relying on AI to create an external arm for its paediatric trial.

That doesn't account for the unknown,"" said Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence.Patients in trials tend to feel better than people in the real world because they believe they are getting an effective treatment and also get more medical attention, which could in turn overestimate the success of a drug.This risk is one of the reasons regulators tend to insist on randomised trials as all patients believe they are getting the drug, even though half are on a placebo.Gen Li, founder of clinical data analytics firm Phesi, said many companies were exploring AI's potential to reduce the need for control groups.Regulators, however, say that although AI has the potential to augment the clinical trial process, evidentiary standards for a drug's safety and effectiveness will not change.""The main risks with AI are that we want to make sure we don't get the wrong answer to the question of whether a drug works,"" said John Concato, associate director for real-world evidence analytics in the Office of Medical Policy in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.(Reporting by Natalie Grover and Martin Coulter in London; Additional reporting by Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago; Editing by Josephine Mason and David Clarke)]"

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Macy's Q2 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Comps Sales DeclineMacy’s reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein both top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, both metrics declined from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figures. Comparable sales fell on an owned basis and an owned-plus-licensed basis.Sales &amp; Earnings PictureMacy’s reported adjusted earnings of 26 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share. However, the bottom line declined 74% from the adjusted earnings of $1.00 per share reported in the year-ago fiscal period.Net sales of $5,130 million came ahead of the consensus estimate of $5,057 million. The top line dipped 8.4% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Comparable sales fell 8.2% on an owned basis and 7.3% on an owned-plus-licensed basis from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s figure. We expected comparable sales to decline 9.9% on an owned basis and 9.8% on an owned-plus-licensed basis.Macy’s’ digital sales dropped 10% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level. Brick-and-mortar sales decreased by 8% versus the second quarter of 2022.Net credit card revenues were $120 million, down 41.2% from the year-ago fiscal period’s level. The metric represented 2.3% of sales, down 130 basis points from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s figure.Details by BrandComparable sales across Macy’s declined 9.2% on an owned basis and 8.2% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. On a trailing 12-month basis, 41.5 million active customers shopped the Macy’s brand, down 5.5% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level. Star Rewards program members accounted for roughly 72% of the overall Macy's brand-owned-plus-licensed sales, up about 3 percentage points year over year. Strength in beauty, mainly fragrances and prestige cosmetics, men’s tailored, women’s career sportswear and off-price with Backstage aided results.At the Bloomingdale brand, comparable sales dropped 2.7% on an owned basis and 2.6% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. Management informed that 4 million active customers shopped the Bloomingdale’s brand on a trailing 12-month basis. Under the Bloomingdale banner, strength in beauty, shoes, women’s contemporary and designer apparel and its outlet locations drove results.Comparable sales at the Bluemercury brand were up 5.8% on an owned basis. About 736,000 active customers shopped the Bluemercury brand on a trailing 12-month basis. Strength in the skincare and color categories drove results.Story continuesMarginsThe gross margin came in at 38.1%, faring better than our estimate of 38%. The metric declined from 38.9% reported in the prior-year fiscal quarter.Merchandise margins contracted 130 basis points due to increased levels of clearance markdowns and promotions along with unfavorable category mix shifts. Delivery expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 50 basis points lower than the year-ago fiscal period, owing to improved carrier rates from contract renegotiations, reduced fuel costs and lower vendor direct volume.As a percentage of net sales, selling, general &amp; administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses increased 300 basis points year over year to 37.5%. SG&amp;A expenses consisted of investments in colleagues like competitive pay, incentives and benefits. Our estimate for SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales was 39% for the quarter under review.Macy’s reported an adjusted EBITDA of $347 million, down from an adjusted EBITDA of $616 million in the year-ago fiscal quarter.Other Financial AspectsMacy’s ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $438 million, long-term debt of $2,997 million and shareholders' equity of $4,210 million. M’s inventories were 10% lower on a year-over-year basis.During the first six months of fiscal 2023, Macy’s provided cash from operating activities of $271 million.A Peek Into GuidanceManagement is taking a cautious approach for the rest of the fiscal year and is reaffirming its annual sales and earnings view to reflect the expected macroeconomic impacts.The earnings guidance consists of gains from an incremental $200 million cost savings, which is likely to impact the gross margin and SG&amp;A expenses. Net sales are projected to be $22.8-$23.2 billion, in line with its previous forecast. Comparable owned plus licensed sales on a 52-week basis are still expected to decline 6-7.5% year over year. Digital sales are expected to be about one-third of net sales.For fiscal 2023, it expects gross margin to be in the band of 38.3% to 38.6%, while net interest expense is projected to be $160 million. Adjusted earnings per share are continuing to be envisioned in the range of $2.70-$3.20 for the fiscal year, down from $4.48 earned in the last fiscal year. Capital expenditures are envisioned to be about $950 million for the fiscal year.For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, management anticipates net sales to be in the band of $4.75 billion to $4.85 billion. It expects gross margin to improve by at least 140 basis points year-over-year. For the quarter, the bottom line is envisioned in the range of a loss of 3 cents per share to earnings of 2 cents per share. Inventories are expected to decline in low to mid-single digits percentage on a year-over-year basis.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -92.75% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Macy's has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a D.

This development has already caused a decline in share prices for US airlines and prompted profit warnings, despite a robust summer season with record profits reported by many airlines.The rise in airfares is also linked to a high demand for travel amid limited aircraft availability, a result of retirements during the pandemic and supply chain shortages. Finnair's CEO, Topi Manner, foresees further fare increases as airlines grapple with unprecedented fuel costs. Andrew Lobbenberg, Barclays aviation analyst, concurs with this outlook, anticipating European airlines will adjust their flying schedules in response to escalating expenses.Further straining the industry, airlines are paying a significant premium for jet fuel, which now stands at $130 per barrel. Francesco Di Salvo from S&amp;P Global Platts attributes this surge to strong travel demand and a deficit of jet fuel in Europe due to OPEC cuts, sanctions on Russia, and high demand for other refined products like diesel.Despite these challenges, European airlines have an edge over global rivals as they buy protections against sharp fluctuations in fuel prices. Barclays estimates that European carriers have hedged between 60% and 80% of their anticipated fuel needs for the last quarter of this year and between 16% and 45% for 2024.In contrast, US airlines typically do not hedge against fuel price fluctuations. This strategy has resulted in a series of profit warnings from them due to increasing fuel costs. Last week, both Delta and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) had to revise their third-quarter guidance downwards because of the escalating fuel costs.However, Chris Tarry, an aviation industry consultant, warns that airlines can only pass on these costs to customers if the surge in travel demand continues, forecasting a challenging winter for carriers.Story continuesSigns of weakening demand, particularly on domestic routes, are already evident in the US. Data from ticketing company Hopper indicates that average airfares for US trips in September and October were down 29% from peak summer months, at $211 per ticket. This represents a 9% drop from last year and a 10% decrease compared to 2019.This mix of profit warnings and demand concerns has triggered a sell-off in airline shares. Over the past three months, the MSCI World Airlines Index has dipped 16%, while the index tracking US airlines has plunged over 20%, entering a bear market.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Offline refinery capacity was expected to reach 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) this week according to IIR Energy versus 800,000 bpd offline last week.Money managers raised their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to Sept. 19, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said.(Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar in Houston and Nicole Jao in New York; Robert Harvey, Yuka Obayashi in Tokyo and Emily Chow in Singapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy, David Gregorio and Josie Kao)]"

This moment is an opportune time to invest in these undervalued sleeper stocks for long-term returns.Sleeper Stocks: Synchrony Financial (SYF)Synchrony Financial logo displayed on a phoneSource: rafapress/Shutterstock.comSynchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) is a consumer financial services company that offers corporations and consumers credit products, loan services, and banking.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSYF stock is currently valued at $32.28, which is down -0.34% YTD. 18 analysts have a positive outlook for SYK stock, predicting a 12-month median to high forecast of $38.50 to $55.00 or a 19.3% to 70.4% upside.The financial services market is currently valued at $25.51 trillion in 2022 and is expected to reach $58.69 trillion by 2031 at a 9.7% CAGR during the period.

It has a 246.19% difference from its sector median of 9.03%, and its net income margin is 31.83%, which is higher than the sector median of 25.78% (as of writing).Story continuesPrimary growth drivers for Synchrony are its contracts with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL).

This is advantageous in light of the thriving e-commerce sector. Plus, it has also led to a significant rise in cashless transactions, bolstering the appeal of Synchrony’s products among both partners and consumers.Investors should purchase SYF stock due to its robust financials and strong position in the e-commerce sector. I believe SYF is one of the best sleeper stocks to buy.Alaska Air Group (ALK)Alaska Airlines (ALK) aircraft is airborne as it departs Los Angeles International AirportSource: Philip Pilosian / Shutterstock.comAlaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) is an American air service that connects American cities and other North American countries through reasonably priced airfare.Despite ALK stock being down 4.86% YTD, financials are steadily growing and will provide subsequent growth to ALK. Alaska Air posted significant figures for Q2 2023, with revenue of $2.84 billion growing 6.77% YoY and beating analyst expectations by 2.53%. Net income of 240 million grew 72.66% YoY, and a diluted EPS of $1.86 increased by 61.76% YoY. The latter beat analyst expectations by 10.95%.Recent staff shortages due to COVID-19 pandemic-related reasons have all led to the global airline industry delaying or canceling commercial flights. However, with domestic and international tourism to business transportation consistently growing, the industry is shaping out to recover nicely. Job leads are growing at a 25.5% CAGR from 2022-2027, and the U.S. domestic market is bringing in $279.6 billion in annual revenue.Alaskan Airlines has identified its future growth catalyst in its 2023 and 2024 initiatives, which focus on improving the customer experience. The airline has allocated $2.5 billion for enhancing the hub airport experience. It also has a promise of guaranteeing a 5-minute lobby time for customers. This customer-centric investment is expected to yield significant benefits for the company. By improving the hub airport experience, Alaskan Airlines aims to make travel more convenient for passengers. This results in reduced boarding and transit times and increased operational efficiency. This—in turn, will lead to cost savings and improved customer loyalty. The commitment to a 5-minute lobby time sets Alaskan Airlines apart and offers travelers a more convenient travel experience.Based on a report by Yahoo! Finance, 11 analysts have projected a median price target of $63.36 for ALK stock over the next 12 months. The range of estimates varies from $50.00 to $75.00. ALK stock is a recommended purchase for September 2023. The company’s investment in enhancing customer experience will strengthen its reputation. But most importantly, it will improve customer retention, and increase competitiveness in the airline industry. Ultimately, it results in higher profits for the company.With that in mind, I believe ALK is one of the best sleeper stocks.Citigroup Incorporated (C)The logo for Citigroup (C) can be seen on the side of an office building for the company.Source: Willy Barton / Shutterstock.comCitigroup Incorporated (NYSE:C) is an investment bank and financial services company.

161,af4f0b69-c924-374f-ae43-648cba950b4f,MA,2023-09-22,10 Worst Performing Currencies in Asia,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-worst-performing-currencies-asia-165538149.html,1695315338,STORY,"['PYPL', 'MA']","[In this article, we discuss the 10 worst performing currencies in Asia. If you want to read about some more worst performing currencies, go directly to 5 Worst Performing Currencies in Asia. Asian currencies have been some of the worst affected as economic uncertainty sweeps across the world because of persistent inflation, rising geopolitical tensions, and a rapidly changing power dynamic between the North and the South. The influence of China and Russia on economies in Asia is also one of the prime reasons behind the weak performance of Asian currencies. Although the West has tried to squeeze the Russian economy to extract military benefits, most of the problems associated with the Chinese economy come from domestic troubles. Even large corporations in the US like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) are cautious of investments overseas in the wake of these developments. For example, Western sanctions on Russia have increased energy prices around the world since Russia is one of the biggest energy exporters not only to Europe but to Asia as well. Alongside energy, Russia is also a top food supplier to the globe. Even though Russian authorities are offering energy and food at discounted prices to tackle Western sanctions, there have been few takers, mostly only for publicity. Russian setbacks in Ukraine and a mutiny in Moscow have also done little to allay the concerns of Russian allies in Asia who are looking towards Moscow to ease their currency troubles. These events, combined with a strong US dollar, have pushed Asian currencies down. The South Korean Won, the Chinese Yuan, the Syrian Pound, and the Thai Baht have been some of the worst affected. Asian economies are tied closely to China and a real estate slowdown in the country pressured Asian currencies this year. However, earlier this week, the central bank in China announced that it would keep benchmark lending rates unchanged. The decision was in line with expectations as the government seeks to further stabilize the economic reopening following stringent COVID-19 restrictions. A weakening yuan in the open market has reduced governmental urgency to lower interest rates for growth. Xing Zhaopeng, a senior China strategist at financial services firm ANZ, has said that the growth forecast for China for the next two years has been revised to above 5% from around 4% earlier. Story continuesAsian currencies have, however, been hit hard by news from the other side of the Pacific. In the United States, the Federal Reserve chose not to raise rates further but indicated a further hike may be on the way in the coming months, boosting investor confidence in Treasury yield figures and the strength of the US dollar. The dollar index jumped above 105.5 following the news, the highest it has been in more than six months. This resulted in a mass selloff in Asian markets. Benchmark indexes in Singapore and South Korea were down nearly 1% following the Fed announcement. The currencies in Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Pakistan, Thailand, and a host of other Asian economies were also down. A fall in exports for Asian nations, mostly due to countries around the world allocating higher amounts for essentials such as food and energy, has also hit the Asian currency market. For example, research by trading firm KCM indicates that oil prices are at a ten-month high and inflation remains rampant across Singapore. Per data, the non-oil exports of the country have been falling in this environment, dropping to an eleven-month low in the beginning of September. Other Asian economies are also showing signs of a slide, with stocks in Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand dropping amid hawkish US central bank commentary on the economy. Treasury yields in the United States are one of the reasons why there has been investor aversion towards Asian markets which are loaded with risk. Since the first interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve in March 2022, the Treasury Yield has almost doubled. Presently, it is around 4.36%, as measured by the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note. This is the highest it has been in sixteen years. Asian currencies are expected to continue to face pressures from higher yields in the US, a strong dollar, loose monetary policies, and strong inflation in the coming months. Our MethodologyIn this article, we will list the 10 worst performing currencies in Asia. The ranking is calculated by calculating the percentage decrease in value of the currencies in terms of the US dollar value. The currencies in which the percentage decrease in value in terms of the US dollar are the highest are considered the worst performing. Data for this purpose has been taken from foreign exchange company XE. An initial data set comprising the 30 worst currencies in Asia with the highest value against the US dollar on January 2, 2023 was used. The percentage decrease was calculated by comparing this value against the worth of the currency against the US dollar on September 20, 2023. Digital coins were excluded from the list. The complex exchange rate figures have been rounded up for further clarity. 10 Worst Performing Currencies in AsiaCopyright: kikujungboy / 123RF Stock PhotoWorst Performing Currencies in Asia10. South Korean WonPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 1272 Price Against 1 USD on September 20, 2023: 1326Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 4%South Korean Won is the official currency of South Korean, a tiny country between China and Japan that is a major electronics hub for the rest of the world. Even as famous brands like Samsung contribute nearly a fourth of the total GDP of the country, the currency of the Korean nation has been on a wild ride this year due to pressures from Chinese economic data as well as interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve in the United States. The Won is often used as a proxy for trades in the Chinese Yuan, since China has strict currency controls. The dramatic devaluation of the Yuan has thus pressured the Won this year. The Korean economy is dependent on China in trade as well, and a slowdown in the Chinese economy this year has resulted in a slowdown in Korea too, devaluing the Won. Top firms like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) are all cautious on Asian investments ahead of the fourth quarter as Asian currencies feel the heat of a worsening food and energy crisis globally. 9. Chinese YuanPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 6.9 Price Against 1 USD on September 20, 2023: 7.3Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 6%Chinese Yuan is the official currency of China, one of the largest economies in the world. The Yuan has come under a lot of pressure this year due to several reasons. Some of these include the selling of Chinese stocks by investors outside of China, economic data figures from Beijing that have disappointed investors, widening yield differentials with the United States, and corporate dividend payments. The Chinese currency is one of the worst performing in Asia this year when measured against the US Dollar. However, when measured against other powerful currencies, it holds surprisingly steady. Beijing has put in place strong currency controls to limit capital outflows and reduced the amount of foreign reserves needed for large corporations to continue to function in order to shore up some confidence in the market. 8. Malaysian RinggitPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 4.40 Price Against 1 USD on September 20, 2023: 4.70Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 7%Malaysian Ringgit is the legal tender in Malaysia, a country in East Asia that has historically performed strongly against the US dollar, especially in the past three decades. Per reports, the almost 5% decline in the Ringgit this year last happened during the Asian financial crisis twenty-five years ago. Some of the reasons that the Ringgit has performed so badly this year include rising political uncertainty in the country, the strong demand for the US dollar worldwide amid soaring energy prices, a fall in exports for Malaysia, and the reliance of the Malaysian economy on China. Inaction on part of the government to control currency trades has also devalued the currency. 7. Uzbekistani SomPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 11229 Price Against 1 USD on September 20, 2023: 12163Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 8.3%Uzbekistani Som is the official currency of Uzbekistan, a country in Central Asia. Ever since getting independence from the Soviet Union, the country has strongly relied on Russian trade for economic stability. This is perhaps one of the reasons why the Uzbek currency has devalued against the US dollar this year. The Russian economy has come under heavy pressure amid the war in Ukraine, an internal mutiny in Moscow, and a ban on Russian energy exports. This has pummeled currencies that take their cue from the Russian Ruble. Uzbek authorities are mulling measures to attract more foreign investment to shore up the currency freefall. 6. Japanese YenPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 130Price Against 1 USD on September 20, 2023: 147Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 13%Japanese Yen is the official currency of Japan. In recent months, despite foreign currency inflows from exports, the Yen has come under pressure due to rising food and energy prices globally. Rising oil and gas prices are one of the reasons why the import bill of the country has gone up, and the government has been borrowing money to meet expenses. High Treasury yields in the US and a strong dollar are also decreasing interest in Asian market assets.Top firms like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) are all cautious on Asian businesses ahead of the fourth quarter as Asian currencies feel the heat of a worsening food and energy crisis globally.  Click to continue reading and see 5 Worst Performing Currencies in Asia. Suggested Articles:11 Best Wine Stocks To Buy13 Best Materials Stocks To Buy12 Countries That Produce the Best CoffeeDisclosure.

The platform will be initially unveiled across the country’s three states, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, and its reach will be gradually expanded to other India markets.Mastercard Community Pass is a digital platform, which offers tools and technologies to counter infrastructure headwinds that often crop up with the digitization of rural communities. The challenges often relate to unsecured connectivity, low smartphone usage and the lack of persistent recogntion or credentials. It also equips farmers to create transaction history and credit-building opportunities, thereby paving the way for more farmers to join the formal financial system.Backed by the strength of this MA platform, Bharat Kisan Manch targets to assist millions of farmers and agricultural entrepreneurs in India within the span of next three years. The recent partnership will witness the integration of technology and the digital payments prowess of Mastercard with AEGF’s 15,000 plus agricultural entrepreneur network and training.This, in turn, is expected to expand the access to formal financial services, which may boost efficiency, fetch improved crop yields and increased profits for farmers. Bharat Kisan Manch will provide farmers with exposure to new agricultural marketplaces and an increased number of potential buyers, thus offering them opportunities for better livelihoods. In addition to this, farmers using online means can enhance their credit profiles and, enjoy access to institutional credit and crop advisory services through the newly unveiled platform.The recent tie-up reinforces Mastercard’s sincere efforts to integrate digital solutions within the underserved agricultural markets of India. And the expansive footprint of AEGF across the agricultural sector of the country makes it an apt partner to complement MA’s endeavor. The move seems to be a time opportune one as well, considering an expanding agricultural market and widespread digital transformation measures which are being adopted nationwide.Story continuesThe recent partnership marks an effort on the part of Mastercard to grow the customer base of its Community Pass platform, which has played a crucial role in digitizing agricultural value chains of several countries. Notably, 1.5 million farmers in India leverage Community Pass to access agricultural markets, financial services and agricultural input providers.

163,deead574-aa2b-3cf4-8cc5-5c165714fb8f,MA,2023-09-22,IDAI: Trust Stamp’s Tokenized Biometric System Decreases Fraud While Protecting Privacy and Preventing Data Breaches,Zacks Small Cap Research,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/idai-trust-stamp-tokenized-biometric-091500445.html,1695287700,STORY,"['IDAI', 'MA']","[By Lisa ThompsonNASDAQ:IDAITrust Stamp (NASDAQ:IDAI) is in the business of using biometrics to prevent fraud and confirm identities. It applies its AI-enabled technology to a variety of uses targeting various corporate verticals and government entities. Its technology is unique and a vast improvement over legacy methods for one major reason—it takes a person’s biometric data and irreversibly tokenizes it to be unidentifiable if hacked, but the token can be stored for later use. Currently, many companies that use biometric data are afraid to save it due to the risk of a data breach, so they delete it after its one-time use. Trust Stamp is the only company with the technology (protected by patents) to tokenize the data.An example of its technology can be shown in an online store purchase where the buyer wants to set up a payment plan. The store may ask you to upload the front and back of a driver’s license, then snap a selfie of your face so they can match the two. Trust Stamp can also check that the license is not counterfeit. If the license and the face match and everything else meets the criteria, the account can be opened. With most biometric vendors, this is the end of the process: once the account is opened, the biometric data is destroyed because of the potential liability involved in keeping even encrypted biometric templates.Alternatively, using Trust Stamp technology, the retailer can retain a token based on the selfie that was taken with sufficient information to match against another Trust Stamp token, but containing no information that could lead to the outright identification of the person. Tokens have only one use: to match against other tokens. This proprietary technology allows for secure biometric re-authentication at a later point. And if, for example, someone does not have a picture match or the license is counterfeit, the token generated for that person can be put on a watchlist so that person can never open an account in the future without heightened authentication processes. This alleviates considerable fraud loss as most fraudsters are repeat offenders. It also improves a customer’s experience as additional changes to their profile do not require them to input all the deleted biometric data. If your address changes, you don’t have to reinput anything else except the new address.Story continuesTrust Stamp trades at a market cap of $16 million (enterprise value of $13 million) and in the past twelve months generated $2.8 million in sales. It is not profitable and is burning about $2 million a quarter in cash but hopes to be cash flow breakeven by the end of 2024 due to a combination of extreme cost-cutting and revenue growth. The company raised a total of $8.13 million in gross proceeds in two registered direct offerings during Q2 2023 on April 14 and June 1 for $5.19 and $2.94 million, respectively. The company is pursuing several large opportunities, particularly with the government that could dramatically change its fate.93% of Revenues Come From Four Major CustomersThe majority of Trust Stamp’s revenues are generated by four major customers, but it is expected to add many smaller businesses as it now sells its products packaged as a low-code SaaS solution implemented using APIs. Its four major customers which totaled 93% of the revenues of the first six months of 2023, were: a Fortune 500 bank (45%), Mastercard (28%), FIS (10%), and Triton, the Canadian background check company, (10%).Fortune 500 BankThis customer was one of Trust Stamp’s first and initially deployed a custom solution that is used for its eCommerce customers. It has since transitioned to the company’s standardized Orchestration Layer. The bank offers a B2B solution to retailers offering BNPL (buy now pay later) plans or opening new store-brand credit cards or offering loans. It helps its customers reduce fraud with face-matching biometrics.MastercardMastercard (NYSE:MA) uses Trust Stamp to facilitate its plans in Africa to provide digital identities to hundreds of millions of residents without traditional access to identification services. Presently Mastercard is working on projects to use biometrics to aid healthcare and vaccine distribution as well as general aid distribution and digital empowerment for farmers.One such pilot is in Ethiopia where the Ministry of Health, Mastercard, Gavi, and JSI (John Snow, Inc) have partnered on a digital, portable health pass. They are using Mastercard’s Wellness Pass within Ethiopia’s health information system to promote efficiency in healthcare tracking and offline portability of health records in the most marginalized communities. Mauritania is also using the Mastercard Wellness Pass for vaccination records.FISFIS (NYSE:FIS), the $32 billion financial technology company is a channel partner for Trust Stamp, and it sells Trust Stamp’s SaaS solution to the banks and financial institutions with which it works. FIS’s large footprint has it interact with 95% of the global financial institutions making it an excellent source of customer acquisition. So far it has 30 banks testing the Trust Stamp solution which should start generating revenues in 2024. It expects to have 45-50 banks by year-end. Trust Stamp gets paid on transaction volume as banks use their various solutions for various applications including opening credit card or bank accounts and fraud identification.TritonTriton is the industry leader for background checks in Canada and was Trust Stamp’s first SaaS customer. Triton also pays by usage and requires little to no support. As Triton uses the Trust Stamp system, the system becomes even more accurate through machine learning from the metadata. Trust Stamp is pursuing more customers in this high-margin vertical.Opportunities for Trust Stamp Are All Around in Public and Private ApplicationsPart of the problem for Trust Stamp is seeking the best opportunities to pursue where the customer will get the biggest return and the sale is easiest. They can pursue whales or guppies. The company is focusing on the guppies but continues to bid on the whales which can quickly change its fate.Huge Upside If the Company Can Win a Government ContractIn the past ICE was a large pilot customer for Trust Stamp in the Alternative to Detention program. It used its technology to identify and track illegal aliens that entered the US. ICE took biometrics and gave entrants a phone with which they were to check in with facial recognition each day. Using geolocation, this technology allowed ICE to confirm that a person was where they said they were. However, ICE ran out of money for the project in 2022, and the $7.2 million contract was canceled for convenience with compensation paid to Trust Stamp. The specific function that Trust Stamp worked on is now part of a much larger RFI issued by ICE and it is anticipated that an RFP will result in 2024.Many Alternative to Detention programs exist at the federal, state and even municipal levels, and last week the company announced the launch of its new “Tap-In Band”, a wrist-worn, tamper-resistant NFC band that can be used for discrete check-in by, and communication with, participants in the ICE (or any other) program. Combined with the user’s smartphone, this band uses GPS and NFC technologies to verify its location by tapping the band to the phone. Then the system uses facial biometric authentication to confirm that the right person is in the right place. Trust Stamp’s identity tokenization assures privacy and security.Alternative to Detention programs cost taxpayers a fraction of the cost of detention and have been proven to have a high success rate. Compared to competitors' solutions, Trust Stamp believes that its technology and devices will cost up to 100 times less in capital and operational costs and can be quickly implemented. As the border is increasingly overwhelmed and states and cities begin to push back, we think this issue will need to be addressed sooner rather than later. Trust Stamp’s solution has already been proven and that combined with its new hardware may give it an even better chance of winning the rebid.Other OpportunitiesAnother opportunity is with the IRS whose login system was deemed the worst ever. The agency is looking to replace it due primarily to privacy issues, and a similar but larger opportunity also exists with the Government Service Agency for which Trust Stamp has already completed a number of RFI responses. Trust Stamp plans to bid on both of those opportunities where it believes its tokenized solution would be far superior to the competition because of the privacy protection that is afforded.The company also believes there are massive opportunities in the private sector. One industry that could use help is ride-sharing. Trust Stamp could make sure that the person driving the car is the one registered on the app and is the same person showing up which is often not the case.At the end of August, the company added six veteran sales team members and has already seen a meaningful increase in its sales pipeline. The company continues to primarily pursue financial institutions where it can sell its SaaS solution and any other applications that can use its off-the-shelf offering. This should raise margins and propel the company faster toward profitability. The company has stated that it believes due to these already-signed customers and a large sales pipeline it expects 2024 revenues to be a significant improvement over 2023. Any wins of large government contracts would just be icing on the cake. While still a risky startup, investors should keep an eye on Trust Stamp due to its patented and unique technology, recent sales success, and potential for large government wins in the coming year.SUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH to receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

The U.S-based chip giant confirmed on Friday that the restructuring plan, which includes significant workforce reductions, is expected to be completed by March 2024.The company stated that the restructuring is necessary to enable continued investments in key growth and diversification opportunities amid the ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and demand environment. While Qualcomm did not provide specific details regarding the number of employees affected by the layoffs, it did mention that a substantial portion of the restructuring charges could be reflected in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.Qualcomm dismissed rumors of a large-scale office closure or full exit from Shanghai, according to a report by China Business News. Despite facing challenges due to economic uncertainties and weakened demand in consumer electronics, which led to a 23% year-over-year revenue slump to $8.45 billion for the quarter ending June 25, Qualcomm maintains substantial operations in China across 12 cities.The company's decision to trim its workforce comes as it aims to focus on key growth and diversification.

The companies' previous agreement was set to expire this year, and the upcoming iPhone was expected to be one of the last relying on Qualcomm modems.A Wall Street Journal report revealed that Apple's in-house 5G modems are estimated to be three years behind Qualcomm. The report also highlighted issues such as poor communication between managers and lofty ambitions as factors contributing to the project's delay.The development of the in-house modem began in 2018 under the leadership of former wireless director Jaydeep Ranade. Despite Apple's unmatched prowess in the custom silicon segment, it faced difficulties in developing a modem that complied with strict connectivity regulations worldwide and was compatible with different wireless carriers.Apple had initially planned to debut its custom-built 5G modem in iPhones starting in 2025. However, given the performance and efficiency challenges faced by the prototypes, there is a chance that the company might postpone the official launch again.Previous reports had suggested Apple would debut its custom-built 5G modem as early as 2023. However, these expectations seem to have been dashed as unnamed Apple executives acknowledged that their first custom 5G chips were far behind Qualcomm's leading Snapdragon X75 modem.It is now uncertain whether Apple will unveil its first in-house 5G modem during the iPhone 16 announcement next year.

Burry’s insight and strategic thinking led him to invest in three seemingly disparate industries: healthcare, travel, and entertainment. Burry’s selection appears to have in common a tapestry of strategic considerations, financial insights, and growth potential. The article analyzes Burry’s rationale for betting on these three diverse stocks. It delves into the intricacies of the first’s integration strategy, the second’s technological leaps, and the third’s ambitious plans for expansion. Here are the three Michael Burry stocks:Michael Burry Stocks: CVS Health (CVS)the exterior of a CVS pharmacy storeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comThe health conglomerate CVS Health’s (NYSE:CVS) strategic initiatives and financial performance indicate a strong foundation for growth and value creation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOne of the most significant contributors to CVS Health’s long-term growth is the integration of Signify Health and Oak Street Health. These two are value-based care assets. They drive patient engagement and growth by connecting these acquisitions with existing CVS Health assets such as Aetna, MinuteClinic, and CVS Pharmacy. This integration will lead to synergistic opportunities and an accelerated growth trajectory.Further, another notable achievement is the expansion of CVS Health’s exchange offering to 12 states, with over one million new members onboarded. This establishes a connection for these members across its integrated assets. As a result, it is laying the groundwork for future earnings growth and increased engagement across its diversified businesses.CVS Health’s strong cash flow generation financially enables them to invest in their long-term strategy and return value to shareholders. Over $13 billion of operating cash flow was generated for the current fiscal year. It has also returned $3.5 billion to shareholders through June 30, enhancing shareholder value.Story continuesNotably, it has a diversified business model. The model comprises healthcare benefits, health services, pharmacy, and consumer wellness segments. Despite emerging headwinds, it has delivered strong revenue growth, adjusted EPS, and cash flow from operations in the recent quarter.Strategically, the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health have strengthened the company’s healthcare delivery assets. Specifically, Signify Health’s in-home evaluations drive engagement and improved care outcomes. Similarly, Oak Street Health’s community presence accelerates patient growth and clinic profitability.Finally, CVS Health can navigate challenges while maintaining growth and executing its long-term strategy. It is demonstrated by its ability to manage cost structures, optimize operations, and invest in critical growth areas such as health services and technology. I believe it is one of the best Michael Burry stocks to buy right now.Expedia (EXPE)building facade with expedia (EXPE) group logoSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.comExpedia’s (NASDAQ:EXPE) platform transformation is ongoing, with the recent launch of the “One Key” travel rewards program in the U.S. The program unifies the loyalty offerings across Expedia’s core brands, providing customers with a common currency (One Key Cash) for booking flights, hotels, vacation rentals, car rentals, cruises, and activities. This unique offering may continue to drive customer engagement and loyalty, ultimately increasing lifetime value.Notably, Expedia operates in both B2C and B2B segments. Its B2C strategy focuses on building customer loyalty through app usage and loyalty membership, which results in higher repeat rates and increased profitability per transaction.Strategically, Expedia invests in cutting-edge technology, including AI and machine learning. For instance, the launch of conversational trip planning powered by ChatGPT represents its focus on enhancing and personalizing the customer experience. The integration of AI technologies allows for improved recommendations and streamlined trip planning.Also, Expedia’s single-tech strategy (AI and machine learning) allows all its brands to benefit from its product features. That may be driving further differentiation.Regarding market expansion, Expedia’s growth isn’t limited to North America and Europe. It has witnessed stronger growth in APAC and Latin America. It signals diversification of its revenue sources and leads in emerging markets with increasing travel demands.Expedia’s partnerships with major players like MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) underscore its ability to leverage technology and travel expertise for mutually beneficial collaborations. As a result, it is expanding its market reach and driving growth. Finally, Expedia’s focus on acquiring and retaining loyalty members and app users has shown success, as active loyalty members reached new highs and app usage increased. The strategy translates to higher profitability per transaction and greater customer lifetime value. That said, it is one of the best Michael Burry stocks, in my book.MGM Resorts (MGM)A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building.Source: Michael Neil Thomas / Shutterstock.comMGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) has significant consolidated net revenues based on solid domestic portfolio earnings and remarkable results at MGM China and BetMGM.In Las Vegas, there’s an upsurge in demand, exemplified by increased casino drop, hotel revenues, and occupancy. The agreement with Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) was a watershed moment, giving rise to the MGM collection with Marriott Bonvoy. This alliance will enable over 180 million members to reserve rooms and accrue or redeem Marriott Bonvoy points across 17 MGM Resorts properties. That, in turn, is leading to enhanced profitability through lowered customer acquisition costs, higher ADRs, and elevated on-property spending. Forecasts predict that by 2025, Marriott’s customer base will constitute a significant portion of MGM’s hotel mix, bolstering premium rates.Regional operations witnessed year-over-year top-line growth, factoring in the sale of Gold Strike Tunica. A consistent focus on optimizing profitability and sustained great customer service has led to this success. Also, Macau has seen outstanding quarterly performance and remarkable EBITDAR, positioning the company well for sustained growth.Notably, BetMGM is on track to attain profitability in H2 2023. Also, MGM Resorts’ 37,000 rooms in Las Vegas facilitate BetMGM’s exposure to new customers daily. These synergies create a seamless experience through the BetMGM app across state borders.The company’s future looks bright with developments such as potential licensing in New York by H1 2024 and advancements in Japan. This is bolstered by the thriving sports and entertainment scene in Las Vegas, which aligns with MGM Resorts’ plans for operating leverage growth. The balance sheet also has considerable strength, with more cash than debt and a significantly reduced share count, highlighting the company’s strong financial position. This is why I believe it is one of the best Michael Burry stocks.On the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure radomes used on the F/A-18 E/F aircraft.This deal will serve the U.S. Navy and the government of Kuwait. Work related to this deal will be executed in St. Louis, MO.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has several combat proven aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of jet delivery and support orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such strong order flows are expected to boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the world’s largest weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products.

North America constitutes the largest share of the market.Such developments can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities as well as increased defense spending.

184,9049033e-07a5-3512-b493-d5db33406489,CCI,2023-09-22,How to Preserve Your Wealth According to Bill Gates’ Portfolio,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/preserve-wealth-according-bill-gates-190830870.html,1695323310,STORY,"['MSFT', 'CCI']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at how to preserve your wealth by observing Bill Gates' Portfolio. To delve deeper into these insights, you can directly review the 5 Sectors to Invest In to Preserve Your Wealth According to Bill Gates' Portfolio.Focusing on simple business models that generate dependable cash flows is a strategy that has allowed Bill Gates to amass and preserve wealth over the years. The Harvard University dropout has become a force to reckon with in the investment world despite being known for his escapades with Microsoft.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), the company Gates helped found, sits at the heart of the computing revolution and is a vital source of the billionaire investor and philanthropist's wealth. Founded in 1976, Microsoft would find itself in stiff competition against Apple in the initial years in the race to take the personal computing crown.Facing stiff competition from Steve Jobs, who sought to control the entire user experience through the Macintosh operating system, Gates focused on developing an operating system that would be used on any computer.His efforts and focus would pay years later as Microsoft ended up becoming the world’s largest computer operating system in the world.Microsoft's control of the computer operating system has made it a trillion-dollar company. Likewise, the company accounts for the biggest share of Mr. Gates' wealth as he still holds about 1.3% of stakes in the software giant. Microsoft's growth is a dream come true for Bill Gates, who has always insisted on focusing on what you are obsessed with the most.In a 2016 television interview with Charlie Rose, Gates remarked, “The thing you do obsessively between age 13 and 18, that's the thing you have the most chance of being world-class at.”Gates has always been obsessed with coding, forcing him to drop out of Harvard and form what will become a force to reckon with in the computing world.Story continuesAfter nearly four decades, Gates would leave the company he helped found and charter another path as an investor and philanthropist. With a net worth of more than $110 billion, Gates is nowadays more interested in giving his money away rather than acquiring more. Along with his now ex-wife, Melinda Gates, he has donated more than $30 billion in stock from Microsoft through the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.Despite his philanthropy work, Gates is also a big investor in betting on various stocks, a drive influenced by his solid relationship with billionaire investor Warren Buffett. When asked what he was obsessed with as a teenager by CNBC, Gates is quoted as saying, “Well, I was pretty interested in investments,” This might explain how he turned out to be one of the biggest and most successful investors despite being a tech guru.His foundation holds vast portfolio investments in various stocks and startups. Buffett is believed to have a strong influence on Gates' investment philosophy. A majority of Mr. Gates' financial assets are held by Cascade Investments L.L.C., an institute he founded that accounts for the biggest share of his holdings. The investment portfolio is well diversified, with holdings in various industries ranging from tech to industrial, real estate, and consumer discretionary.How to Preserve Your Wealth According to Bill Gates' PortfolioThe diversified nature of Mr. Gates' holdings is depicted by billions worth of holdings in Microsoft, giving him tremendous exposure in the tech industry. He also owns holdings in Four Seasons hotels in Mexico and stakes in branded Entertainment Network for exposure in the advertising sector.The billionaire investor has also sought to preserve his real estate wealth, having invested a significant amount of money into buying real estate assets. The investor is also big in transportation with Canadian National Railway Corporation investments. He is also the chair of Nuclear Reactor Designs Company, affirming his interest in the energy sector. Gates also funds initiatives in clean energy education and healthcare.Gates' wealth is spread out over several sectors as part of his diversification strategy. The diversification strategy focuses on capital preservation rather than rapid appreciation. The investment strategy has seen him invest nearly 60% of his wealth in stocks in various industries, the highest of any family office portfolio in North America.Our MethodologyBill Gates made much of his wealth through his close ties with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). However, after leaving the company, he has ventured into the investment world in the race to preserve and grow his wealth. Diversification has turned out to be the billionaire investor's important strategy in the race to preserve wealth. We have compiled some of the biggest segments the billionaire investors has turned to safeguard his wealth. The sectors are arranged according to their weighting in the billionaire and philanthropic investor's portfolio during the second quarter of 2023.How to Preserve Your Wealth According to Bill Gates' Portfolio9. Communication ServicesSector Weighting in Q2 2023: 0.26%Communication Service is a market segment made up of companies that provide communication services using fiber line networks or those that leverage wireless networks. The segment also includes companies that provide internet services such as access navigational and internet-related software and services.Some of the best communication services companies include those that have been around for years and pay attractive dividends. It also includes early-stage startups that are years away from showing profits. Nevertheless, companies are often susceptible to deteriorating economic conditions.During economic contractions, spending on communications or advertising often takes a hit, affecting the company’s performance.Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. (NYSE:MSGS) is a diversified sports company that owns and operates several professional sports franchises, such as the New York Knicks (N.B.A.), the New York Rangers (N.H.L.), and the New York Liberty (WNBA). It also owns and operates sports venues, such as Madison Square Garden and the Hulu Theater, as well as media networks, such as M.S.G. Network and M.S.G. Plus.Gates has a stake in Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. (NYSE:MSGS) through his Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. As of June 30, 2023, the trust held 592,410 shares of MSGS, valued at $111.40 million. This represents 0.3% of the trust's portfolio. Gates has been investing in MSGS since 2021 when he bought 278,147 shares.He apparently sees MSGS as a long-term investment that can benefit from the popularity and growth of sports entertainment and media. MSGS does not pay a dividend to its shareholders, as it reinvests its earnings into its business operations and growth initiatives. The company's stock price has increased by 19% over the past 12 months, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 index by 5.11%.8. Real estateSector Weighting in Q2 2023: 0.28%The real estate sector comprises companies that own and operate commercial and residential properties. It also includes real estate investment trusts that operate properties and collect rent. Investors highly seek the segment as it provides stable income and tax advantages depending on the investment type. REIT stocks are some of the best owing to their generous yields as they distribute up to 90% of their net income to shareholders.Real Estate has always been one of the best options for Bill Gates in preserving wealth. The billionaire invests in sprawling estates, including his Seattle home, an ocean lodge boasting over 66,000 square feet. He also owns properties in Wellington, Florida, snapping a four-bedroom mansion and horse ranch for $8.7 million. He also bought adjacent parcels for a total of $35.87 million.Bill Gates owns a significant stake in Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI), a real estate investment trust that owns and operates communication infrastructure in the U.S. Crown Castle is one of the largest providers of cell towers, fiber networks, and small cell nodes that are essential for the deployment of 5G technology.As of the second quarter of 2023, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust held over 1.42 million shares in Crown Castle, valued at $161.80 million. This represents 0.38% of the trust's portfolio.Gates has been investing in Crown Castle since 2014 when he bought 5.3 million shares for about $375 million. He has maintained his position since then despite the fluctuations in the stock price and the dividend yield. One of the companies that Bill Gates invests in to protect and grow his wealth is Crown Castle, a leader in communication infrastructure in the U.S. Crown Castle owns and rents out over 40,000 cell towers and 85,000 miles of fiber optic cables that support small cells and fiber solutions. The company boasts a juicy 5.5% forward yield, which affirms why it is in the portfolio.7. Consumer CyclicalSector Weighting in Q2 2023: 0.46%Consumer Cyclical is a market segment dominated by companies that produce non-essential commodities. Also known as the consumer discretionary segment, it encompasses businesses and companies that sell dispensable goods and services like designer clothing, automobiles, eateries, and entertainment. Such companies are billed as cyclical as their performance highly depends on the economy's health or prevailing economic situation.Consumer discretionary plays tend to outperform whenever the economy is booming with increased consumer spending. They also underperform during depressed economic situations. The segment has performed well over the past three years owing to increased consumer spending on solid economic conditions.Gates has a small exposure in the consumer cyclical segment with investments in Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG), an online shopping platform in South Korea. He has also invested in Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA), a company that operates an e-commerce platform for buying and selling used cars. Vroom, an end-to-end e-commerce platform for buying and selling cars, is also part of the portfolio. He has also invested in On Holding AG (NYSE:ONON).6. HealthcareSector Weighting in Q2 2023: 1.04%The healthcare segment consists of businesses that offer medical care, produce medical devices or drugs, and provide medical insurance. It is one of the largest and most complex in the U.S. economy, accounting for 18% of the total gross domestic product. Spending in the segment is expected to hit record highs of $12 trillion by 2040.Bill Gates has always been a big investor in the healthcare sector. He is on record insisting that initiatives to fight malaria, AIDS, and other diseases in poor countries will always be America’s best investment for saving lives.In 2019, Gates reiterated that his best investment was the $10 billion invested through the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation into organizations to increase access to vaccines and medicines for people worldwide. He invested the amounts into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the Global Fund to Fight Tuberculosis and Malaria, AIDS, and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.Currently, he is invested in Schrödinger, Inc. (NASDAQ:SDGR), a company that develops a physics-based computational platform to discover novel molecules for drug development. The company leverages artificial intelligence technology to discover novel molecules with optimal drug development profiles. Schrödinger, Inc. stock was added to the hedge fund's portfolio during the first quarter of 2020 when Gates bought 6.98 million shares.Another healthcare stock in Gates’ portfolio includes Danaher Corporation (NYSE: D.H.R.). His hedge fund first invested in the company in the fourth quarter of 2022. The hedge fund still holds 373,000 shares of the company, worth more than $89.52 million.Click to continue reading and see 5 Sectors to Invest In to Preserve Your Wealth According to Bill Gates' Portfolio.Suggested articles:17 Best Low Risk Investments in 202310 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside15 Penny Stocks with Biggest UpsideDisclosure: None. How to Preserve Your Wealth According to Bill Gates' Portfolio is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The trial enrolled patients who may or may not be eligible for treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, regardless of PD-L1 status.In the trial, KEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin met its dual primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement versus chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated la/mUC. The combination also showed a statistically significant improvement in overall response rate (ORR), a key secondary endpoint, versus chemotherapy. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA and enfortumab vedotin in this study was consistent with previously reported studies of this combination.""The results of this pivotal Phase 3 study are highly encouraging and showed a statistically significant survival benefit for the combination of KEYTRUDA with the antibody-drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin in cisplatin-eligible or cisplatin-ineligible patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma,"" said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. ""This is an important milestone, as many patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma still experience disease progression following chemotherapy. We look forward to sharing these data with the medical community and regulatory authorities.""Story continuesThe Phase 3 KEYNOTE-A39 trial is intended to serve as the confirmatory trial for the current U.S. accelerated approval of KEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin as first-line treatment for patients with la/mUC who are not eligible to receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy based on data from the KEYNOTE-869 trial (also known as EV-103) dose escalation cohort, Cohort A and Cohort K.Merck, in collaboration with Seagen and Astellas, are evaluating this combination as part of an extensive clinical development program in multiple stages of urothelial cancer, including two Phase 3 clinical trials in muscle-invasive bladder cancer in KEYNOTE-B15 (NCT04700124, also known as EV-304) and KEYNOTE-905 (NCT03924895, also known as EV-303).About the KEYNOTE-A39 (EV-302) trialThe KEYNOTE-A39 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04223856) is an open-label, randomized, controlled Phase 3 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin compared with chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus cisplatin or carboplatin) for the treatment of patients with previously untreated la/mUC who may or may not be able to receive treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The dual primary endpoints are PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and OS. Key secondary endpoints include ORR per RECIST v1.1 by BICR, time to pain progression and duration of response per RECIST v1.1 by BICR. The study enrolled 886 patients who were randomized to receive either:KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously [IV] on Day 1 of each three-week cycle for a maximum of 35 cycles or a protocol-defined reason for study discontinuation occurs, whichever is first) plus enfortumab vedotin (125 mg/m2 by IV on Days 1 and 8 of each three-week cycle for an unlimited number of cycles until a protocol defined reason for study discontinuation occurs); orGemcitabine (administered as IV infusion on Days 1 and 8 of each three-week cycle) plus platinum-containing chemotherapy (either carboplatin [administered by IV on Day 1 of each three-week cycle] or cisplatin [administered by IV on Day 1 of each three-week cycle]) for a maximum of six cycles or a protocol-defined reason for study discontinuation occurs, whichever is first.About bladder and urothelial cancerUrothelial cancer, or bladder cancer, begins in the urothelial cells, which line the urethra, bladder, ureters, renal pelvis and some other organs. In the U.S., it is estimated that approximately 82,290 people will be diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2023. Globally, it is estimated that approximately 573,000 new cases of bladder cancer are reported annually. Urothelial cancer accounts for about 90% of all bladder cancers. Approximately 12% of cases are la/mUC at diagnosis. Many patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma face a poor prognosis and experience disease progression following initial treatment with chemotherapy.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Urothelial CarcinomaKEYTRUDA, in combination with enfortumab vedotin, is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC):who are not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy, orwho have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin-unresponsive, high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy.See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety InformationSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 41 (7%) patients, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. In adult patients who received adjuvant therapy for NSCLC, patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Thyroid DisordersKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity.

Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA.

For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

With the FDA granting priority review to the sBLA, a final decision is expected on Jan 20, 2024.The sBLA is seeking approval for Keytruda (pembrolizumab) plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer. The sBLA is based on data from the phase III KEYNOTE-A18 study. Data from this study showed that treatment with Keytruda plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival in the abovementioned patient group compared to concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone.Keytruda is presently approved for two indications of cervical cancer. The first one is in combination with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, for the treatment of persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer. The second indication is a monotherapy for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy. If the latest sBLA is approved, it would be Merck’s third approved indication in cervical cancer and the first for an earlier stage.Merck’s stock has declined 3.3% so far this year against an increase of 7.7% for the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Keytruda is presently approved to treat seven indications in earlier-stage cancers in the United States. Sales of Keytruda rose 23%, excluding Fx impact, in the first half of 2023 to $12.06 billion. Numerous recent approvals and the expected launch of many additional indications, including in earlier lines of therapy, can further boost sales. In the United States, Merck expects over half of Keytruda’s growth to come from indications in early-stage treatment settings through 2025 and to represent roughly 25% of total global Keytruda sales by that time.Story continuesKeytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer, including both monotherapy and combination studies. Merck is also working on different strategies to drive Keytruda’s long-term growth. These include innovative immuno-oncology combinations, including Keytruda with TIGIT, LAG3 and CTLA-4 inhibitors. Merck is also leveraging Keytruda benefits across several cancer types to identify and develop promising new oncology candidates.Along with Moderna (MRNA), Merck is developing a personalized mRNA therapeutic cancer vaccine (V940/mRNA-4157) in combination with Keytruda for the treatment of adjuvant melanoma. Merck/Moderna initiated a pivotal phase III study in adjuvant melanoma in July 2023.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderMerck has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(NYSE:BA) is soaring through turbulence, oscillating between the gravity of its disappointments and the lift of its potential.Its ambitious financial targets are under threat, with 737 deliveries stalling and defense projects in jeopardy. Yet, against this cloudy backdrop, sunbeams of hope emerge through booming aviation markets in China and Vietnam.The aerospace titan finds itself in a complex balancing actgrappling with geopolitical intricacies, an impressive yet languishing MAX series and Wall Street's cautiously optimistic stance.The disappointing realityWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with BA. Click here to check it out. BA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of BAIn November 2022, Boeing set ambitious goals, aiming for a free cash flow (FCF) of $3-5 billion in 2023 and $10 billion between 2025 and 2026. The main drivers were supposed to be increased production of the 737 and overcoming supply chain difficulties in its Defense, Space &amp; Security (BDS) division.However, the company has underperformed on both fronts. The latest update revealed 737 deliveries are likely to be at the lower end of the estimated range of 400-450 for 2023, due partly to manufacturing issues from fuselages supplied by Spirit AeroSystems. This is the second setback this year, making the full-year guidance increasingly unlikely.On the defense side, BDS struggles with supply chain and labor issues. The segment also faces hurdles in de-risking fixed-price programs and improving profitability, with 25% of its legacy programs still underperforming.August scorecard: Challenges in 737 MAX offset by robust wide-body deliveriesIn August, Boeing's performance presented a mixed bag with some bright spots amidst challenges. On the one hand, the company faced production issues from its supplier Spirit AeroSystems, affecting the delivery of its 737 MAX airplanes, which is soft.However, this was partially offset by a robust flow of wide-body deliveries, including five Boeing 767stwo of which were base aircraft for the KC-46A tankerand three Boeing 767-300Fs for FedEx Express (FDX), as well as three Boeing 777Fs and four Boeing 787s.Story continuesDespite these issues, the overall August delivery numbers remained stable year-over-year at 35 airplanes. Interestingly, the value of these deliveries increased from $2.5 billion last year to $2.9 billion this year, suggesting a favorable delivery mix and higher volume.Year-to-date, Boeing has shown signs of recovery, delivering 344 airplanes valued at $24.7 billion, a 24% increase in deliveries and a 36% increase in delivery value compared to the same period last year.Silver linings: China and Vietnam dealsPresident Biden recently welcomed a ""landmark"" $8 billion deal between Boeing and Vietnam Air for 50 MAX jets. This signals international faith in Boeing's technology and provides a much-needed shot in the arm for the beleaguered company.Undoubtedly, China plays a vital role in Boeing's medium and long-term growth strategies. With rising air travel in China, the country will need more airplanes. Boeings Commercial Market Outlook (CMO) predicts that China will need 8,560 new commercial airplanes through 2042.Approving deliveries of the stored 737 MAXs earmarked for Chinese airlines could be the fastest way for Beijing to meet its growing travel demands. Recent reports suggest that some Chinese airlines have already started using 737 MAXs stored on Chinese soil for commercial flights, pointing towards an impending normalization of Boeing-China relations.Furthermore, Chinas aspirations to manufacture its own commercial planes, such as the narrowbody C919, still rely heavily on American suppliers. A complete severing of ties with Boeing would not only be detrimental to China's aviation industry. Still, it could also lead to retaliatory measures from the U.S., potentially impacting China's homegrown aviation aspirations.The situation can be described as a balancing act for Boeing. On one hand, the China market offers an enormous opportunity, not just in terms of new orders but also as an essential part of the supply chain for Chinese commercial aviation projects. On the other hand, geopolitical tensions and the historical 737 MAX issues provide a layer of complexity and risk.The MAX factorIt's essential to remember the broader context: Boeing has almost 5,000 undelivered planes in its backlog, equivalent to years of demand.While the MAX jet faced worldwide grounding between May 2019 and November 2022 due to two deadly crashes, it has been back in service without significant incidents.Although lagging behind Airbus's competing A220 and NEO series, Boeing's MAX retains substantial market interest, with over 7,000 orders.ConclusionBoeing is at a crossroads. While it faces significant challenges in meeting its short-term objectives, long-term prospects offer hope, particularly in emerging markets like China and Vietnam. For investors, the Boeing paradox presents a high-risk, high-reward scenario that demands scrutiny and, perhaps, a measure of cautious optimism.Therefore, the stock remains attractive based on its 2025/2026 targets and the sheer size of its backlog. However, investors must prepare for more bad news in the short term while keeping an eye on third-quarter earnings for updated guidance.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

TXT shares soared a solid 4.9% in the last trading session to reach $79.37 on Sep 20, 2023, thereby reflecting investors’ optimism about this stock following its latest order win from the NetJets airline. Textron has clinched a record-breaking deal for delivering up to 1,500 additional Cessna Citation business jets to NetJets over 15 years.Over the course of its history, NetJets has received and added more than 800 private jets from Textron to its fleet. The recent agreement further strengthens Textron’s 40-year long-standing customer relationship with NetJets.The latest order not only extends NetJets’ current fleet agreement but also introduces options for acquiring a growing number of aircraft each year. This facilitates the expansion of its fleet to include the Cessna Citation Ascend, Citation Latitude and Citation Longitude models. This bolsters Textron’s revenue generation prospects.Can Textron Sustain Such Order Demand?TXT’s Textron Aviation unit manufactures, sells and services the Cessna family of business aircraft. The company witnesses a significant order flow for its jets manufactured at Textron Aviation due to their ability to combine reliability, efficiency and comfort with advanced technology and class-leading performance. Textron Aviation’s backlog of $6.8 billion at the end of the second quarter bears testimony to its robust order intake.With that being said, its Cessna Citation family of jets has evolved to offer an unmatched range of capabilities, systems and options that allow customers to expand their business reach. This has resulted in the strong demand for these jets, which currently have six Citation models in production — Citation M2 Gen2, Citation CJ3+, Citation CJ4 Gen2, Citation XLS Gen2, Citation Latitude and Citation Longitude.To further boost its Cessna Citation line of midsize-class jets, Textron is currently developing Citation Ascend. Deliveries are expected to begin in 2025, and NetJets will be the launch customer for the same.Story continuesGiven the high demand, TXT recently announced its plans to add 16,000 square feet to its Interior Manufacturing Facility to effectively meet the accelerating demand for unique and custom Cessna and Beechcraft aircraft interiors. The expansion will allow Textron Aviation to enhance production efficiency across its entire range of Cessna Citation jets, ease the manufacturing process of new models and efficiently meet the latest order it won from NetJets.Growth ProspectsAs businesses are expanding globally, the need for efficient and flexible air travel increases, making private jets an attractive option. Per the report from GlobeNewswire, the global business and private jet market is poised to witness a CAGR of 16.2% over the 2023-2033 period.Such abounding growth prospects tend to benefit Textron as the company boasts a strong portfolio of business jets that offers a seamless progression of aircraft with extraordinary capabilities.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Southern Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.38bUS$1.90bUS$2.44bUS$3.92bUS$4.88bUS$5.74bUS$6.49bUS$7.13bUS$7.66bUS$8.11bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 24.39%Est @ 17.72%Est @ 13.05%Est @ 9.78%Est @ 7.49%Est @ 5.89% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$1.3kUS$1.7kUS$2.0kUS$3.1kUS$3.6kUS$4.0kUS$4.3kUS$4.4kUS$4.5kUS$4.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$33bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.1b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$207bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$207b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$114bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$147b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$71.2, the company appears quite undervalued at a 47% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Southern as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SouthernStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electric Utilities market.Shareholders have been diluted in the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Dividends are not covered by earnings.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Southern, we've compiled three relevant factors you should look at:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 4 warning signs for Southern (2 shouldn't be ignored!) we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does SO's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

(NYSE:TEL) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 1st of December to $0.59. This takes the dividend yield to 1.9%, which shareholders will be pleased with. See our latest analysis for TE Connectivity TE Connectivity's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. However, prior to this announcement, TE Connectivity's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 35.4% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 29% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendTE Connectivity Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.84 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.36. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 11% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. TE Connectivity has impressed us by growing EPS at 14% per year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for TE Connectivity's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.We Really Like TE Connectivity's DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.

As a result, they are looking to maybe pull back their spending on things like clothing and accessories. UBS U.S. Softline and Luxury Analyst Jay Sole, who conducted the research, says ""all the softline companies are going to be impacted."" ""What we're seeing is a broad-based slowdown... across all demographic groups,"" Sole tells Yahoo Finance Live. However, Sole says given that there has been a bit of an inventory build-up and that he expects demand will slow down even more, there could be more promotions for consumers to take advantage of. If you want to find out which companies Sole likes right now, watch the video above.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: New market research from UBS showing consumer demand for soft goods is weakening. Now, the investment firm bearish on clothing stocks due to a weaker spending outlook. For all things clothing, outerwear, and linens, we want to bring in the author behind that note, Jay Sole, UBS's North America soft lines and luxury analyst joining us. Now, Jay, it's good to see you. So you and the team were out talking to consumers, asking them about their spending plans over the next several months. What did you find?JAY SOLE: Yeah. Well, thanks for having me on the show. What we found is that consumers are really feeling cautious. You know, they're still seeing a lot of inflation. You know, they're worried about things like having to repay student loans. And as a result, they're thinking that they're going to pull back on spending on discretionary items like apparel, footwear, and accessories. And we think that's going to be a headwind for stock prices.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. I mean, certainly sounds like it, Jay. Who are some of the companies that could be most impacted by this in your purview?Story continuesJAY SOLE: What's interesting is I think that really all the soft line companies are going to be impacted, whether we're talking about department stores or brands or off-price retailers or mall-based retailers. You know, what we're seeing is a broad-based slowdown not just among say specific income demographic groups, but it's really across all income demographic groups. And really, everybody buys clothing. So it's something that we think is going to impact the group as a whole.SEANA SMITH: Jay, are we going to see more promotional activity as a result?JAY SOLE: Absolutely, for two reasons. Number one is that there's still too much inventory out there. I think retailers have been surprised by how slow demand has been already this year. And that's created a little bit of a build up of inventory. But then going forward, we think the demand is going to slow down even more.So even though retailers have taken a more cautious view on the amount of inventory they've bought for the Christmas shopping season, they're still going to have too much. And when there's too much inventory out there, that leads to promotions and discounts because that's what retailers have to do to sell it.BRAD SMITH: In your note, you talk about some of the companies with the best go-it-alone growth potential-- Nike, On Holding, Deckers. Walk us through the thesis there and how you're kind of defining this go-it-alone strategy.JAY SOLE: Yeah. So that's a great point. The stocks we like are the brands that can really distribute their goods and sell directly to consumers, meaning through their own stores, their own websites, and essentially cut out the middleman. And that's a way to sort of increase profits and have a more direct relationship with consumers.Brands like Nike have-- companies like Nike have invested, you know, literally billions of dollars to improve their direct-to-consumer business, to make their apps more appealing for consumers to shop at. And we think that's the wave of the future. We saw a little bit of rebound in store traffic the last couple of years as the world reopened after the pandemic.But what we've seen during the back-to-school shopping season is that online sales growth rates are starting to pick up. We're starting to see that market share shift back to online. You know, we think that's the wave of the future. And that's how these companies that you mentioned are positioned. And that's one reason we really like them.]"

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 75% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Wells Fargo. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Wells Fargo. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Wells Fargo's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Wells Fargo. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.3% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.2% of the company stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 25 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Wells Fargo &amp; Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$112m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 25% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Republicans prize its conservative-leaning audience, but critics accuse it of bias and say it has made U.S. politics more toxic.Trump is far and away the front-runner for the Republican nomination. If he is selected as the Republican nominee, he would face Biden in a November 2024 general election.""This provides an opportunity for a reset between President Trump and the Fox News network,"" Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said of Lachlan Murdoch's appointment. ""The question is: does Lachlan Murdoch want to have a positive relationship with former President Donald Trump? Or does he want to see how things play out?""Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment about political coverage under Lachlan Murdoch. Trump does still appear occasionally on Fox News, and gave an interview to the network's chief political anchor, Bret Baier, in June.Story continuesAn aide to Donald Trump said any response to Rupert Murdoch stepping down would come from Trump himself on his Truth Social media platform. Trump had not made any comment by Thursday evening.Jason Osborne, an adviser to the former Republican president's 2016 campaign, said he hoped Lachlan Murdoch and other Fox executives would seek to boost Trump coverage and that both sides could mend ties.""The only path up is regaining those viewers that they lost. And the viewers that they lost veer more towards Trump,"" Osborne said. ""I think there will be outreach if it hasn't already occurred.""Fox executives in 2021 decided to more forcefully rebut Trump's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him through voter fraud, a conspiracy theory that fueled the Capitol Hill riot. Fox lost Trump-supporting viewers to smaller, right-wing cable networks such as Newsmax and One America News Network after the decision.NOT 2016 AGAINFox was a cheerleader for Trump in his ultimately successful 2016 White House campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton, a symbiotic relationship that continued up to the 2020 election.Trump boosted Fox's ratings, while Fox boosted Trump politically, said Larry Stuelpnagel, an associate professor of journalism and political science at Northwestern University and a former broadcast journalist.Dan Cassino, a politics professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, said he does not believe Fox's coverage of Trump will return to 2016 levels. But he added indications are that Lachlan Murdoch is not anti-Trump and as Trump remains the front-runner, coverage of him will likely be ""high volume"".During the Dominion litigation, documents emerged in which Lachlan Murdoch instructed Fox News executives to rein in critical coverage of Trump after he lost the 2020 election.Analysts said those could be heat-of-the-moment instructions over ratings, rather than a vision for how he wanted to cover Trump in the future.Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist, said Fox's support of Trump's election lies had been costly, but she was skeptical the network would fundamentally change when it comes to Trump. ""Their coverage continues to peddle in misinformation and conspiracy theories,"" Finney said.Stuelpnagel said he believed the high cost of the Dominion lawsuit might make Lachlan Murdoch tread carefully on Trump coverage.""The Dominion lawsuit cost them dearly,"" Stuelpnagel said. ""I think Lachlan is going to be more cautious in how he deals with Trump. I don't see a wholesale change in the direction of network.""

It is the vehicle through which the elder Murdoch controls News Corp and Fox Corp, through a roughly 40% stake in voting shares of each company. Murdoch also holds a small amount of shares of the companies outside of the trust.Upon Rupert’s death, News Corp and Fox Corp voting shares will be transferred from Murdoch to his four oldest children – Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James – creating a scenario in which three of the children could out-vote a fourth, potentially setting up a battle over the future of the companies, even as Lachlan Murdoch runs Fox Corp and is the sole chair of News Corp.This tension would likely play out over the future of Fox News, one of the most polarizing properties in the Murdoch empire, and an influential force in U.S. politics, particularly among Republicans who prize Fox's conservative-leaning audience.While Lachlan Murdoch does not speak publicly about his political views, James Murdoch has been more forthright. In January 2020, he and his wife Kathryn took aim at both News Corp and Fox Corp for downplaying the impact of climate change, widely viewed as a contributing factor to the Australian bushfires, in a statement to The Daily Beast.In a July 31, 2020 letter tendering his resignation from News Corp’s board of directors, which was disclosed in a News Corp filing, James Murdoch said he was resigning ""due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.""Story continuesMultiple media outlets, including the New York Times, Vanity Fair and the Financial Times, have reported on tension between the brothers over the direction of Fox and other family-controlled media outlets.In a 2021 FT interview, James Murdoch appeared to slam the channel without naming Fox News in comments about the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol siege. “The sacking of the Capitol is proof positive that what we thought was dangerous is indeed very, very much so,” he said. “Those outlets that propagate lies to their audience have unleashed insidious and uncontrollable forces that will be with us for years.”The Murdoch Family Trust has eight votes: four of which are controlled by Murdoch, and the remaining four controlled by the four children from his first two marriages. Murdoch’s youngest daughters Chloe and Grace, from his third wife Wendi Deng, do not have voting rights in the trust.Upon succession, the four older children will equally inherit Murdoch’s voting shares in the trust, according to Alice Enders, head of research at Enders Analysis.In addition to shares in News Corp and Fox, the trust also includes the Cruden family farm near Melbourne and Murdoch’s art collection, according to a January 2023 Financial Times report.Fox and News Corp have a dual-share system, with non-voting Class A shares and voting Class B shares. The shares in Fox and News Corp owned by Murdoch’s children through the trust are a combination of both classes of shares.“It’s not like a real succession scenario right now, this minute,” said Enders. “It’s more in the future I’d say.”(Reporting by Helen Coster in New York and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Stephen Coates and Marguerita Choy)]"

""He has been in lots of ways a controversial figure, but an influential figure too, and this is an end of an era at News.""Foreign Minister Penny Wong, asked by reporters in New York about Murdoch's exit, said ""any fair-minded observer might say that some of the papers might not exactly be cheerleaders of the Labor Party, but that's what happens in a democracy"".""I wish him well for his retirement,"" she added.Australian politicians no longer in office took a less measured approach. Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a moderate conservative, said ""the business pages will give him credit"" for the success of Fox and News Corp ""but he has done enormous damage to the democratic world"".""The anger-tainment ecosystem that Fox News, above all, has created in the U.S. has left America angrier and more divided than it's been at any time since the civil war,"" Turnbull told the ABC.Murdoch's exit cuts a native tie between News Corp and Fox Corp and Australia, where Murdoch was born. His son Lachlan Murdoch, who becomes sole chairman of News Corp and continues as chair and CEO of Fox, was born in Britain.However, Lachlan Murdoch, whose wife is Australian, continues to live in Sydney with his family and commute to the U.S. where the two companies are based, a spokesperson said.Australia, in return, continues to play an outsize role for Murdoch's companies.It was a campaign led by his Australian newspapers that prompted the country's government in 2021 to force tech giants Meta and Google owner Alphabet to pay media outlets for content displayed on their websites, since they attracted advertising dollars.The U.S. and Canada now plan similar laws.A year earlier, News Corp's coverage of devastating Australian bushfires questioned the role of global warming and drew a rebuke from Murdoch's other son, James Murdoch. He quit the company's board, citing disagreements over editorial content, a few months later.($1 = 1.5569 Australian dollars)(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Jamie Freed)]"

He felt the lot was the beating heart of the company on the West Coast, one steeped in Hollywood history. Besides, he sensed the Century City land would only grow in value, a belief that has proved true (it's worth billions).Now, the 52-year-old executive is firmly presiding over the empire his father built — encompassing the most influential conservative media institutions in America — from an office suite on the L.A. studio lot.Fox Corp. and News Corp. on Thursday announced Rupert Murdoch was stepping down from his executive role at the two media companies and that Lachlan would succeed him atop the two companies. The changes take effect in November.Lachlan Murdoch becomes the sole chairman of News Corp., the publishing company that owns the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, and executive chairman of Fox, the television arm that includes Fox News, Fox Sports and the Fox broadcast network. Because Lachlan Murdoch has been at the helm as Fox's chief executive since March 2019, and because he is exceedingly close to his father, analysts expect the son's strategy to largely reflect the father's.""Lachlan is probably the most aligned with his father in terms of politics and in terms of his vision of the business,"" Paul Verna, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, said. ""There's not a lot of daylight between the two men.""Story continuesLachlan Murdoch has previously said the political bent of Fox News, which has made the network a lightning rod, will remain.Fox documents from late 2020 and early 2021, revealed in the course of high-profile and devastating litigation, underscored the tight collaboration between the two Murdochs. The pair were involved in overseeing Fox News' coverage of President Trump and his false statements that the 2020 election was stolen from him, which proved costly for the company. In April, Fox agreed to pay $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems to avoid a trial over defamation claims.Documents in the case showed how the Murdochs and Fox News Media Chief Executive Suzanne Scott in November 2020 discussed ways to avoid further alienating viewers after Fox News made the early and accurate call that Arizona had tipped to then-candidate Joe Biden.The situation ""needs constant rebuilding without any missteps,” Lachlan Murdoch wrote, according to the internal documents, referring to the company's effort to regain trust among Fox News fans.Read more: Murdoch has survived scandal after scandal. Will Dominion-Fox News lawsuit be different?But there are differences between the pair, beyond the generational gap.In fact, for a while, Lachlan Murdoch appeared uninterested in working with his father — at a time when his younger brother James dived into his corporate role with relish. Back then, it looked like James was in line for the throne.Rupert Murdoch has long made clear that one of his two sons would ultimately succeed him. Beyond wanting to keep his business in the family, the elder mogul is known among friends for his lack of sentimentality, buying and discarding properties that he once coveted, including the Hollywood movie studio known for ""Avatar"" and ""Titanic,"" DirecTV and the European satellite television service Sky.When he was CEO, he worked in an expansive office on the fifth floor of a modern office building on the lot.In contrast, Lachlan prefers the ground-floor office of the Depression-era Art Deco structure, Building 88 on Fox's Avenue of the Palms, where movie pioneer Darryl F. Zanuck once ran the show. Inside his office, a bank of TV screens flicker with Fox News and other channels. Editions of the company's newspapers are proudly and neatly displayed nearby.Lachlan Murdoch and Rupert Murdoch watch the U.S. Open tennis championships in 2018. (Adrian Edwards / GC Images)Lachlan Murdoch is fulfilling the career trajectory that his father mapped for him. Just as Rupert Murdoch had done seven decades before, after his father — a respected Australian news editor and former war correspondent Sir Keith Murdoch — died when Rupert was in his early 20s and left him a small Australian publishing company.""My father firmly believed in freedom, and Lachlan is absolutely committed to the cause,"" Rupert Murdoch wrote in a letter to the staffs of the two companies.Murdoch's message reads, in many ways, like a rallying call to his troops against so-called elites. The elder mogul has long seen himself as a provocateur, chiding news organizations he viewed as too bloated, too high-brow and too liberal.For decades, Rupert Murdoch has fashioned himself as a counterbalance to the media establishment. He's never shied away from using his outlets to influence politics and governments — in his native Australia, Britain and the U.S.""The battle for the freedom of speech and, ultimately, the freedom of thought, has never been more intense,"" Rupert Murdoch wrote in his letter. ""Elites have open contempt for those who are not members of their rarefied class. Most of the media is in cahoots with those elites, peddling political narratives rather than pursuing the truth.""Read more: Fox oral history: Inside the legendary studio at the end of its runIn some ways, Murdoch's letter also felt like a mandate to preserve his legacy.There have been tensions within family, and the succession battle that played out behind the scenes was intense at times, providing fodder for HBO's fictional drama, ""Succession."" Some observers have openly wondered whether the final episodes of the real-life Murdoch succession saga have truly been written yet.Although the elder mogul is pulling back from executive responsibilities at News Corp. and Fox, segueing into chairman emeritus, he retains the family's controlling voting shares of the two companies through a family trust, according to regulatory filings. Rupert Murdoch has the voting control of the trust, through its investment vehicle.Control of the trust will be passed to his four oldest children — Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James — after Murdoch dies. They will each have voting shares. Murdoch's two daughters from his marriage to Wendi Deng each have a financial stake, but not voting shares.The siblings, particularly Lachlan and James, haven't always been aligned in business priorities or in politics.James Murdoch served as chief executive of 21st Century Fox until its 2019 sale to the Walt Disney Co. After working 23 years in the family enterprise, he no longer had an executive role. Three years ago, James stepped down from News Corp.'s board, citing ""disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.""Read more: Legendary Fox Studio Lot set for $1.5-billion expansion For much of the last decade, Rupert Murdoch has been intent on entrusting Lachlan with the enterprise.After he graduated from Princeton, the London-born Lachlan joined the family business in Australia, working at some of their newspapers. Within a few years, he was scaling the ladder at the company in the U.S.In 1999, he was named head of the printing operations in the U.S. and served for a time as publisher of the New York Post during 9/11.He abruptly resigned in 2005, after souring on the corporate politics and moved with his wife, Sarah, and their children back to Australia to build his own profile in media there.In 2015, at his father's urging, Lachlan returned to the U.S. to work alongside him in the company.Fox credits Lachlan Murdoch with savvy business moves, including initially making an $11-million investment in the Australian real estate insights company, REA Group, in which News Corp. now has a majority stake. The publicly traded firm is now worth $8 billion, and News Corp. has a 61% stake.While running Fox in 2020, Lachlan Murdoch championed the $440-million acquisition of Tubi, a free advertising-supported television streaming service, which is now one of the most popular in the country. This year, Bloomberg News reported that Murdoch turned down unsolicited offers of more than $2 billion for the service.But the media landscape is particularly challenged, and it will be up to Lachlan Murdoch to steer the enterprise through those difficulties, including cord-cutting and declining ratings for linear television.""The changes the media industry has been through, and will continue to go through, are monumental,"" Verna said. ""The biggest one is how do you monetize streaming as the cable bundle erodes? That's not a small challenge, but it will be one that Lachlan will face.""Sign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.

Born in London to Murdoch and his second wife, Anna, he grew up steeped in the media business. In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corp’s “Dynasties” program, he said that every morning, before catching the school bus, he and his siblings would read the morning papers - The New York Post, The New York Times, the Daily News and the Wall Street Journal - with his father flagging stories of interest, ordering: “Read that.”The best way to capture their father’s attention in the evenings was to talk about media or politics, according to Paddy Manning’s 2022 biography, “The Successor.” As Lachlan Murdoch got older, he would spend summers working in the family business, cleaning the presses for Sydney’s “Daily Mirror,” or working as a cub reporter for the “San Antonio Express-News.”A rivalry between Lachlan and his younger brother, James, played out from an early age, where even family Monopoly games “were intense and everybody was prepared to cheat,” according to one published account.Lachlan Murdoch and his siblings attended Dalton, a private school on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, and other elite schools, including Trinity School. There, he formed the Trinity Conservative Society, “In an attempt to create a healthy balance between all points of view,” according to one yearbook entry cited by Manning.Story continuesHe graduated from Princeton in 1994 with a degree in philosophy, and entered the family business. He spent three years in Australia, ascending the corporate ladder to become chairman of News Ltd.In 1999, Lachlan Murdoch assumed responsibility for print operations in the U.S. He rose to deputy chief operating officer at News Corp, overseeing the U.S. television stations group and publishing assets, including the New York Post. Many saw him as being trained to assume the corporate reins as his father’s successor.He abruptly resigned in 2005, creating questions about who would succeed Rupert Murdoch at the helm of the media empire he had assembled from a single newspaper in Australia. Lachlan Murdoch founded Illyria Pty, a private investment company, whose acquisitions included a network of Australian radio stations. In 2015, he returned to the family business, sharing the title of co-chairman of 21st Century Fox with his brother, James.The sale of Fox’s entertainment assets to Walt Disney in 2019, in a $71-billion transaction, shrank the size of the Murdochs’ once-vast media holdings. The newly constituted Fox was reduced to a handful of assets, including the Fox broadcast network, Fox News, Fox Sports and Fox Business, with Lachlan Murdoch serving as its executive chair and chief executive officer.Brother James Murdoch left Fox with the close of the Disney transaction.As chief executive of Fox Corp since 2019, Lachlan Murdoch has presided over the media properties during seismic change in the industry, as viewers cut cable subscriptions in favor of streaming services. Even so, Fox News has largely maintained its rating dominance, in part because of its appeal among politically conservative-leaning American viewers.Lachlan Murdoch does not speak publicly about his politics, according to an article in the New York Times magazine. The article cited the 2016 memoir ""Making Headlines,"" by Chris Mitchell, longtime editor of The Australian, as saying “Lachlan’s conservatism is more vigorous than that of any Australian politician” and that his views were usually to the right of his father’s.A Fox spokesperson called that ""just speculation,"" adding ""I wouldn't want to put a political label on him, but wouldn't be unfair to categorize him as a conservative.""James Murdoch has been more public about his political views. In January 2020, he and his wife Kathryn took aim at both News Corp and Fox Corp's coverage of climate change, widely viewed as a contributing factor to the Australian bushfires, in a statement to The Daily Beast. Citing ""disagreements over certain editorial content,"" James resigned from the News Corp board in July 2020.Fox’s loyalty to its conservative-leaning viewers became a hot-button issue during discovery for Dominion Voting Systems’ lawsuit against Fox. The voting technology firm claimed Fox perpetuated falsehoods about its voting machines to appease its viewers who supported former U.S. President Donald Trump. Fox settled the lawsuit for $787.5 million in April, avoiding a trial in which Lachlan and his father were expected to testify.In public remarks in the weeks following the settlement, Lachlan said Fox had been acting as a news organization reporting on the newsworthy events of the day, and recommitted to Fox’s programming strategy.While Rupert Murdoch built his legacy pursuing the television, movie and newspaper businesses with equal abandon, Lachlan’s legacy is still taking shape. In calls with investors, he often becomes animated when speaking about Tubi, an ad-supported streaming service that the company acquired for $440 million in 2020, and which is now valued at $3 billion.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles and Helen Coster in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Nick Zieminski)]"

What to know about the media magnate's successor and family,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rupert-murdochs-children-know-media-205745550.html,1695329865,STORY,"['NWSA', 'FOXA']","[NEW YORK (AP) — Media magnate Rupert Murdoch on Monday announced that he would be stepping down as the leader of both Fox News' parent company and his News Corp media holdings — with his son, Lachlan, set to take his place.Through his decades-long career, Murdoch, 92, built an empire — beginning with his father's newspaper in Adelaide, Australia — and became a multibillionaire. In the U.S., his creation of Fox News has notably influenced American politics, making Murdoch a hero to some and pariah to others.Over the years, Murdoch's family has also risen into the spotlight — accompanied by stories of vindictive business tactics and inter-family rivalries. Murdoch and his family, particularly children James, Lachlan, Elisabeth and Prudence, were said to be the model of the HBO show “Succession.”Murdoch has been married four times and shares six children with three of his wives.WHO IS LACHLAN MURDOCH?Lachlan Murdoch is one of Murdoch's sons with his second wife, Anna. With his father stepping down, Lachlan is set to become News Corp. chairman and continue as chief executive officer of Fox Corp., home to conservative news network Fox News, the Fox broadcast and sports networks, and local TV stations.Lachlan has been CEO for Fox Corp. since 2019, following Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox. Before the merger, he served as executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, starting in 2015 — while his brother, James, was CEO of Fox's then-entertainment business in what analysts described as a competitive power-share concocted by their father.Lachlan rose to executive ranks of the family business, then known collectively as News Corp, in the 1990s and early 2000s. While serving as deputy chief operating officer from 2000 to 2005, his titles also included chairman of Fox Television Stations and publisher of the New York Post.According to CNN, Lachlan temporarily left over a battle with former top executive Roger Ailes about the network's direction in 2005 — before returning as 21st Century Fox executive chairman about a decade later. During his hiatus, he founded private investment company Illyria Pty.Story continuesWHO IS JAMES MURDOCH?James Murdoch is Lachlan's younger brother, also among the children from their father's second marriage.In addition to his time as CEO at 21st Century Fox, James held various executive positions at News. Corp over the years, but later resigned from family-controlled publisher’s board over content appearing in its newspapers, which include the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post.In his 2020 resignation, James — known as the more liberal Murdoch brother — said he stepped down “due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.” James had previously criticized News Corp’s editorial decisions and said he disagreed with Fox News coverage.Before his time in the family business, James dropped out of Harvard University in 1995 to develop a record label, Rawkus Records, which was later bought by News Corp, according to several news reports.In the years following, he served as CEO of Star India, CEO of Sky (then British Sky Broadcasting) and chairman of Sky. James was embroiled in the 2011 News of the World phone hacking scandal along with his father, but both Murdochs denied responsibility.WHO IS ELISABETH MURDOCH?Elisabeth Murdoch is the eldest child of Murdoch's second marriage.Like her brothers, Elisabeth began working her way through the family business decades ago and was poised to take on similar responsibilities — but was not granted the same leadership roles and later began her own media ventures.In the late '90s, Elisabeth served as managing director of Sky Networks for British Sky Broadcasting but left the company in the 2000s after being overlooked for the position of chief executive, according to news reports at the time.A year later, she launched her own independent production company, Shine, which was acquired by News Corp in 2011. This initially brought her into a more prominent position in the family business, but her role was diminished when Shine later merged with Endemol in a joint venture and she stepped away from day-to-day operations.In 2019, Elisabeth co-founder global content company Sister, and has remained active as an entrepreneur and philanthropist across the entertainment and creative industries.WHO IS PRUDENCE MURDOCH MACLEOD?Prudence Murdoch MacLeod is Murdoch’s oldest child from his first wife, Patricia.Unlike some of her half-siblings, Prudence has not showed the same interest in rising to the top the family business — but she has the same stake in the family trust as Lachlan, James and Elisabeth as well as an equal say in what happens to the trust’s voting stock in both companies upon Murdoch’s death.Prudence didn’t completely distance herself from News Corp and has still held several roles within the company over the years. She recently sat on the board of Times Newspapers, Ltd. from December 2010 to March 2022, according to the U.K. publisher’s website. Times Newspapers is a subsidiary of News UK, which is owned by News Corp.WHO ARE GRACE AND CHLOE MURDOCH?Grace and Chloe Murdoch are Rupert Murdoch’s youngest children, whom he shares with his third wife, Wendi Deng.According to media reports and their LinkedIn accounts, Grace attends Yale University and Chloe is a student at Stanford University. The two are beneficiaries of ample non-voting shares being held in a separate trust.____Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives funding from the Quadrivium foundation, founded by James and Kathryn Murdoch.

(FOX, FOXA) and News Corp. (NWS, NWSA) in November. Transitioning into an honorary role as chairman emeritus, what new directions could Murdoch's long-standing media empire take without him at the helm?Huber Research Partners Managing Director Douglas Arthur joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Fox's business outlook and the passing of the torch to Lachlan Murdoch as sole chairman of both companies.""Lachlan has run it in a very focused fashion — they've been conservative, they have a ton of cash, they've done minimal acquisitions,"" Arthur says. ""He has not gone down the [direct-to-cable] subscriber route, which is extremely expensive.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- Douglas, let me start just with the news. What did you make of it, Douglas? Were you surprised at all?DOUGLAS ARTHUR: Yeah, I was surprised. You know, you're always surprised because Rupert's had such a strong presence at both companies. But you know, when you think about it, he's 92 years old. And there have been some examples of media moguls hanging on too long. I mean, Sumner in his later years was still introducing the call, the earnings calls. And he really wasn't particularly articulate.So Rupert is in good health, so he claims. And he's 92. This is the time. And I'd also say since fox was spun out of Disney/21st Century Fox in 2019, this has been Lachlan's show. I mean, he's run this company fairly firmly. And so I don't see a big earthquake here. This is a smooth transition.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, Douglas, with that said, this does come at a tough time for Fox. Specifically, we're talking about the exit of Tucker Carlson, we are talking about the Dominion case. You look at on the print side of things, ""The Wall Street Journal,"" you know, questions about where they're going to continue to bring in revenue on that front as well. Where do you think Lachlan Murdoch then now moves the company? Given that he has been largely at the helm, are we likely to see any difference or any shakeup in strategy?Story continuesDOUGLAS ARTHUR: Well, listen, I can't say definitively what's going to happen. You know, does this mean a C change in strategy? I think, they're-- and frankly, I don't cover News Corp. My partner does, Craig Huber. I think this has greater ramifications for News Corp than it does for Fox. News Corp is a kind of gangly set of unrelated assets that were sort of stuck together in part to protect the future of Rupert's cherished newspapers. And so there, you could see a lot more happening.In the case of Fox when they were spun out, I think there was this fear that Rupert was going to use it as a platform to rebuild a global media empire. Actually, the exact opposite has happened. Lachlan has run in a very focused fashion. They've been very conservative. They have a ton of cash. They've done minimal acquisitions. One of the acquisitions they did was Tubi, which is an AVOD. He is not going down the DTC subscriber route, which is extremely expensive. AVOD is capital light. And that's closing in on $1 billion run rate in revenue. So let's not forget that. That's a very strategic asset for them.- And Douglas, so it sounds like you think pretty well so far of Lachlan Murdoch's leadership. As you noted, they've got a tons of cash. As they as they navigate this streaming landscape, Douglas, what are their other advantages they have there?DOUGLAS ARTHUR: Well, I think-- look, I mean, you guys talked about it up front. They've got 8% declines in their subs in the cable business. And if you look at the correlation between affiliate revenue growth in the cable segment for them and the stock price relative performance, it's quite high. So that's a real issue.I think what Lachlan stresses is they're building the content around must-see sports and news. And arguably, Fox News, you can agree or disagree with its approach to the world, but it is it is must-see TV for a large group of viewers. So entertainment has become a very small part of the picture there.So I think they feel good with how they're positioned in the video ecosystem. I think it's fair to say with this drag on affiliate on subscriber growth, that is a strategic issue, which is weighed on the stock rightly so. And how do they navigate around that? Does Tubi just overwhelm it over time? I think that's one of their kind of strategic levers right now.]"
218,af4f0b69-c924-374f-ae43-648cba950b4f,PYPL,2023-09-22,10 Worst Performing Currencies in Asia,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-worst-performing-currencies-asia-165538149.html,1695315338,STORY,"['PYPL', 'MA']","[In this article, we discuss the 10 worst performing currencies in Asia. If you want to read about some more worst performing currencies, go directly to 5 Worst Performing Currencies in Asia. Asian currencies have been some of the worst affected as economic uncertainty sweeps across the world because of persistent inflation, rising geopolitical tensions, and a rapidly changing power dynamic between the North and the South. The influence of China and Russia on economies in Asia is also one of the prime reasons behind the weak performance of Asian currencies. Although the West has tried to squeeze the Russian economy to extract military benefits, most of the problems associated with the Chinese economy come from domestic troubles. Even large corporations in the US like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) are cautious of investments overseas in the wake of these developments. For example, Western sanctions on Russia have increased energy prices around the world since Russia is one of the biggest energy exporters not only to Europe but to Asia as well. Alongside energy, Russia is also a top food supplier to the globe. Even though Russian authorities are offering energy and food at discounted prices to tackle Western sanctions, there have been few takers, mostly only for publicity. Russian setbacks in Ukraine and a mutiny in Moscow have also done little to allay the concerns of Russian allies in Asia who are looking towards Moscow to ease their currency troubles. These events, combined with a strong US dollar, have pushed Asian currencies down. The South Korean Won, the Chinese Yuan, the Syrian Pound, and the Thai Baht have been some of the worst affected. Asian economies are tied closely to China and a real estate slowdown in the country pressured Asian currencies this year. However, earlier this week, the central bank in China announced that it would keep benchmark lending rates unchanged. The decision was in line with expectations as the government seeks to further stabilize the economic reopening following stringent COVID-19 restrictions. A weakening yuan in the open market has reduced governmental urgency to lower interest rates for growth. Xing Zhaopeng, a senior China strategist at financial services firm ANZ, has said that the growth forecast for China for the next two years has been revised to above 5% from around 4% earlier. Story continuesAsian currencies have, however, been hit hard by news from the other side of the Pacific. In the United States, the Federal Reserve chose not to raise rates further but indicated a further hike may be on the way in the coming months, boosting investor confidence in Treasury yield figures and the strength of the US dollar. The dollar index jumped above 105.5 following the news, the highest it has been in more than six months. This resulted in a mass selloff in Asian markets. Benchmark indexes in Singapore and South Korea were down nearly 1% following the Fed announcement. The currencies in Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Pakistan, Thailand, and a host of other Asian economies were also down. A fall in exports for Asian nations, mostly due to countries around the world allocating higher amounts for essentials such as food and energy, has also hit the Asian currency market. For example, research by trading firm KCM indicates that oil prices are at a ten-month high and inflation remains rampant across Singapore. Per data, the non-oil exports of the country have been falling in this environment, dropping to an eleven-month low in the beginning of September. Other Asian economies are also showing signs of a slide, with stocks in Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand dropping amid hawkish US central bank commentary on the economy. Treasury yields in the United States are one of the reasons why there has been investor aversion towards Asian markets which are loaded with risk. Since the first interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve in March 2022, the Treasury Yield has almost doubled. Presently, it is around 4.36%, as measured by the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note. This is the highest it has been in sixteen years. Asian currencies are expected to continue to face pressures from higher yields in the US, a strong dollar, loose monetary policies, and strong inflation in the coming months. Our MethodologyIn this article, we will list the 10 worst performing currencies in Asia. The ranking is calculated by calculating the percentage decrease in value of the currencies in terms of the US dollar value. The currencies in which the percentage decrease in value in terms of the US dollar are the highest are considered the worst performing. Data for this purpose has been taken from foreign exchange company XE. An initial data set comprising the 30 worst currencies in Asia with the highest value against the US dollar on January 2, 2023 was used. The percentage decrease was calculated by comparing this value against the worth of the currency against the US dollar on September 20, 2023. Digital coins were excluded from the list. The complex exchange rate figures have been rounded up for further clarity. 10 Worst Performing Currencies in AsiaCopyright: kikujungboy / 123RF Stock PhotoWorst Performing Currencies in Asia10. South Korean WonPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 1272 Price Against 1 USD on September 20, 2023: 1326Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 4%South Korean Won is the official currency of South Korean, a tiny country between China and Japan that is a major electronics hub for the rest of the world. Even as famous brands like Samsung contribute nearly a fourth of the total GDP of the country, the currency of the Korean nation has been on a wild ride this year due to pressures from Chinese economic data as well as interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve in the United States. The Won is often used as a proxy for trades in the Chinese Yuan, since China has strict currency controls. The dramatic devaluation of the Yuan has thus pressured the Won this year. The Korean economy is dependent on China in trade as well, and a slowdown in the Chinese economy this year has resulted in a slowdown in Korea too, devaluing the Won. Top firms like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) are all cautious on Asian investments ahead of the fourth quarter as Asian currencies feel the heat of a worsening food and energy crisis globally. 9. Chinese YuanPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 6.9 Price Against 1 USD on September 20, 2023: 7.3Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 6%Chinese Yuan is the official currency of China, one of the largest economies in the world. The Yuan has come under a lot of pressure this year due to several reasons. Some of these include the selling of Chinese stocks by investors outside of China, economic data figures from Beijing that have disappointed investors, widening yield differentials with the United States, and corporate dividend payments. The Chinese currency is one of the worst performing in Asia this year when measured against the US Dollar. However, when measured against other powerful currencies, it holds surprisingly steady. Beijing has put in place strong currency controls to limit capital outflows and reduced the amount of foreign reserves needed for large corporations to continue to function in order to shore up some confidence in the market. 8. Malaysian RinggitPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 4.40 Price Against 1 USD on September 20, 2023: 4.70Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 7%Malaysian Ringgit is the legal tender in Malaysia, a country in East Asia that has historically performed strongly against the US dollar, especially in the past three decades. Per reports, the almost 5% decline in the Ringgit this year last happened during the Asian financial crisis twenty-five years ago. Some of the reasons that the Ringgit has performed so badly this year include rising political uncertainty in the country, the strong demand for the US dollar worldwide amid soaring energy prices, a fall in exports for Malaysia, and the reliance of the Malaysian economy on China. Inaction on part of the government to control currency trades has also devalued the currency. 7. Uzbekistani SomPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 11229 Price Against 1 USD on September 20, 2023: 12163Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 8.3%Uzbekistani Som is the official currency of Uzbekistan, a country in Central Asia. Ever since getting independence from the Soviet Union, the country has strongly relied on Russian trade for economic stability. This is perhaps one of the reasons why the Uzbek currency has devalued against the US dollar this year. The Russian economy has come under heavy pressure amid the war in Ukraine, an internal mutiny in Moscow, and a ban on Russian energy exports. This has pummeled currencies that take their cue from the Russian Ruble. Uzbek authorities are mulling measures to attract more foreign investment to shore up the currency freefall. 6. Japanese YenPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 130Price Against 1 USD on September 20, 2023: 147Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 13%Japanese Yen is the official currency of Japan. In recent months, despite foreign currency inflows from exports, the Yen has come under pressure due to rising food and energy prices globally. Rising oil and gas prices are one of the reasons why the import bill of the country has gone up, and the government has been borrowing money to meet expenses. High Treasury yields in the US and a strong dollar are also decreasing interest in Asian market assets.Top firms like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) are all cautious on Asian businesses ahead of the fourth quarter as Asian currencies feel the heat of a worsening food and energy crisis globally.  Click to continue reading and see 5 Worst Performing Currencies in Asia. Suggested Articles:11 Best Wine Stocks To Buy13 Best Materials Stocks To Buy12 Countries That Produce the Best CoffeeDisclosure.

The strategy involves looking beyond its core beer portfolio to build powerful brands in fast-growing categories, without hampering the support for its existing large brands. Since its launch, the Beyond Beer strategy has been successful in transforming Molson Coors into a total beverage company, with exposure beyond the beer market.The company’s aspiration to become a total beverage company positions it to draw consumer interest when they are looking for alternatives. This has been the key reason for the success of the Beyond Beer approach.Latest Support to Beyond BeerIn the past two months, Molson Coors took another step forward to expand its Beyond Beer portfolio, with a deal in place to acquire Kentucky-based Blue Run in August and the extension of its agreement with ZOA Energy in September.The company signed an agreement to acquire Blue Run Spirits, a finely crafted bourbon and rye whiskey brand. Blue Run is an award-winning whiskey brand launched in October 2020. This marks Molson Coors’ first acquisition in the spirits category.As part of this buyout, TAP will expand its existing spirits business to form Coors Spirits Co., which will house Blue Run, Five Trail Blended American Whiskey, Barmen 1873 Bourbon and other future products. Prior to this, Molson Coors launched Five Trail Blended American Whiskey in 2021 and Barmen 1873 Bourbon in 2022.On Sep 11, Molson Coors extended its partnership with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson’s ZOA Energy to strengthen its beyond beer portfolio. It collaborated with the non-alcoholic energy drink brand for the first time in 2019. ZOA is available at more than 42,000 stores and more than 160,000 points of distribution across the United States and Canada.With this expansion, ZOA will increase media and marketing investment to drive sales and expand distribution to the international markets. Per the deal, Molson Coors will continue to be ZOA’s exclusive distribution partner.Story continuesOther Things to Drive StockThe said acquisition and extension deal not only marks the expansion of the company’s Beyond Beer portfolio, it also highlights its premiumization strategy. The company has been committed to growing its market share through innovation and premiumization. With a view to accelerating portfolio premiumization, it has been aggressively growing its above-premium portfolio in the past few years.Additionally, Molson Coors is on track with its revitalization plan focused on achieving sustainable top-line growth by streamlining the organization and reinvesting resources into its brands and capabilities.Molson Coors delivered on its revitalization plan on a global basis by increasing dollar share in the United States in the second quarter of 2022 for the first time in over a decade. Strength in Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet together resulted in total industry share growth in the United States, driven by brand positionings and better marketing.

The union, which initiated limited strikes at one facility for each car manufacturer on Thursday last week, has stated that more workers will join the strike today if significant progress isn't achieved in negotiations.Analysts Dan Ives from Wedbush and Mike Ward from Benchmark have predicted that a strike expansion is likely due to the apparent gap between the two parties in their negotiations. The UAW's demands include a 40% wage increase over the contract's duration, a shorter workweek without pay reduction, and enhancements to work rules and retirement benefits. In contrast, the automakers are currently offering approximately a 20% pay increase along with cost of living adjustments and some concessions on work rules and retirement funding.The potential extension of strikes could impact key facilities such as GM's Fort Wayne plant in Indiana, which manufactures Chevrolet Silverados; Stellantis' Sterling Heights assembly plant in Michigan, which builds Dodge Ram trucks; and Ford's profitable truck plants in Dearborn, Michigan, and Kansas City, Missouri. An even more damaging scenario would be if the union decides to strike a powertrain plant that supplies multiple assembly plants, effectively shutting them all down.GM President Mark Ruess expressed his concerns about misinformation surrounding the negotiations in an op-ed published on Wednesday. However, UAW president Shawn Fain has rejected proposals from the auto manufacturers and has not yet responded to requests for comments about potential strike expansion plans.The ongoing strike is seen as an attempt by the UAW to unify its members after challenging times marked by the credit crisis, GM bankruptcy, and foreign competition. From 2009 to 2019, wages rose at about 1% per year on average, excluding profit-sharing, according to the Federal Reserve. Over the same period, the U.S. market share of the 'Big Three' dropped from around 45% to 40%.Story continuesIn response to this decline, Ford and GM are planning to regain market share with electric vehicles, especially in the truck and commercial fleet markets. However, increased labor costs could potentially hinder their ability to gain a larger share in the EV market.Since July, when labor issues began to impact investor sentiment, shares in Ford and GM have fallen by around 19% and 15% respectively. On the other hand, Stellantis stock has risen by approximately 10%, although it remains a cheaper stock, trading at less than four times estimated 2024 earnings.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

UAW President Shawn Fain has warned that more of the union's 146,000 members who work at the Detroit Three will join them if new deals are not reached before noon EDT (1600 GMT) on Friday.The standoff is fueling worries about prolonged industrial action that could disrupt production and ripple through the supply chain and dent U.S. economic growth. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday shows significant support by Americans for the striking auto workers.Fain is due to address members on Facebook Live at 10 a.m. EDT, at which time he will outline the plants that will join the strike two hours later.Fain has said the Detroit automakers have not shared their huge profits with workers while enriching executives and investors.GM President Mark Reuss this week rejected those claims, saying the current offer to the union would be generous and the company's profits have been reinvested in the transition to electric vehicles.The automakers have proposed 20% raises over 4-1/2 years, while the UAW is seeking 40%.The union also wants to end a tiered wage structure that it says has created a large gap between newer and older employees.S&amp;P said the strikes, which began on Sept. 15, were highly likely to last several weeks, potentially cutting third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product by 0.39% and causing ""upheaval"" across global automotive supply chains.Story continuesGM, Ford and Stellantis have said they are making contingency plans for further U.S. work stoppages.Ford reached a last-minute deal to avoid a walkout at its Canadian operations late on Tuesday.

Maoli, in turn, expects car prices and repair costs to rise due to the lack of production of new cars.

Well, let's see how it's impacting businesses on the ground and what ripple effects it may have on the consumer going forward. We've got Tom Maoli, an entrepreneur owning multiple car dealerships, including Ford. He's joining us from New Jersey today.Tom, it's good to talk to you today. I realize we're just--TOM MAOLI: Thanks for having me.AKIKO FUJITA: --roughly a week into this-- we're just roughly a week into this strike. But talk to me about how you're watching this as a dealer, checking inventories. What are the contingency plans you're putting in place in the expectation this could go longer?TOM MAOLI: Well, listen, you know, our contingency plans are difficult, because we rely on the manufacturer. And the manufacturer relies on the labor. And you know, the trickle-down effect is devastating to the consumer. And you know, right now we probably, I think, the manufacturers geared up, they knew this was coming. They produced a lot of vehicles. They have a lot of vehicles in the port.But we're talking about a 60, maybe 90-day supply that they have. We're going to burn through that quickly. But the biggest issue that we're faced with is parts. As-- you know, as these plants continue to shut down, you know, Stellantis is already having issues with parts. They can't get parts to produce the cars. And you know, you only need to be missing one part, and you can't finish the car.Story continuesBut you know, what happens is if consumer can't buy cars, they're going to have to repair the cars they have. And if the parts aren't available in the dealers stock ready to go to repair the consumer's car, you're shutting down the transportation system. It's catastrophic. People need to get to work. They need to get their children to school. And it becomes very costly. We're going to see car prices and repair prices rise. They've already risen from the chip shortage and COVID. And now we're going to see it happen again.JOSH LIPTON: And Tom, I'm interested in what demand has been like for you. You know, you hear about the consumer. There's a lot of crosscurrents, Tom. There's, on the one hand, low unemployment and strong wage gains. On the other hand, you know, rising energy prices, higher borrowing costs. What's been business been like for you?TOM MAOLI: Well, listen, demand, you know, supply and demand in the auto industry is very interesting, because an automobile has a life cycle. And you know, during COVID, and a lot of people went out, and they bought their leases out. And that life cycle is coming to an end. You can only drive a car for so long. You can only repair it for so long. And it's coming to an end.We're seeing that in our repair shops. They're busting at the seams. People need new cars. And you know, the strike is going to put another damper on the whole, not only business, on the cost to the consumer. And that's the concern out here. You know, it's the cost of the consumer.And you know, I think, you know, what the unions asking for and what UAW is asking for is unsustainable. You know, yes, the manufacturers have record profits. But you know, they're all chasing this EV insanity that the Biden administration has put forth. Ford is expected to lose $4.5 billion in their EV division this year. You know, if you put that up against their profits, it's not that much. And you know, they continue to be forced to build this infrastructure for EV that the consumers are not adapting to.]"

It should give more money to assembly-line workers, instead.That’s the logic of the United Auto Workers (UAW), which is staging an intensifying strike against GM, Ford, and Jeep parent Stellantis. So far, nearly 13,000 UAW members have walked off the job. The union has threatened other walkouts on a weekly basis and to ratchet up the pain on all three Detroit automakers.The inevitable PR war is breaking out as each side digs in. In the Detroit Free Press on Sept. 20, GM president Mark Reuss said GM has already made a “record offer” to striking workers, while arguing that GM has reinvested the vast majority of its profits in new facilities during the last 10 years. The next day, UAW vice president Mike Booth rebutted those claims, saying GM has been “lavishing Wall Street with the results of our labor,” including stock buybacks. A key plank of the UAW’s demands is that the Detroit Three have been minting profits and need to share more of the lucre with the rank and file.It's true the Detroit Three have enjoyed a nice run of profitability since emerging from the chaos of the Great Recession, when GM and Stellantis forerunner Chrysler declared bankruptcy and Ford nearly did. During the last five years, the Detroit Three combined have earned $99 billion in net income, according to data from S&amp;P Capital IQ.But any amount of profitability is meaningless unless compared with that of competitors. And next to other big automakers, plus upstarts such as Tesla, the Detroit Three don’t look nearly so rich.The following chart shows Detroit Three profitability compared with the biggest automakers in Japan and Europe — Toyota and Volkswagen — along with Tesla, which only makes electric vehicles. GM and Ford trailed the other four in total profits last year, though Stellantis did better. On profit margin, Tesla beats them all, with a 15.4% margin in 2022, compared with 9.4% for Stellantis, 6.3% for GM and -1.3% for Ford, which had a small loss in in 2022.Story continuesHere’s the average profit margin for 11 big automakers during the last 10 years. Toyota’s average profit margin of 7.3% is about as good as it gets for a global automaker operating in every segment. The Detroit Three are considerably below that.Tesla's average margin is negative because it only started earning a profit in 2020. But it now has double-digit margins other automakers can only dream about.What about each company’s future prospects? Past profitability doesn’t tell you much about that, but the stock price is supposed to reflect the market’s best guess about future profitability. By that standard, GM and Ford have been dismal performers, with GM down 15% during the last 10 years and Ford down 29%. The broader market was up 141% during the same time frame.Stellantis has done better, with the stock up 283% since 2013. But that may reflect catch-up from the dismal days when Fiat-Chrysler emerged from Chrysler’s 2009 bankruptcy as a weird US-European mashup, eventually morphing into a company that involves brands as diverse as Jeep, Ram, Fiat, Citroën, Peugeot, Vauxhall, and Maserati.[Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.]The Detroit Three have done well during the last few years because they’ve pared many small, barely profitable vehicles from their US lineups, relying heavily on large trucks and SUVs with hefty margins. Consumers have spent with abandon, aided by low interest rates for several years, then by trillions of dollars in COVID stimulus in 2020 and 2021 meant to keep the US economy going strong.Striking United Auto Workers walk the picket line outside the Ford Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Mich., Sept. 15, 2023. (Rebecca Cook/REUTERS) (Rebecca Cook / reuters)But investors aren’t sanguine about the three automakers’ futures, as the market shifts from the gas-powered models that have dominated for a century to electrics that require completely different technology and massive amounts of up-front investment. Ford says it will lose several billion dollars on EVs this year. General Motors has struggled with technology problems and delayed EV rollouts. Stellantis says EV sales, mostly in Europe, have contributed to profitability, but it still needs deep cost cuts to stay profitable.Tesla is in a different category, given that it has no gas-powered vehicles to transition away from. Yet Tesla burned cash and lost billions before turning its first annual profit in 2020. Tesla’s stock has soared to stratospheric highs because investors think the pain of building robust EV infrastructure is largely in the past and Tesla will eventually displace many legacy automakers. Much of the pain for the Detroit Three, by contrast, is still in the future.The Detroit Three are the only fully unionized automakers in the United States, and they already have higher labor costs than Tesla and all the foreign brands that operate US factories. The UAW is now demanding pay hikes that would raise that cost differential even more.On paper, maybe the Detroit Three can afford to pay workers more and shareholders less. But nobody is asking their competitors to do that, and some of those competitors already enjoy advantages. The Detroit automakers aren’t the titans they used to be, and they’re not the titans the UAW seems to think they are, either.Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

With passenger revenues accounting for most of the top line, airline revenues are moving northwards in the post-COVID-19 scenario.Air travel demand is not only strong on the leisure front (pent-up demand for international travel is the most vital driver of leisure travel), but what is more encouraging is that business travel is coming back as pandemic-related restrictions are removed. Despite the bullish scenario concerning the top line, the Zacks Airline industry has shed 7.1% of its value in a month's time, against the S&amp;P 500's 0.4% uptick.Let's delve deep to unearth the reasons behind the disappointing price performance despite the bright top-line scenario.The northward movement in oil prices is not a welcome development for airline stocks. This is because expenses on fuel represent a significant input cost for airlines. Therefore, an increase in fuel costs hurts bottom-line growth. Recently, oil prices crossed the $90-per-barrel mark for the first time since November. The northward movement in crude price is primarily due to the extension of production cut by Saudi Arabia and Russia through the end of the current year.The sharp rise in one of the primary input costs of airlines is likely to hurt the bottom-line growth of the stocks in the third quarter of 2023. The development has caused key airline stocks, including the likes of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and Spirit Airlines, to increase their September quarter projections for fuel price per gallon.Story continuesAmerican Airlines' management stated that ""fuel prices have increased considerably since the company's initial third-quarter guidance issued on Jul 20, 2023"". American Airlines now expects the fuel cost per gallon (including taxes) in the $2.90-$3.00 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.55-$2.65 range). DAL now expects fuel price per gallon in the $2.75 - $2.90 range (earlier guidance: $2.50 - $2.70).Spirit Airlines' management now expects third-quarter fuel cost per gallon to be $3.06, against the earlier projection of $2.80.  United Airlines now expects the fuel cost per gallon in the $2.95-$3.05 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.5-$2.8 range).As if high fuel costs were not enough, labor costs also increase courtesy of the multiple labor deals witnessed in the space. Given the high air-travel demand and the labor crunch in the post-COVID-19 scenario, the bargaining power of various labor groups has increased.Another headwind has emanated from the devastation caused by wildfire to the Lahaina town in West Maui. This has affected Hawaiian Holdings, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), the most.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Due to the reduced travel demand to Maui from the U.S. Mainland and Neighbor Islands, HA now expects third-quarter 2023 total revenues per available seat miles to decrease 4-7% from third-quarter 2022 levels (prior projection: 2-5% decline).What's Ahead for Airlines?With people again taking to the skies, passenger revenues are likely to remain strong. However, costs are likely to stay high, in turn hurting the bottom-line growth of airlines.The International Energy Agency recently said that the actions of Saudi Arabia and Russia will lead to a supply deficit through the December quarter. This implies that oil prices will remain high, which is a bane for airlines' bottom lines. We expect pay-related deals with labor groups to continue, at least in the near term. Consequently, high labor costs are also likely to eat into profitability.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

This slump followed the company's decision to reduce its financial outlook twice within a span of three weeks.The issue originated from Target's strategy, along with other retailers, to stockpile merchandise to prevent inventory shortages experienced during the early stages of the pandemic. However, once government stimulus checks ceased and most COVID-19 restrictions were lifted in the U.S. in early 2022, consumers shifted their spending habits away from home goods and clothing - Target's primary offerings - towards experiences like dining out and vacations. This shift led to an oversized inventory backlog at Target, resulting in deep discounts that eroded profit margins.The company's Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) margins fell drastically in 2022 to about 3.5%, roughly half of the nearly 7% average maintained over the previous 14 years since the Great Financial Crisis, and lower than even the margin recorded during the crisis year of 2008.However, signs of recovery have emerged in the first half of 2023 with margins improving by approximately 0.9%. Analysts, including D.A. Davidson’s Michael Baker, predict this positive trend will continue with an additional improvement of 0.3% expected in the second half of the year, potentially restoring EBIT margins to around 4.7%.Shipping and distribution costs have been significant factors affecting Target's margins since 2017. In the first half of 2023, these costs were reduced compared to the previous year, contributing to a 0.45% lift in margins.Inventory shrinkage, which includes theft, another challenge for the retail industry has reportedly reached its lowest point and Target expects it to decrease year-over-year by the fourth quarter. Analysts also note that Target's inventory is now healthier, which typically aids merchandise margins. The merchandise mix could be a minor drag next year, but analysts believe that margins should rebound close to 2017 levels and estimate a rise of 1% to reach 5.7% next year, above the consensus of 5.4%.Story continuesIf these forecasts hold true, Target could earn $9.84 per share in fiscal 2024, surpassing the average analyst estimate of $9.04 per share. While only 38% of the 31 analysts tracked are bullish on Target stock, the average analyst price target is $149.21, more than 24% above the current trading level.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this retailer have returned -2.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.9% change. The Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, to which Target belongs, has lost 2.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Target is expected to post earnings of $1.47 per share, indicating a change of -4.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.60 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +26.3%. This estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.01 indicates a change of +18.6% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.7%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Target is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Target, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $25.32 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $107.23 billion and $107.89 billion estimates indicate -0.6% and +0.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTarget reported revenues of $24.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.9%. EPS of $1.80 for the same period compares with $0.39 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.91%. The EPS surprise was +27.66%.Over the last four quarters, Target surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Target is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Target. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It also expects significant improvement in sales and earnings in the second half this year, driven by stronger product offerings, improved on-time shipping performance, and lower ocean freight rates and product costs.The company has been on track to strengthen its e-commerce capabilities through investments to speed up deliveries. Its e-commerce business’s strength continued in second-quarter 2023 on expanded omnichannel facilities, including curbside pickup, same-day pickup, buy online and pickup at store and ship from store. This, along with the easy access to a broad array of online products when shopping in stores, bodes well. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Driven by these factors, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 3.2% in the past three months against the industry's decline of 13.4%.Hurdles on the WayCarter’s is reeling from macroeconomic headwinds, including inflation, higher interest rates, rising consumer debt levels and risk of recession, affecting the demand from consumers and wholesale customers. This resulted in a sluggish year-over-year performance in second-quarter fiscal 2023. Adjusted earnings of 64 cents per share fell from the $1.30 reported in the prior-year quarter. The company reported net sales of $600 million in the second quarter of 2023, which declined 14.3% from the $700.7 million reported in the year-ago period.As a result, management projects fiscal 2023 sales of $2.95-$3 billion compared with the earlier mentioned $3 billion. Notably, it reported net sales of $3.2 billion in the previous year. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are likely to be $5.95-$6.15 compared with the prior stated $6.15. Notably, it reported an EPS of $6.90 in 2022.Adjusted operating income is forecast to be $325-$340 million, down from the previously communicated $350 million. The estimate indicates a decline from the $388.2 million reported in the year-ago period. We expect adjusted operating income to decline 16.2% year over year in 2023.For the third quarter of 2023, net sales are expected to be $770-$790 million, whereas it reported $819 million in the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted earnings are likely to be $1.45-$1.55, suggesting a decline from the $1.68 reported in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating income is expected to be $80-$85 million, implying a dip from the $91.6 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.The third-quarter guidance indicates continued inflationary pressure on consumer demand. The company also expects comparable interest expenses, a higher effective tax rate, SG&amp;A rate deleverage and a lower average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter of 2023.Story continuesConclusionWe believe that Carter’s strategic measures, stronger product offerings, improved on-time shipping performance and robust pricing efforts will play a pivotal role in mitigating the ongoing demand challenges.The P/CF ratio for Carter’s is just 7.65, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 9.28. Clearly, CRI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles. Topping it, a VGM Score of A reflects its inherent strength.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Crocs CROX, Royal Caribbean RCL and MGM Resorts MGM.MGM Resorts currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

247,f7bc8200-8efe-3bd9-97c1-c7229b0649af,RCL,2023-09-22,Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/royal-caribbean-cruises-ltd-rcl-130011219.html,1695301211,STORY,['RCL'],"[Royal Caribbean (RCL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this cruise operator have returned -6.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry, which Royal Caribbean falls in, has lost 4.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Royal Caribbean is expected to post earnings of $3.44 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1,223.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.9%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.14 points to a change of +181.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.31 indicates a change of +35.3% from what Royal Caribbean is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Royal Caribbean is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Royal Caribbean, the consensus sales estimate of $4.03 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +34.5%. The $13.73 billion and $15.53 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +55.3% and +13.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryRoyal Caribbean reported revenues of $3.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +61.3%. EPS of $1.82 for the same period compares with -$2.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.38 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.28%. The EPS surprise was +15.19%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Royal Caribbean is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Royal Caribbean. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

248,f745eb51-26b5-353f-a59a-9372994718a8,RCL,2023-09-22,3 Leisure & Recreation Services Stocks to Buy Despite Industry Gloom,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-leisure-recreation-services-stocks-123700981.html,1695299820,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'LYV', 'RCL']","[The Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry faces challenges due to elevated inflation and a sluggish global economy. However, the industry benefits from optimizing business processes, consistent strategic partnerships and digital initiatives. The robust demand for concerts, improving bookings for cruise operators and higher per capita spending at theme parks are supporting the industry. Industry players like Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. LYV and OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited OSW are likely to gain in their respective fields owing to the factors mentioned above.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry comprises various recreation providers, such as cruise, entertainment and media owners, golf-related leisure and entertainment venue businesses, theme park makers, resort operators and event organizers. Some industry players have ski and sports businesses, while some operate health and wellness centers onboard cruise ships and at destination resorts. Many companies are engaged in hospitality and related businesses. A few of the industry participants also provide weight management products and services. These companies primarily thrive on overall economic growth, which fuels consumer demand for products. Demand, highly dependent on business cycles, is driven by a healthy labor market, rising wages and a growing disposable income.3 Trends Shaping the Leisure &amp; Recreation Services Industry's FutureConcerns of Slowing Global Economy &amp; High Inflation: A slowdown in the global economy is likely to hurt the industry. Inflation in the United States is the biggest challenge for the economy. The consumer price index (CPI) reading for August inched up 0.6% on a monthly basis, higher than July’s rise of 0.2%. Year over year, CPI increased 3.7% in August, higher than the expected rise of 3.6%. This is also the first time since February 2022 that CPI has increased more than 0.6% month over month. Inflationary cost increases in labor, compensation, healthcare, freight and rent lead to higher expenses.Robust Demand Aid Cruise Operators: The cruise industry is benefiting from strong demand for cruising and accelerating booking volumes. The industry is benefiting from solid bookings concerning North America and European sailings. Also, strong pricing (on closer-in-demand) and solid onboard spending bode well for the industry. However, the cruise operators’ operations are likely to be influenced by the uncertainty related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Geopolitical developments have pushed fuel curves higher. Due to the war, most cruise operators have decided to withdraw all activity in Russia.Theme Park Operators &amp; Live Entertainment Companies Bouncing Back: The theme park industry has been benefiting from robust demand. Theme park operators have been gaining from improving visitation. Consumer spending at theme parks continues to rise. Live entertainment firms have benefited from pent-up live event demand and robust ticket sales.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry is grouped within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #180, which places it in the bottom 27% of 246 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries results from a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in the group’s earnings growth potential. Since Aug 31, 2023, the industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have dropped 0.9%.Before we present a few stocks that investors can consider, let’s analyze the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Underperforms the S&amp;P 500The Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite, but has outperformed its sector in the past year. Stocks in the industry have collectively increased 16.5% in the past year compared with the broader sector’s increase of 9.3%. The S&amp;P 500 has risen 17.7% in the said time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing debt-laden leisure service stocks, the industry trades at 54.43X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 19.71X and the sector’s 13.09X. In the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 59.36X and as low as 6.20, with the median being 9.49X, as the charts show.EV/EBITDA Ratio (F12M) Compared With S&amp;P3 Leisure and Recreation Services Stocks Worth Betting OnRoyal Caribbean Cruises: Based in Miami and incorporated in 1985, Royal Caribbean Cruises is a cruise company. The company benefits from the strong demand for Caribbean itineraries, solid close-in bookings at higher prices and the continued strength of onboard spend. Given the full fleet resumption and high-priced load factors, the company expects customer deposits to return to typical seasonality in the upcoming periods. In 2023, the company anticipates solid guest generation from the North America region.Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have surged 104.7% in the past year. In 2023, the company’s sales and earnings are expected to witness growth of 55.1% and 182.1%, respectively, from the prior year’s expected levels. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Price and Consensus: RCLLive Nation Entertainment: The company benefits from pent-up demand for live events, robust ticket sales and the sponsorship and advertising business. The company is optimistic about its growth prospects in 2023. For concerts, the company stated that it has already sold more than 117 million tickets (as of Jun 2023), up 20% from 2022 levels.Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 company have increased 5.2% in the past year. In 2023, the company’s sales and earnings are expected to grow 21% and 57.8%, respectively, from the prior year’s expected levels.Price and Consensus: LYVOneSpaWorld Holdings: The company runs health and wellness centers on cruise ships and at destination resorts worldwide. It is experiencing growth thanks to its innovative approach, exceptional service and unique ability to form cruise line partnerships.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 company have increased 26.7% in the past year.

249,ad35041e-a9cf-3dab-b9be-8fa19e5c815a,RCL,2023-09-22,5 Stocks to Gain From Fed's Decision to Pause Rate Hikes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-gain-feds-decision-120900583.html,1695298140,STORY,"['IHG', 'RCL', 'LYV', 'HGV', 'OSW']","[Stocks declined on Sep 20 as the Federal Reserve hinted at another quarter-percentage-point rate hike this year. Also, the Fed cut its forecast for rate cuts from four to two in 2024. This raised concerns that higher interest rates will create pressure on the economy.However, the Fed, as expected, kept interest rates unchanged in its September meeting, keeping its benchmark interest rates in the range of 5.25-5.5%, which is definitely a good sign as borrowing costs, despite being high, remain intact for some time.This will give consumers more freedom to spend freely as demand for goods and services continues to be high despite price pressures. Given this situation, investing in consumer discretionary stocks like Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. LYV, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited OSW, Hilton Grand Vacations HGV and InterContinental Hotels Group PLC IHG will be a wise decision.Fed Keeps Interest Rates UnchangedAlthough the Fed hinted at more interest rate hikes, it is likely that there will be only one more hike before the Federal Open Market Committee ends its current monetary tightening cycle. Moreover, investors unsure about when the Fed will start its rate cut also do not have a clear picture.While many had expected that the first interest rate cut would not come before 2025, the Federal Reserve said at the end of its September policy meeting that it plans to have at least two rate cuts in 2024.Although this will keep the benchmark rate above the 5% mark, the economy will likely be under less pressure as it will mark the beginning of lower borrowing costs.The Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged was expected. The Fed has hiked interest rates on 11 occasions since March 2022 by 525 basis points in its bid to curb inflation.Inflation has sharply declined over the past year, more than halving from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Although consumer price and wholesale inflation increased marginally in August, it was primarily because of a surge in oil prices.Story continuesDeclining inflation definitely bodes well for the economy. Moreover, the retail sector has shown resilience over the months despite inflationary pressures as demand for goods and services remains high, with consumers not hesitant about spending more. Also, the holiday season is approaching, which typically sees a surge in retail sales and travel.Given this situation, investing in consumer discretionary stocks will be a prudent choice. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY) has gained 29.4% year to date.Our ChoicesFrom an investment perspective, we have identified four stocks from the consumer discretionary sector that are likely to gain from the pause in interest rate hikes.

Future estimates of the business performance.Is SBA Communications (SBAC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapIs SBA Communications a Value Trap?However, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with SBA Communications should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.43. These indicators suggest that SBA Communications, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding the Altman Z-scoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany OverviewSBA Communications owns and operates almost 40,000 cell towers throughout North America, South America, and Africa. It leases space on its towers to wireless service providers, who install equipment on the towers to support their wireless networks. The company has a very concentrated customer base, with most revenue in each market being generated by just the top few mobile carriers. The company owns more than 17,000 towers in the U.S., which accounted for about three fourths of the company's total revenue in 2022. Internationally, SBA's greatest presence is in Brazil, where it operates roughly 10,000 towers. SBA operates as a real estate investment trust, or REIT.Is SBA Communications (SBAC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapBreaking Down SBA Communications's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of SBA Communications's Altman Z-score reveals SBA Communications's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating SBA Communications's historical data, 2021: -0.68; 2022: -0.75; 2023: -0.69, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates SBA Communications's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.ConclusionWhile SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC) may appear to be undervalued, the company's low Altman Z-Score and declining Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio suggest potential financial distress. Therefore, despite its attractive valuation, SBA Communications may be a potential value trap.

The last hike of 20% to 24 cents per share was announced in July 2023. Over the past five years, it has increased dividends four times, with an annualized dividend growth rate of 8.06%.Considering last day’s closing price of $17.81 per share, the company’s current dividend yield stands at 5.4%. This is impressive compared with the industry’s average of 2.97% and attracts investors as it represents a steady income stream.Regions Financial Corporation Dividend Yield (TTM) Regions Financial Corporation Dividend Yield (TTM)Regions Financial Corporation dividend-yield-ttm | Regions Financial Corporation QuoteApart from dividends, RF has a share repurchase program in place. In April 2022, Regions Financial’s board of directors announced a share repurchase program of up to $2.5 billion of common stock from second-quarter 2022 through fourth-quarter 2024. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company repurchased 725,000 shares for $15 million under this share repurchase plan. Such steady capital distribution activities are likely to stoke investors’ confidence in the stock.As of Jun 30, 2023, it had long-term borrowings of $4.29 billion, whereas its liquidity sources aggregated $52.9 billion. With a record of decent earnings strength and decent cash levels, dividend payments seem sustainable.Further, RF’s strong fundamentals make it an impressive investment option. Net interest income (NII) witnessed a compound annual growth rate of 8.5% over the last three years (2019-2022), with the uptrend continuing in the first half of 2023. The improvement in NII was driven by higher interest rates and solid average loan balance trends, partially offset by higher deposit and funding costs.Story continuesRegions Financial is focused on expanding and diversifying its business operations on the back of investments in varied product offerings and through inorganic expansion efforts. In 2021, the company acquired Clearsight, Sabal Capital and EnerBank USA, which diversified its revenue sources.However, RF’s escalating expenses are likely to hinder bottom-line growth in the upcoming period. Also, loan concentration (57.9% of the total commercial loans in the total loan portfolio) amid an uncertain economy and declining mortgage income are near-term woes.Over the past three months, shares of RF have gained 3.8% compared with the industry‘s rise of 3.1%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research RF currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Republicans prize its conservative-leaning audience, but critics accuse it of bias and say it has made U.S. politics more toxic.Trump is far and away the front-runner for the Republican nomination. If he is selected as the Republican nominee, he would face Biden in a November 2024 general election.""This provides an opportunity for a reset between President Trump and the Fox News network,"" Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said of Lachlan Murdoch's appointment. ""The question is: does Lachlan Murdoch want to have a positive relationship with former President Donald Trump? Or does he want to see how things play out?""Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment about political coverage under Lachlan Murdoch. Trump does still appear occasionally on Fox News, and gave an interview to the network's chief political anchor, Bret Baier, in June.Story continuesAn aide to Donald Trump said any response to Rupert Murdoch stepping down would come from Trump himself on his Truth Social media platform. Trump had not made any comment by Thursday evening.Jason Osborne, an adviser to the former Republican president's 2016 campaign, said he hoped Lachlan Murdoch and other Fox executives would seek to boost Trump coverage and that both sides could mend ties.""The only path up is regaining those viewers that they lost. And the viewers that they lost veer more towards Trump,"" Osborne said. ""I think there will be outreach if it hasn't already occurred.""Fox executives in 2021 decided to more forcefully rebut Trump's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him through voter fraud, a conspiracy theory that fueled the Capitol Hill riot. Fox lost Trump-supporting viewers to smaller, right-wing cable networks such as Newsmax and One America News Network after the decision.NOT 2016 AGAINFox was a cheerleader for Trump in his ultimately successful 2016 White House campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton, a symbiotic relationship that continued up to the 2020 election.Trump boosted Fox's ratings, while Fox boosted Trump politically, said Larry Stuelpnagel, an associate professor of journalism and political science at Northwestern University and a former broadcast journalist.Dan Cassino, a politics professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, said he does not believe Fox's coverage of Trump will return to 2016 levels. But he added indications are that Lachlan Murdoch is not anti-Trump and as Trump remains the front-runner, coverage of him will likely be ""high volume"".During the Dominion litigation, documents emerged in which Lachlan Murdoch instructed Fox News executives to rein in critical coverage of Trump after he lost the 2020 election.Analysts said those could be heat-of-the-moment instructions over ratings, rather than a vision for how he wanted to cover Trump in the future.Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist, said Fox's support of Trump's election lies had been costly, but she was skeptical the network would fundamentally change when it comes to Trump. ""Their coverage continues to peddle in misinformation and conspiracy theories,"" Finney said.Stuelpnagel said he believed the high cost of the Dominion lawsuit might make Lachlan Murdoch tread carefully on Trump coverage.""The Dominion lawsuit cost them dearly,"" Stuelpnagel said. ""I think Lachlan is going to be more cautious in how he deals with Trump. I don't see a wholesale change in the direction of network.""

It is the vehicle through which the elder Murdoch controls News Corp and Fox Corp, through a roughly 40% stake in voting shares of each company. Murdoch also holds a small amount of shares of the companies outside of the trust.Upon Rupert’s death, News Corp and Fox Corp voting shares will be transferred from Murdoch to his four oldest children – Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James – creating a scenario in which three of the children could out-vote a fourth, potentially setting up a battle over the future of the companies, even as Lachlan Murdoch runs Fox Corp and is the sole chair of News Corp.This tension would likely play out over the future of Fox News, one of the most polarizing properties in the Murdoch empire, and an influential force in U.S. politics, particularly among Republicans who prize Fox's conservative-leaning audience.While Lachlan Murdoch does not speak publicly about his political views, James Murdoch has been more forthright. In January 2020, he and his wife Kathryn took aim at both News Corp and Fox Corp for downplaying the impact of climate change, widely viewed as a contributing factor to the Australian bushfires, in a statement to The Daily Beast.In a July 31, 2020 letter tendering his resignation from News Corp’s board of directors, which was disclosed in a News Corp filing, James Murdoch said he was resigning ""due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.""Story continuesMultiple media outlets, including the New York Times, Vanity Fair and the Financial Times, have reported on tension between the brothers over the direction of Fox and other family-controlled media outlets.In a 2021 FT interview, James Murdoch appeared to slam the channel without naming Fox News in comments about the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol siege. “The sacking of the Capitol is proof positive that what we thought was dangerous is indeed very, very much so,” he said. “Those outlets that propagate lies to their audience have unleashed insidious and uncontrollable forces that will be with us for years.”The Murdoch Family Trust has eight votes: four of which are controlled by Murdoch, and the remaining four controlled by the four children from his first two marriages. Murdoch’s youngest daughters Chloe and Grace, from his third wife Wendi Deng, do not have voting rights in the trust.Upon succession, the four older children will equally inherit Murdoch’s voting shares in the trust, according to Alice Enders, head of research at Enders Analysis.In addition to shares in News Corp and Fox, the trust also includes the Cruden family farm near Melbourne and Murdoch’s art collection, according to a January 2023 Financial Times report.Fox and News Corp have a dual-share system, with non-voting Class A shares and voting Class B shares. The shares in Fox and News Corp owned by Murdoch’s children through the trust are a combination of both classes of shares.“It’s not like a real succession scenario right now, this minute,” said Enders. “It’s more in the future I’d say.”(Reporting by Helen Coster in New York and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Stephen Coates and Marguerita Choy)]"

""He has been in lots of ways a controversial figure, but an influential figure too, and this is an end of an era at News.""Foreign Minister Penny Wong, asked by reporters in New York about Murdoch's exit, said ""any fair-minded observer might say that some of the papers might not exactly be cheerleaders of the Labor Party, but that's what happens in a democracy"".""I wish him well for his retirement,"" she added.Australian politicians no longer in office took a less measured approach. Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a moderate conservative, said ""the business pages will give him credit"" for the success of Fox and News Corp ""but he has done enormous damage to the democratic world"".""The anger-tainment ecosystem that Fox News, above all, has created in the U.S. has left America angrier and more divided than it's been at any time since the civil war,"" Turnbull told the ABC.Murdoch's exit cuts a native tie between News Corp and Fox Corp and Australia, where Murdoch was born. His son Lachlan Murdoch, who becomes sole chairman of News Corp and continues as chair and CEO of Fox, was born in Britain.However, Lachlan Murdoch, whose wife is Australian, continues to live in Sydney with his family and commute to the U.S. where the two companies are based, a spokesperson said.Australia, in return, continues to play an outsize role for Murdoch's companies.It was a campaign led by his Australian newspapers that prompted the country's government in 2021 to force tech giants Meta and Google owner Alphabet to pay media outlets for content displayed on their websites, since they attracted advertising dollars.The U.S. and Canada now plan similar laws.A year earlier, News Corp's coverage of devastating Australian bushfires questioned the role of global warming and drew a rebuke from Murdoch's other son, James Murdoch. He quit the company's board, citing disagreements over editorial content, a few months later.($1 = 1.5569 Australian dollars)(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Jamie Freed)]"

Besides, he sensed the Century City land would only grow in value, a belief that has proved true (it's worth billions).Now, the 52-year-old executive is firmly presiding over the empire his father built — encompassing the most influential conservative media institutions in America — from an office suite on the L.A. studio lot.Fox Corp. and News Corp. on Thursday announced Rupert Murdoch was stepping down from his executive role at the two media companies and that Lachlan would succeed him atop the two companies. The changes take effect in November.Lachlan Murdoch becomes the sole chairman of News Corp., the publishing company that owns the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, and executive chairman of Fox, the television arm that includes Fox News, Fox Sports and the Fox broadcast network. Because Lachlan Murdoch has been at the helm as Fox's chief executive since March 2019, and because he is exceedingly close to his father, analysts expect the son's strategy to largely reflect the father's.""Lachlan is probably the most aligned with his father in terms of politics and in terms of his vision of the business,"" Paul Verna, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, said. ""There's not a lot of daylight between the two men.""Story continuesLachlan Murdoch has previously said the political bent of Fox News, which has made the network a lightning rod, will remain.Fox documents from late 2020 and early 2021, revealed in the course of high-profile and devastating litigation, underscored the tight collaboration between the two Murdochs. The pair were involved in overseeing Fox News' coverage of President Trump and his false statements that the 2020 election was stolen from him, which proved costly for the company. In April, Fox agreed to pay $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems to avoid a trial over defamation claims.Documents in the case showed how the Murdochs and Fox News Media Chief Executive Suzanne Scott in November 2020 discussed ways to avoid further alienating viewers after Fox News made the early and accurate call that Arizona had tipped to then-candidate Joe Biden.The situation ""needs constant rebuilding without any missteps,” Lachlan Murdoch wrote, according to the internal documents, referring to the company's effort to regain trust among Fox News fans.Read more: Murdoch has survived scandal after scandal. Will Dominion-Fox News lawsuit be different?But there are differences between the pair, beyond the generational gap.In fact, for a while, Lachlan Murdoch appeared uninterested in working with his father — at a time when his younger brother James dived into his corporate role with relish. Back then, it looked like James was in line for the throne.Rupert Murdoch has long made clear that one of his two sons would ultimately succeed him. Beyond wanting to keep his business in the family, the elder mogul is known among friends for his lack of sentimentality, buying and discarding properties that he once coveted, including the Hollywood movie studio known for ""Avatar"" and ""Titanic,"" DirecTV and the European satellite television service Sky.When he was CEO, he worked in an expansive office on the fifth floor of a modern office building on the lot.In contrast, Lachlan prefers the ground-floor office of the Depression-era Art Deco structure, Building 88 on Fox's Avenue of the Palms, where movie pioneer Darryl F. Zanuck once ran the show. Inside his office, a bank of TV screens flicker with Fox News and other channels. Editions of the company's newspapers are proudly and neatly displayed nearby.Lachlan Murdoch and Rupert Murdoch watch the U.S. Open tennis championships in 2018. (Adrian Edwards / GC Images)Lachlan Murdoch is fulfilling the career trajectory that his father mapped for him. Just as Rupert Murdoch had done seven decades before, after his father — a respected Australian news editor and former war correspondent Sir Keith Murdoch — died when Rupert was in his early 20s and left him a small Australian publishing company.""My father firmly believed in freedom, and Lachlan is absolutely committed to the cause,"" Rupert Murdoch wrote in a letter to the staffs of the two companies.Murdoch's message reads, in many ways, like a rallying call to his troops against so-called elites. The elder mogul has long seen himself as a provocateur, chiding news organizations he viewed as too bloated, too high-brow and too liberal.For decades, Rupert Murdoch has fashioned himself as a counterbalance to the media establishment. He's never shied away from using his outlets to influence politics and governments — in his native Australia, Britain and the U.S.""The battle for the freedom of speech and, ultimately, the freedom of thought, has never been more intense,"" Rupert Murdoch wrote in his letter. ""Elites have open contempt for those who are not members of their rarefied class. Most of the media is in cahoots with those elites, peddling political narratives rather than pursuing the truth.""Read more: Fox oral history: Inside the legendary studio at the end of its runIn some ways, Murdoch's letter also felt like a mandate to preserve his legacy.There have been tensions within family, and the succession battle that played out behind the scenes was intense at times, providing fodder for HBO's fictional drama, ""Succession."" Some observers have openly wondered whether the final episodes of the real-life Murdoch succession saga have truly been written yet.Although the elder mogul is pulling back from executive responsibilities at News Corp. and Fox, segueing into chairman emeritus, he retains the family's controlling voting shares of the two companies through a family trust, according to regulatory filings. Rupert Murdoch has the voting control of the trust, through its investment vehicle.Control of the trust will be passed to his four oldest children — Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James — after Murdoch dies. They will each have voting shares. Murdoch's two daughters from his marriage to Wendi Deng each have a financial stake, but not voting shares.The siblings, particularly Lachlan and James, haven't always been aligned in business priorities or in politics.James Murdoch served as chief executive of 21st Century Fox until its 2019 sale to the Walt Disney Co. After working 23 years in the family enterprise, he no longer had an executive role. Three years ago, James stepped down from News Corp.'s board, citing ""disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.""Read more: Legendary Fox Studio Lot set for $1.5-billion expansion For much of the last decade, Rupert Murdoch has been intent on entrusting Lachlan with the enterprise.After he graduated from Princeton, the London-born Lachlan joined the family business in Australia, working at some of their newspapers. Within a few years, he was scaling the ladder at the company in the U.S.In 1999, he was named head of the printing operations in the U.S. and served for a time as publisher of the New York Post during 9/11.He abruptly resigned in 2005, after souring on the corporate politics and moved with his wife, Sarah, and their children back to Australia to build his own profile in media there.In 2015, at his father's urging, Lachlan returned to the U.S. to work alongside him in the company.Fox credits Lachlan Murdoch with savvy business moves, including initially making an $11-million investment in the Australian real estate insights company, REA Group, in which News Corp. now has a majority stake. The publicly traded firm is now worth $8 billion, and News Corp. has a 61% stake.While running Fox in 2020, Lachlan Murdoch championed the $440-million acquisition of Tubi, a free advertising-supported television streaming service, which is now one of the most popular in the country. This year, Bloomberg News reported that Murdoch turned down unsolicited offers of more than $2 billion for the service.But the media landscape is particularly challenged, and it will be up to Lachlan Murdoch to steer the enterprise through those difficulties, including cord-cutting and declining ratings for linear television.""The changes the media industry has been through, and will continue to go through, are monumental,"" Verna said. ""The biggest one is how do you monetize streaming as the cable bundle erodes? That's not a small challenge, but it will be one that Lachlan will face.""Sign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.

Another 54% this year said it was an important priority.Network reliability still reigns: Just as they did in last year’s survey, first responders revealed that network reliability and speed are still the most important considerations when selecting a communications provider, with almost half of respondents (48%) saying so. More than half (51%) said a reliable and resilient network was most important to them in their day-to-day professional communications.First responders demand a resilient network: Almost three-quarters of respondents (72%) said a reliable and resilient network was most crucial for emergency preparedness and response. Most first responders (74%) believe their agency is either somewhat or very prepared for an emergency but only 17% said they were very prepared.NEW YORK, Sept. 21, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verizon Frontline today revealed the findings of a survey of nearly 2,000 public safety professionals, including first responders from fire and police departments, emergency medical services and emergency management agencies as well as representatives from public safety answering points (PSAPs) and emergency call centers (ECCs).Now in its third year, the Verizon Frontline Public Safety Communications Survey, commissioned by Verizon Frontline and conducted by Lexipol, asked respondents about their current and future technology use, emergency preparedness, and outlook on how 5G and advances in communications technology may impact their work in the field.The findings underscore the value first responders place on network reliability, the evolution of mobility, and the increasing impact of 5G.Reliability still reignsNetwork reliability remains the chief priority for first responders. More than half of survey respondents (51%) cited a reliable and resilient network as the most important factor in their day-to-day professional communications.Story continuesAdditionally, almost half of all first responders (48%) said reliability and speed were the most important factors when choosing a public safety communications provider.“The results of our third annual public safety communications survey once again underscore how important network reliability is to first responders,” said Maggie Hallbach, Senior Vice President, Verizon Public Sector and President, Verizon Frontline. “This is why it’s not surprising that more than 35,000 public safety agencies trust Verizon Frontline to deliver their mission-critical communications capabilities.”Reliability as a priority is even more pronounced within the areas emergency preparedness and response. Almost three-quarters of respondents (72%) stated that a reliable and resilient network was among the three most crucial communications considerations during emergencies.Mobility is evolvingThe devices most used on a daily basis by first responders in the field are smartphones (88%), land mobile radios (80%) and laptops (71%), though the survey revealed that fewer respondents expect to use these devices on a daily basis in five years, with only 84% saying they’d use smartphones daily, 69% saying they’d use land mobile radios daily, and 67% saying they’d use laptops daily.By comparison, the devices less likely to be used on a daily basis by first responders today are more likely to be used on a daily basis in five years. Less than half of respondents (49%) said they used tablets on a daily basis today, but almost two-thirds of them (65%) believed they would use tablets on a daily basis in five years. Forty-three percent use internet-connected vehicles on a daily basis, but 62% believed they would use them daily in five years. Other technologies more likely to be used daily in five years are wearables, drones/robots and Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR).5G is a must-haveAs the prevalence of 5G continues to grow, so does awareness of 5G capabilities among first responders. In this year’s survey, more than three-quarters of respondents (77%) considered 5G to be either an important or a top priority for the future of public safety. Overall, the number of first responders who viewed 5G as a top priority increased by five percentage points (from 18% last year to 23% this year). More and more, first responders see technology enabled by 5G connectivity as critical to public safety.“With more than half of all respondents identifying speed or reliability as the primary benefits of 5G and nearly 80-percent identifying 5G as either a top or important priority for their agency in the near future, there is no doubt first responders are ready to embrace the capabilities and applications enabled by Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband,” said Massimo Peselli, Verizon’s Chief Revenue Officer for Global Enterprise and Public Sector. “From internet-connected vehicles to enhanced situational awareness through real-time sharing of video and images from the front lines…and so much more…Verizon Frontline and 5G are poised to help transform the future of public safety.”Other findings and standout statistics from the survey include the following:Stronger connections wanted: 65% of first responders said they would like a stronger connection in the field, up from 60% last year. This desire for a stronger connection lines up with one of the main concerns of 67% of respondents – having an unreliable network.Smartphones losing dominance: Smartphones are the devices most used by first responders today, with 88% of respondents saying they use smartphones on a daily basis, but that number is declining. Last year, 92% of respondents said they used smartphones daily. Also, only 84% of this year’s respondents said they anticipate using smartphones daily in five years.43% of first responders feel unprepared for cyberattacks43% of first responders expect to use robots on a daily basis in five years (compared to 13% now)For more information on the Verizon Frontline Public Safety Communications Survey, visit https://www.verizon.com/about/news/frontline-public-safety-communications-2023Media Contact:Eric Durie516-382-8219eric.durie@verizon.com]"

This annual global event dedicated to raising awareness and taking action on climate change is one of the most widely watched environmental moments in the world…kind of like seeing who's sitting front row at NYFW. Climate Week is held in partnership with the United Nations during the start of the General Assembly, a series of sessions on topics crucial to the global population from September to December every year.As a fashion company, it's essential that we understand our role in this crucial initiative. You may have heard of Tapestry's ""ESG Strategy"" (ESG stands for environmental, social, and governance) - what we call the Fabric of Change. We think of this as a blueprint for how we'll weave together our business ambitions with our commitments to overcome some of the most pressing issues facing our industry and society at large. During Climate Week, the ""E"" or sustainability part of our blueprint comes into focus as we listen, learn, and share how the fashion industry can lead the way to a future that is both beautiful and responsible.Real change requires bold action. Our journey to lasting, sustainable change includes deep analysis of all of our environmental impacts - emissions, water use and waste to landfill, as well as renewable energy adoption across our operations, environmentally preferred materials and a more resilient supply chain. As the impacts of climate change become more prominent, and in anticipation of the climate challenges of tomorrow, we are working to create a more responsible business model today.Tapestry has four main focus areas, including regenerative agriculture, biodiversity, resource efficiency, and circularity. Scroll down to read more about about efforts in each area.Story continuesRegenerative agriculture is a set of farming and grazing techniques that provides environmental benefits, such as soil health and fertility, biodiversity, water quality, reduced impact on climate change, and social and economic support. Within food and farming systems, standard practices often strip soil of its nutrients and require external inputs to the environment that may cause long term harm. Regenerative agriculture is a different approach to these systems that aims to maintain and rejuvenate grasslands, increase biological diversity, soil health and productivity, and could lead to increased carbon absorption. At Tapestry, we want to source materials that don't just mitigate harm but rather have a real, positive impact on their environment; our partnership with organizations like the Savory Institute that are leading the charge towards regenerative agriculture reflect this commitment.Regenerative agriculture is part of our broader commitment to improving the sustainability of our leather supply chain. For example, we've committed to sourcing at least 90% of our leather from tanneries rated gold or silver by the Leather Working Group, which means that they have achieved the highest environmental standards in the industry. In FY2022, 96% of the leather we sourced was made from these tanneries. By seeking out suppliers that practice regenerative agriculture and produce materials, we are focused on the holistic impact of land management and grazing practices that not only reduce the impact of the leather we use in our products, but also have a net positive impact on the overall environment.You can learn more about regenerative grazing here.Want to see regenerative leather in action? Check out Coach's Rogue bag that is made with regenerative leather.Biodiversity: Fashion's Connection to Nature Biodiversity - essentially all living things on Earth - is the cornerstone of a healthy planet is the cornerstone of a healthy planet, and fashion can play a crucial role in preserving it. The fashion industry relies on various natural fibers, such as cotton, viscose, hemp, and silk, which are derived from different plant species. Tapestry recognizes the impact our business has on our natural environments and know that we have a responsibility to reduce impact in a meaningful and measurable way.We aim to attain 95% traceability and mapping of our raw materials to ensure a transparent and responsible supply chain, and identifying all low-, medium-, and high-risk impacts to biodiversity across our supply chain. Tapestry is a signatory of The Fashion Pact, a global initiative of fashion and textile companies that are committed to stopping global warming, protecting biodiversity, and protecting the oceans. Tapestry has also joined to Textile Exchange's Deforestation-Free Call to Action, in which we commit to sourcing leather from deforestation/conversion-free supply chains by 2030.In FY2022, we launched a $3 million four-year partnership between the Tapestry Foundation and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) designed to accelerate the development of an industry-wide standard to certify deforestation and conversion-free (DCF) leather originating from Brazil as part of Tapestry's commitment to transparency and supply chain traceability.In the first year, the project has restored nearly 11,000 acres of pasture and riparian areas and WWF has held seven training courses to initiate seed collection community projects with 125 rural people reached through these courses (67% women including settlers and local landowners). Native seed collection, which is a key step in the recovery of degraded areas, contributes directly to economic empowerment of rural families, the appreciation of local knowledge, and the empowerment of these women. Women who complete these courses and become involved in seed collection can substantially increase their household income.You can read more about the WWF partnership here and here.Resource Efficiency: Doing More with Less Resource efficiency is a critical aspect of combating climate change, and fashion can contribute by optimizing its production processes. By reducing waste and conserving resources, we can minimize our carbon footprint. This means adopting practices like lean manufacturing, where we only produce what is necessary, and using advanced technologies to maximize material utilization.Tapestry has committed to procuring 100% renewable energy in our company stores, offices and fulfilment centers. Like our emissions reduction strategy, we're focused on reducing our impact on climate change with a focus on renewable energy. For example, our global environments team has been prioritizing a transition to energy efficient LED lights in both new stores and store remodels.In December of 2022, we joined The Fashion Pact's Collective Virtual Power Purchasing Agreement (CVPPA) alongside 11 other brands. In doing so, we commit ourselves to accelerate renewable electricity adoption by investing in new clean energy infrastructure. In FY2022, Tapestry also procured 67% of our energy for stores, offices and fulfillment centers from renewable resources.We also are working to engage directly with our suppliers to support their transition to renewable energy. According to Higg FEM and survey responses from LWG audits, our suppliers reported that 9% of their total electricity consumption came from renewable sources, compared to 7% the year prior.Circularity: Closing the Loop Circularity in fashion is about creating a closed-loop system where products are designed, produced, and disposed of in a way that minimizes waste and extends the lifespan of fashion items. By embracing circularity, we reduce the need for constant production of new garments and decrease the environmental impact of fashion.Longevity is a key factor in all products made by Tapestry's iconic house of brands. We see this as an expression of a future that is both beautiful and responsible. This is one of the reasons Tapestry is staying the course on using leather as a component of so many of our products: Leather is one of the most durable natural materials that can last for generations.In FY2023, Tapestry participated in an $18M funding round for Gen Phoenix, an innovative sustainable materials company. Gen Phoenix uses a patented hydroentanglement technology to create high-quality materials from recycled leather waste- specifically, offcuts from tanneries that might otherwise have been sent to landfill. Read more about our investment here.On a brand level, Coach has offered repairs for their products for 30 years. This repair program supplements what is now a full portion of the brand's business: Coach (Re)Loved. The (Re)Loved program takes Coach products and either restores them to their original glory, upcrafts them into a new, one-of-a-kind product, or repurposes damaged pieces into completely new products. The program has given over 10,000 products a second life and is currently being expanded into China, Japan, and the United Kingdom.The launch of Coachtopia, a sub-brand of Coach that is driven by circular design, is another example of how Coach is implementing circularity into their business model. Coachtopia's products are made from primarily recycled materials and designed to be repaired, reworked, and reimagined.kate spade new york has partnered with ThredUp, one of the largest apparel resale platforms in the world, to create the Pre-Loved Program, in which customers can turn gently used clothes for kate spade shopping credit. In Spring 2023, to coincide with the brands 30th anniversary, we took new steps on our journey to drive progress including reimagining the Sam Icon bag using 100% recycled materials. The new Sam Icon is made with 100% recycled nylon shell on the outside and 100% recycled polyester lining (and love) on the inside.Tapestry is a member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's Fashion Advisory Board, an international organization working to accelerate the transition towards a circular economy, as part of our commitment to innovating and scaling circular business models. As Network Partners as well as members of the foundation, we hope to find areas of opportunity within our businesses and within the fashion industry to implement circularity into how we operate.Climate change affects us all, and it's imperative that we take concrete steps to address it. Let's embrace these sustainable practices not just during Climate Week but as a part of our everyday operations. By doing so, we can pave the way for a more responsible fashion industry and make a positive impact on the world we live in. Tapestry is shaping lifestyles to contribute to a culture of change that will help us realize a better-made future. We can use our collective strengths to help make the fashion industry more sustainable.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Tapestry, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Tapestry, Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/tapestry-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Tapestry, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/786239/embracing-sustainability-fashions-role-in-climate-week]"

Initially built for startups without in-house finance teams, and VCs looking to run financial health checks for their portfolios in Africa, FinanceGPT (Ipoxcap) says it has over the last two years grown to attract a diverse range of clientele including investment managers and finance officers out to fast-track their fiscal reporting.FinanceGPT, which is part of the 2023 Startup Battlefield 200 cohort, leverages its proprietary AI models and GPT-4 to, amongst other capabilities, generate financial ratios that show the overall state of a business, make predictions on future performance and forecast valuations, based on the uploaded accounting data.“It generates a shareable financial analytics dashboard and text-based reports depending on the company's data and user requests,” said CEO Phiwa Nkambule, who co-founded the startup with Sibo Mkhonta (CFO) in 2020.“We started by helping startups organize their finances for investor readiness, but we have seen a demand from portfolio managers, retail traders and company finance teams, who use it to run their investment business or manage their portfolios,” said Nkambule.He added that while the startup has attracted clients from around the globe, its main focus remains Africa. It is currently working on FinanceGPT Patches, entailing three lean language models to seal the financial information gaps and biases of large language modes (LLMs) like GPT-4 on emerging markets. For instance, the FinanceGPT-SSA model is designed to be proficient in native African languages, and is said to ensure accurate financial insights on sub-Saharan Africa markets. Similar models are being built for the Middle East and North Africa, as well as Asia-Pacific.“They are small language models that will work hand in hand with other foundational models to fill the gap that is left by large language models when it comes to developing countries. We know that the macro-economic dynamics are very unique and different in these regions and we want to ensure that this is well captured,” he said.Story continuesFinanceGPT is also working on a financial voice assistant that will be competent in some African languages to deliver financial advisory services.

One-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was -10.87%, and its shares gained 227.72% of their value over the last 52 weeks. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a market capitalization of $1.013 trillion.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the biggest beneficiary this year in terms of its stock run and projected revenue gains. More companies- including, perhaps, some not yet in existence-will certainly join the ranks over time.In the meantime, NVIDIA has emerged as the unrivaled global leader in providing the technologies at the center of the Al arms race. NVIDIA's competitive advantage is the result of investments that began two decades ago, when it recognized an early opportunity to repurpose its video-game graphics chips for the heavy-load computing done in scientific research. This led management to expand the GPU business. It also spent years and significant resources developing a free software platform that's exclusive to its chips called CUDA that allows developers to easily program its GPUs for a variety of computationally intensive applications. Researchers then began using both NVIDIA's chips and CUDA to train the human-brain-inspired neural networks that power Al models.Now, due to an explosion of demand related to generative Al and LLMs from across its customer base, NVIDIA projects that data-center revenue for its fiscal second quarter ending in July will surge to US$11 billion. Not only is that more than double last quarter's total, but the forecast also shattered the average analyst estimate that called for about US$7 billion.

Meanwhile in bonds, the belly of the US Treasury yield curve surged to 15-year highs, highlighting increasing investor risk aversion following Wednesday's Federal Reserve decision.Fed Chair Jay Powell stuck to his guns Wednesday with the ""higher for longer"" mantra and left the Fed's main policy rate unchanged. But he threw tepid water — if not cold water — on expectations that the US economy will avoid recession this cycle.Responding to a reporter question, Powell said that a soft landing is not the Fed's baseline expectation; it's merely a ""plausible outcome.""At the long end of the US yield curve, bond vigilantes are running with the remarks — driving the 10-year near 4.5%, the highest level since 2007.At the short end of the curve, the Fed's policy rate remains restrictive. And ironically, the more inflation cools, the more restrictive the Fed's policy rate will become. That's because the so-called real policy rate is the Fed's overnight benchmark rate minus core inflation.If the Fed holds its nominal policy rate where it currently is while inflation cools, simple math says that the real policy rate will increase. And that's increasingly what the Fed itself is signaling.As Yahoo Finance's Myles Udland noted Thursday in this column, Fed officials now see fewer rate cuts in 2024 and 2025 than they did at their June meeting.""Higher for longer"" effectively means ""restrictive for longer.""In a private note to clients, Alfonso Peccatiello, founder &amp; CEO of TheMacroCompass.com, says that Powell and the Fed are sitting ""between a rock and a hard place,"" making it a ""tricky situation"" for most investors.Story continuesRisk assets like stocks have ""limited upside"" yet bond investors aren't faring much better. For bonds to surge higher, yields would need to decline substantially, which would be mean a hard landing.Peccatiello ominously concludes that bonds can't rally substantially ""unless something breaks for good.""For the stock investors, the surge in yields is bad news for those who rode the megacap stock wave higher earlier in the year. The triple-digit gains of Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Meta (META) are fading, as Apple (AAPL) hovers near five-month lows. Those longer-duration stocks tend to suffer the most when bond yields suddenly move higher.Nasdaq 100 Heat Map - 2 DaysYet, investors have also lost confidence in cyclical stocks, as economic murkiness and headwinds abound.

Per McKesson, MF affects approximately 20,000 patients in the United States, with around 40% of patients already anemic at the time of diagnosis and nearly all patients estimated to develop anemia with time.McKesson’s management believes that OJJAARA will likely address the significant unmet medical needs of MF patients and provide an additional option for treatment.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Straits Research, the global oncology cancer drugs market was valued at $148,050.6 million in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $288,636.6 million by 2030 at a CAGR of 7.7%.

McKesson’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 8.1%.McKesson is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its robust Biologics business. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter fiscal 2024 performance and its strength in the distribution market are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trends persist.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversStrength in Biologics: Investors are optimistic about McKesson’s robust Biologics business. Independent specialty pharmacy, Biologics by McKesson, has been making impressive progress lately. This month, the pharmacy was selected by GSK as a specialty pharmacy provider for OJJAARA (momelotinib).Last month, the pharmacy was selected by Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. as a specialty pharmacy provider for VANFLYTA (quizartinib).Strength in Distribution Market: McKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market, which raises investors’ optimism. The Distribution Solutions segment caters to a wide range of customers and businesses and stands to benefit from increased generic utilization, inflation in generics driven by several patent expirations in the next few years and an aging population.Per management, the uptick in the company’s U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments’ adjusted operating profit was driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government’s COVID-19 vaccine program, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: McKesson’s robust first-quarter fiscal 2024 results buoy optimism. The company recorded robust top-line and bottom-line performances and strength in its U.S. Pharmaceutical, Medical-Surgical Solutions and Prescription Technology Solutions segments.DownsidesWeak Trends: McKesson distributes generic pharmaceuticals, which are subject to price fluctuation. The Distribution Solutions segment continues to experience weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trends. Continued volatility, unfavorable pricing trends, reimbursement of generic drugs and significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches could have a material adverse impact on McKesson.Stiff Competition: Distribution Solutions faces stiff competition both in terms of price and service from various full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large-payer organizations. Moreover, the company depends on fewer suppliers for its products.

Republicans prize its conservative-leaning audience, but critics accuse it of bias and say it has made U.S. politics more toxic.Trump is far and away the front-runner for the Republican nomination. If he is selected as the Republican nominee, he would face Biden in a November 2024 general election.""This provides an opportunity for a reset between President Trump and the Fox News network,"" Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said of Lachlan Murdoch's appointment. ""The question is: does Lachlan Murdoch want to have a positive relationship with former President Donald Trump? Or does he want to see how things play out?""Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment about political coverage under Lachlan Murdoch. Trump does still appear occasionally on Fox News, and gave an interview to the network's chief political anchor, Bret Baier, in June.Story continuesAn aide to Donald Trump said any response to Rupert Murdoch stepping down would come from Trump himself on his Truth Social media platform. Trump had not made any comment by Thursday evening.Jason Osborne, an adviser to the former Republican president's 2016 campaign, said he hoped Lachlan Murdoch and other Fox executives would seek to boost Trump coverage and that both sides could mend ties.""The only path up is regaining those viewers that they lost. And the viewers that they lost veer more towards Trump,"" Osborne said. ""I think there will be outreach if it hasn't already occurred.""Fox executives in 2021 decided to more forcefully rebut Trump's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him through voter fraud, a conspiracy theory that fueled the Capitol Hill riot. Fox lost Trump-supporting viewers to smaller, right-wing cable networks such as Newsmax and One America News Network after the decision.NOT 2016 AGAINFox was a cheerleader for Trump in his ultimately successful 2016 White House campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton, a symbiotic relationship that continued up to the 2020 election.Trump boosted Fox's ratings, while Fox boosted Trump politically, said Larry Stuelpnagel, an associate professor of journalism and political science at Northwestern University and a former broadcast journalist.Dan Cassino, a politics professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, said he does not believe Fox's coverage of Trump will return to 2016 levels. But he added indications are that Lachlan Murdoch is not anti-Trump and as Trump remains the front-runner, coverage of him will likely be ""high volume"".During the Dominion litigation, documents emerged in which Lachlan Murdoch instructed Fox News executives to rein in critical coverage of Trump after he lost the 2020 election.Analysts said those could be heat-of-the-moment instructions over ratings, rather than a vision for how he wanted to cover Trump in the future.Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist, said Fox's support of Trump's election lies had been costly, but she was skeptical the network would fundamentally change when it comes to Trump. ""Their coverage continues to peddle in misinformation and conspiracy theories,"" Finney said.Stuelpnagel said he believed the high cost of the Dominion lawsuit might make Lachlan Murdoch tread carefully on Trump coverage.""The Dominion lawsuit cost them dearly,"" Stuelpnagel said. ""I think Lachlan is going to be more cautious in how he deals with Trump. I don't see a wholesale change in the direction of network.""

282,2e86a5c3-755c-32e9-b68b-e966e69636e6,FOX,2023-09-22,Murdoch Family Trust: The real battle over succession has yet to begin,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/murdoch-family-trust-real-battle-060658156.html,1695362818,STORY,"['FOXA', 'NWSA']","[By Helen Coster and Dawn ChmielewskiNEW YORK (Reuters) -When Lachlan Murdoch, the eldest son of media titan Rupert Murdoch, was named the sole chairman of News Corp and Fox Corp on Thursday, the announcement put to rest immediate questions about who will run a sprawling media empire that includes some of the most powerful brands in the world.The executive transition, however, does not settle another potential power play that could occur upon Rupert Murdoch’s death, as framed by a document called the Murdoch Family Trust.The Reno, Nevada-based trust lays out a scenario through which a potential takeover could occur. It is the vehicle through which the elder Murdoch controls News Corp and Fox Corp, through a roughly 40% stake in voting shares of each company. Murdoch also holds a small amount of shares of the companies outside of the trust.Upon Rupert’s death, News Corp and Fox Corp voting shares will be transferred from Murdoch to his four oldest children – Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James – creating a scenario in which three of the children could out-vote a fourth, potentially setting up a battle over the future of the companies, even as Lachlan Murdoch runs Fox Corp and is the sole chair of News Corp.This tension would likely play out over the future of Fox News, one of the most polarizing properties in the Murdoch empire, and an influential force in U.S. politics, particularly among Republicans who prize Fox's conservative-leaning audience.While Lachlan Murdoch does not speak publicly about his political views, James Murdoch has been more forthright. In January 2020, he and his wife Kathryn took aim at both News Corp and Fox Corp for downplaying the impact of climate change, widely viewed as a contributing factor to the Australian bushfires, in a statement to The Daily Beast.In a July 31, 2020 letter tendering his resignation from News Corp’s board of directors, which was disclosed in a News Corp filing, James Murdoch said he was resigning ""due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.""Story continuesMultiple media outlets, including the New York Times, Vanity Fair and the Financial Times, have reported on tension between the brothers over the direction of Fox and other family-controlled media outlets.In a 2021 FT interview, James Murdoch appeared to slam the channel without naming Fox News in comments about the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol siege. “The sacking of the Capitol is proof positive that what we thought was dangerous is indeed very, very much so,” he said. “Those outlets that propagate lies to their audience have unleashed insidious and uncontrollable forces that will be with us for years.”The Murdoch Family Trust has eight votes: four of which are controlled by Murdoch, and the remaining four controlled by the four children from his first two marriages. Murdoch’s youngest daughters Chloe and Grace, from his third wife Wendi Deng, do not have voting rights in the trust.Upon succession, the four older children will equally inherit Murdoch’s voting shares in the trust, according to Alice Enders, head of research at Enders Analysis.In addition to shares in News Corp and Fox, the trust also includes the Cruden family farm near Melbourne and Murdoch’s art collection, according to a January 2023 Financial Times report.Fox and News Corp have a dual-share system, with non-voting Class A shares and voting Class B shares. The shares in Fox and News Corp owned by Murdoch’s children through the trust are a combination of both classes of shares.“It’s not like a real succession scenario right now, this minute,” said Enders. “It’s more in the future I’d say.”(Reporting by Helen Coster in New York and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Stephen Coates and Marguerita Choy)]"
283,15e2fe8c-fe9a-3a3a-bc92-1cd847c6d1c1,FOX,2023-09-22,Rupert Murdoch's exit ends chapter for polarising figure in his native Australia,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rupert-murdochs-exit-ends-chapter-051229168.html,1695359549,STORY,"['FOXA', 'NWSA']","[By Byron KayeSYDNEY (Reuters) - For some Australians, Rupert Murdoch's exit from the leadership of his media empire was a time to reflect on the country's greatest business success story.For others, it was a welcome reduction of influence for a man they viewed as a danger to democracy, and indeed, the planet.But as the country that produced the most powerful modern media figure processed the news he was stepping down as chairman of Fox Corp and News Corp, a consensus view quickly formed that there would never be another like him.""For one bloke to lead the world's most powerful family, build a A$30 billion ($19 billion) family fortune, and influence global affairs for decades is extraordinary,"" said Stephen Mayne, a former News journalist turned shareholder activist who has grilled Murdoch about the company's dealings at 15 annual meetings since 1999.""Sadly, certainly in recent years, so much of that legacy has been toxic,"" added Mayne, citing Murdoch outlets' amplification of 2020 U.S. presidential election falsehoods and questioning of climate science, among other things.The populist conservative media empire which Murdoch built over seven decades from a single Adelaide newspaper spreads across three continents but its influence remains unrivalled in Australia, where some 60% of daily newspapers, including national broadsheet The Australian, are News Corp-owned.Even at a time when media consumption is splintering from traditional routes, particularly among younger people, Murdoch's influence is embedded in the country's information ecosystem because of its massive reach, media experts said.His local properties include Sky News Australia, a cable TV channel fashioned on the partisan style of U.S. network Fox News.""What you publish in the Australian gets a second bounce through Sky gets a third bounce through the state daily papers,"" said Shane Homan, head of Monash University's media, film and journalism school.Story continues""The Murdoch papers still have that key reach with working-class demographics that can still be influential,"" he said.That was why Australian politicians across the ideological spectrum continued to pursue friendly relationships with the company, unlike in other markets where left-leaning lawmakers were more likely to avoid it, Honan added.POLITICAL REACTIONFederal Treasurer Jim Chalmers, asked by the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) if Murdoch's newspapers had treated his left-leaning Labor party unfairly, said he wouldn't discuss ""whether or not I feel stories or coverage have been fair"".""The body of work is there for all to see,"" Chalmers told the broadcaster. ""He has been in lots of ways a controversial figure, but an influential figure too, and this is an end of an era at News.""Foreign Minister Penny Wong, asked by reporters in New York about Murdoch's exit, said ""any fair-minded observer might say that some of the papers might not exactly be cheerleaders of the Labor Party, but that's what happens in a democracy"".""I wish him well for his retirement,"" she added.Australian politicians no longer in office took a less measured approach. Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a moderate conservative, said ""the business pages will give him credit"" for the success of Fox and News Corp ""but he has done enormous damage to the democratic world"".""The anger-tainment ecosystem that Fox News, above all, has created in the U.S. has left America angrier and more divided than it's been at any time since the civil war,"" Turnbull told the ABC.Murdoch's exit cuts a native tie between News Corp and Fox Corp and Australia, where Murdoch was born. His son Lachlan Murdoch, who becomes sole chairman of News Corp and continues as chair and CEO of Fox, was born in Britain.However, Lachlan Murdoch, whose wife is Australian, continues to live in Sydney with his family and commute to the U.S. where the two companies are based, a spokesperson said.Australia, in return, continues to play an outsize role for Murdoch's companies.It was a campaign led by his Australian newspapers that prompted the country's government in 2021 to force tech giants Meta and Google owner Alphabet to pay media outlets for content displayed on their websites, since they attracted advertising dollars.The U.S. and Canada now plan similar laws.A year earlier, News Corp's coverage of devastating Australian bushfires questioned the role of global warming and drew a rebuke from Murdoch's other son, James Murdoch. He quit the company's board, citing disagreements over editorial content, a few months later.($1 = 1.5569 Australian dollars)(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Jamie Freed)]"

He felt the lot was the beating heart of the company on the West Coast, one steeped in Hollywood history. Besides, he sensed the Century City land would only grow in value, a belief that has proved true (it's worth billions).Now, the 52-year-old executive is firmly presiding over the empire his father built — encompassing the most influential conservative media institutions in America — from an office suite on the L.A. studio lot.Fox Corp. and News Corp. on Thursday announced Rupert Murdoch was stepping down from his executive role at the two media companies and that Lachlan would succeed him atop the two companies. The changes take effect in November.Lachlan Murdoch becomes the sole chairman of News Corp., the publishing company that owns the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, and executive chairman of Fox, the television arm that includes Fox News, Fox Sports and the Fox broadcast network. Because Lachlan Murdoch has been at the helm as Fox's chief executive since March 2019, and because he is exceedingly close to his father, analysts expect the son's strategy to largely reflect the father's.""Lachlan is probably the most aligned with his father in terms of politics and in terms of his vision of the business,"" Paul Verna, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, said. ""There's not a lot of daylight between the two men.""Story continuesLachlan Murdoch has previously said the political bent of Fox News, which has made the network a lightning rod, will remain.Fox documents from late 2020 and early 2021, revealed in the course of high-profile and devastating litigation, underscored the tight collaboration between the two Murdochs. The pair were involved in overseeing Fox News' coverage of President Trump and his false statements that the 2020 election was stolen from him, which proved costly for the company. In April, Fox agreed to pay $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems to avoid a trial over defamation claims.Documents in the case showed how the Murdochs and Fox News Media Chief Executive Suzanne Scott in November 2020 discussed ways to avoid further alienating viewers after Fox News made the early and accurate call that Arizona had tipped to then-candidate Joe Biden.The situation ""needs constant rebuilding without any missteps,” Lachlan Murdoch wrote, according to the internal documents, referring to the company's effort to regain trust among Fox News fans.Read more: Murdoch has survived scandal after scandal. Will Dominion-Fox News lawsuit be different?But there are differences between the pair, beyond the generational gap.In fact, for a while, Lachlan Murdoch appeared uninterested in working with his father — at a time when his younger brother James dived into his corporate role with relish. Back then, it looked like James was in line for the throne.Rupert Murdoch has long made clear that one of his two sons would ultimately succeed him. Beyond wanting to keep his business in the family, the elder mogul is known among friends for his lack of sentimentality, buying and discarding properties that he once coveted, including the Hollywood movie studio known for ""Avatar"" and ""Titanic,"" DirecTV and the European satellite television service Sky.When he was CEO, he worked in an expansive office on the fifth floor of a modern office building on the lot.In contrast, Lachlan prefers the ground-floor office of the Depression-era Art Deco structure, Building 88 on Fox's Avenue of the Palms, where movie pioneer Darryl F. Zanuck once ran the show. Inside his office, a bank of TV screens flicker with Fox News and other channels. Editions of the company's newspapers are proudly and neatly displayed nearby.Lachlan Murdoch and Rupert Murdoch watch the U.S. Open tennis championships in 2018. (Adrian Edwards / GC Images)Lachlan Murdoch is fulfilling the career trajectory that his father mapped for him. Just as Rupert Murdoch had done seven decades before, after his father — a respected Australian news editor and former war correspondent Sir Keith Murdoch — died when Rupert was in his early 20s and left him a small Australian publishing company.""My father firmly believed in freedom, and Lachlan is absolutely committed to the cause,"" Rupert Murdoch wrote in a letter to the staffs of the two companies.Murdoch's message reads, in many ways, like a rallying call to his troops against so-called elites. The elder mogul has long seen himself as a provocateur, chiding news organizations he viewed as too bloated, too high-brow and too liberal.For decades, Rupert Murdoch has fashioned himself as a counterbalance to the media establishment. He's never shied away from using his outlets to influence politics and governments — in his native Australia, Britain and the U.S.""The battle for the freedom of speech and, ultimately, the freedom of thought, has never been more intense,"" Rupert Murdoch wrote in his letter. ""Elites have open contempt for those who are not members of their rarefied class. Most of the media is in cahoots with those elites, peddling political narratives rather than pursuing the truth.""Read more: Fox oral history: Inside the legendary studio at the end of its runIn some ways, Murdoch's letter also felt like a mandate to preserve his legacy.There have been tensions within family, and the succession battle that played out behind the scenes was intense at times, providing fodder for HBO's fictional drama, ""Succession."" Some observers have openly wondered whether the final episodes of the real-life Murdoch succession saga have truly been written yet.Although the elder mogul is pulling back from executive responsibilities at News Corp. and Fox, segueing into chairman emeritus, he retains the family's controlling voting shares of the two companies through a family trust, according to regulatory filings. Rupert Murdoch has the voting control of the trust, through its investment vehicle.Control of the trust will be passed to his four oldest children — Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James — after Murdoch dies. They will each have voting shares. Murdoch's two daughters from his marriage to Wendi Deng each have a financial stake, but not voting shares.The siblings, particularly Lachlan and James, haven't always been aligned in business priorities or in politics.James Murdoch served as chief executive of 21st Century Fox until its 2019 sale to the Walt Disney Co. After working 23 years in the family enterprise, he no longer had an executive role. Three years ago, James stepped down from News Corp.'s board, citing ""disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.""Read more: Legendary Fox Studio Lot set for $1.5-billion expansion For much of the last decade, Rupert Murdoch has been intent on entrusting Lachlan with the enterprise.After he graduated from Princeton, the London-born Lachlan joined the family business in Australia, working at some of their newspapers. Within a few years, he was scaling the ladder at the company in the U.S.In 1999, he was named head of the printing operations in the U.S. and served for a time as publisher of the New York Post during 9/11.He abruptly resigned in 2005, after souring on the corporate politics and moved with his wife, Sarah, and their children back to Australia to build his own profile in media there.In 2015, at his father's urging, Lachlan returned to the U.S. to work alongside him in the company.Fox credits Lachlan Murdoch with savvy business moves, including initially making an $11-million investment in the Australian real estate insights company, REA Group, in which News Corp. now has a majority stake. The publicly traded firm is now worth $8 billion, and News Corp. has a 61% stake.While running Fox in 2020, Lachlan Murdoch championed the $440-million acquisition of Tubi, a free advertising-supported television streaming service, which is now one of the most popular in the country. This year, Bloomberg News reported that Murdoch turned down unsolicited offers of more than $2 billion for the service.But the media landscape is particularly challenged, and it will be up to Lachlan Murdoch to steer the enterprise through those difficulties, including cord-cutting and declining ratings for linear television.""The changes the media industry has been through, and will continue to go through, are monumental,"" Verna said. ""The biggest one is how do you monetize streaming as the cable bundle erodes? That's not a small challenge, but it will be one that Lachlan will face.""Sign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.

Born in London to Murdoch and his second wife, Anna, he grew up steeped in the media business. In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corp’s “Dynasties” program, he said that every morning, before catching the school bus, he and his siblings would read the morning papers - The New York Post, The New York Times, the Daily News and the Wall Street Journal - with his father flagging stories of interest, ordering: “Read that.”The best way to capture their father’s attention in the evenings was to talk about media or politics, according to Paddy Manning’s 2022 biography, “The Successor.” As Lachlan Murdoch got older, he would spend summers working in the family business, cleaning the presses for Sydney’s “Daily Mirror,” or working as a cub reporter for the “San Antonio Express-News.”A rivalry between Lachlan and his younger brother, James, played out from an early age, where even family Monopoly games “were intense and everybody was prepared to cheat,” according to one published account.Lachlan Murdoch and his siblings attended Dalton, a private school on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, and other elite schools, including Trinity School. There, he formed the Trinity Conservative Society, “In an attempt to create a healthy balance between all points of view,” according to one yearbook entry cited by Manning.Story continuesHe graduated from Princeton in 1994 with a degree in philosophy, and entered the family business. He spent three years in Australia, ascending the corporate ladder to become chairman of News Ltd.In 1999, Lachlan Murdoch assumed responsibility for print operations in the U.S. He rose to deputy chief operating officer at News Corp, overseeing the U.S. television stations group and publishing assets, including the New York Post. Many saw him as being trained to assume the corporate reins as his father’s successor.He abruptly resigned in 2005, creating questions about who would succeed Rupert Murdoch at the helm of the media empire he had assembled from a single newspaper in Australia. Lachlan Murdoch founded Illyria Pty, a private investment company, whose acquisitions included a network of Australian radio stations. In 2015, he returned to the family business, sharing the title of co-chairman of 21st Century Fox with his brother, James.The sale of Fox’s entertainment assets to Walt Disney in 2019, in a $71-billion transaction, shrank the size of the Murdochs’ once-vast media holdings. The newly constituted Fox was reduced to a handful of assets, including the Fox broadcast network, Fox News, Fox Sports and Fox Business, with Lachlan Murdoch serving as its executive chair and chief executive officer.Brother James Murdoch left Fox with the close of the Disney transaction.As chief executive of Fox Corp since 2019, Lachlan Murdoch has presided over the media properties during seismic change in the industry, as viewers cut cable subscriptions in favor of streaming services. Even so, Fox News has largely maintained its rating dominance, in part because of its appeal among politically conservative-leaning American viewers.Lachlan Murdoch does not speak publicly about his politics, according to an article in the New York Times magazine. The article cited the 2016 memoir ""Making Headlines,"" by Chris Mitchell, longtime editor of The Australian, as saying “Lachlan’s conservatism is more vigorous than that of any Australian politician” and that his views were usually to the right of his father’s.A Fox spokesperson called that ""just speculation,"" adding ""I wouldn't want to put a political label on him, but wouldn't be unfair to categorize him as a conservative.""James Murdoch has been more public about his political views. In January 2020, he and his wife Kathryn took aim at both News Corp and Fox Corp's coverage of climate change, widely viewed as a contributing factor to the Australian bushfires, in a statement to The Daily Beast. Citing ""disagreements over certain editorial content,"" James resigned from the News Corp board in July 2020.Fox’s loyalty to its conservative-leaning viewers became a hot-button issue during discovery for Dominion Voting Systems’ lawsuit against Fox. The voting technology firm claimed Fox perpetuated falsehoods about its voting machines to appease its viewers who supported former U.S. President Donald Trump. Fox settled the lawsuit for $787.5 million in April, avoiding a trial in which Lachlan and his father were expected to testify.In public remarks in the weeks following the settlement, Lachlan said Fox had been acting as a news organization reporting on the newsworthy events of the day, and recommitted to Fox’s programming strategy.While Rupert Murdoch built his legacy pursuing the television, movie and newspaper businesses with equal abandon, Lachlan’s legacy is still taking shape. In calls with investors, he often becomes animated when speaking about Tubi, an ad-supported streaming service that the company acquired for $440 million in 2020, and which is now valued at $3 billion.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles and Helen Coster in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Nick Zieminski)]"

What to know about the media magnate's successor and family,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rupert-murdochs-children-know-media-205745550.html,1695329865,STORY,"['NWSA', 'FOXA']","[NEW YORK (AP) — Media magnate Rupert Murdoch on Monday announced that he would be stepping down as the leader of both Fox News' parent company and his News Corp media holdings — with his son, Lachlan, set to take his place.Through his decades-long career, Murdoch, 92, built an empire — beginning with his father's newspaper in Adelaide, Australia — and became a multibillionaire. In the U.S., his creation of Fox News has notably influenced American politics, making Murdoch a hero to some and pariah to others.Over the years, Murdoch's family has also risen into the spotlight — accompanied by stories of vindictive business tactics and inter-family rivalries. Murdoch and his family, particularly children James, Lachlan, Elisabeth and Prudence, were said to be the model of the HBO show “Succession.”Murdoch has been married four times and shares six children with three of his wives.WHO IS LACHLAN MURDOCH?Lachlan Murdoch is one of Murdoch's sons with his second wife, Anna. With his father stepping down, Lachlan is set to become News Corp. chairman and continue as chief executive officer of Fox Corp., home to conservative news network Fox News, the Fox broadcast and sports networks, and local TV stations.Lachlan has been CEO for Fox Corp. since 2019, following Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox. Before the merger, he served as executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, starting in 2015 — while his brother, James, was CEO of Fox's then-entertainment business in what analysts described as a competitive power-share concocted by their father.Lachlan rose to executive ranks of the family business, then known collectively as News Corp, in the 1990s and early 2000s. While serving as deputy chief operating officer from 2000 to 2005, his titles also included chairman of Fox Television Stations and publisher of the New York Post.According to CNN, Lachlan temporarily left over a battle with former top executive Roger Ailes about the network's direction in 2005 — before returning as 21st Century Fox executive chairman about a decade later. During his hiatus, he founded private investment company Illyria Pty.Story continuesWHO IS JAMES MURDOCH?James Murdoch is Lachlan's younger brother, also among the children from their father's second marriage.In addition to his time as CEO at 21st Century Fox, James held various executive positions at News. Corp over the years, but later resigned from family-controlled publisher’s board over content appearing in its newspapers, which include the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post.In his 2020 resignation, James — known as the more liberal Murdoch brother — said he stepped down “due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.” James had previously criticized News Corp’s editorial decisions and said he disagreed with Fox News coverage.Before his time in the family business, James dropped out of Harvard University in 1995 to develop a record label, Rawkus Records, which was later bought by News Corp, according to several news reports.In the years following, he served as CEO of Star India, CEO of Sky (then British Sky Broadcasting) and chairman of Sky. James was embroiled in the 2011 News of the World phone hacking scandal along with his father, but both Murdochs denied responsibility.WHO IS ELISABETH MURDOCH?Elisabeth Murdoch is the eldest child of Murdoch's second marriage.Like her brothers, Elisabeth began working her way through the family business decades ago and was poised to take on similar responsibilities — but was not granted the same leadership roles and later began her own media ventures.In the late '90s, Elisabeth served as managing director of Sky Networks for British Sky Broadcasting but left the company in the 2000s after being overlooked for the position of chief executive, according to news reports at the time.A year later, she launched her own independent production company, Shine, which was acquired by News Corp in 2011. This initially brought her into a more prominent position in the family business, but her role was diminished when Shine later merged with Endemol in a joint venture and she stepped away from day-to-day operations.In 2019, Elisabeth co-founder global content company Sister, and has remained active as an entrepreneur and philanthropist across the entertainment and creative industries.WHO IS PRUDENCE MURDOCH MACLEOD?Prudence Murdoch MacLeod is Murdoch’s oldest child from his first wife, Patricia.Unlike some of her half-siblings, Prudence has not showed the same interest in rising to the top the family business — but she has the same stake in the family trust as Lachlan, James and Elisabeth as well as an equal say in what happens to the trust’s voting stock in both companies upon Murdoch’s death.Prudence didn’t completely distance herself from News Corp and has still held several roles within the company over the years. She recently sat on the board of Times Newspapers, Ltd. from December 2010 to March 2022, according to the U.K. publisher’s website. Times Newspapers is a subsidiary of News UK, which is owned by News Corp.WHO ARE GRACE AND CHLOE MURDOCH?Grace and Chloe Murdoch are Rupert Murdoch’s youngest children, whom he shares with his third wife, Wendi Deng.According to media reports and their LinkedIn accounts, Grace attends Yale University and Chloe is a student at Stanford University. The two are beneficiaries of ample non-voting shares being held in a separate trust.____Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives funding from the Quadrivium foundation, founded by James and Kathryn Murdoch.

What did you make of it, Douglas? Were you surprised at all?DOUGLAS ARTHUR: Yeah, I was surprised. You know, you're always surprised because Rupert's had such a strong presence at both companies. But you know, when you think about it, he's 92 years old. And there have been some examples of media moguls hanging on too long. I mean, Sumner in his later years was still introducing the call, the earnings calls. And he really wasn't particularly articulate.So Rupert is in good health, so he claims. And he's 92. This is the time. And I'd also say since fox was spun out of Disney/21st Century Fox in 2019, this has been Lachlan's show. I mean, he's run this company fairly firmly. And so I don't see a big earthquake here. This is a smooth transition.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, Douglas, with that said, this does come at a tough time for Fox. Specifically, we're talking about the exit of Tucker Carlson, we are talking about the Dominion case. You look at on the print side of things, ""The Wall Street Journal,"" you know, questions about where they're going to continue to bring in revenue on that front as well. Where do you think Lachlan Murdoch then now moves the company? Given that he has been largely at the helm, are we likely to see any difference or any shakeup in strategy?Story continuesDOUGLAS ARTHUR: Well, listen, I can't say definitively what's going to happen. You know, does this mean a C change in strategy? I think, they're-- and frankly, I don't cover News Corp. My partner does, Craig Huber. I think this has greater ramifications for News Corp than it does for Fox. News Corp is a kind of gangly set of unrelated assets that were sort of stuck together in part to protect the future of Rupert's cherished newspapers. And so there, you could see a lot more happening.In the case of Fox when they were spun out, I think there was this fear that Rupert was going to use it as a platform to rebuild a global media empire. Actually, the exact opposite has happened. Lachlan has run in a very focused fashion. They've been very conservative. They have a ton of cash. They've done minimal acquisitions. One of the acquisitions they did was Tubi, which is an AVOD. He is not going down the DTC subscriber route, which is extremely expensive. AVOD is capital light. And that's closing in on $1 billion run rate in revenue. So let's not forget that. That's a very strategic asset for them.- And Douglas, so it sounds like you think pretty well so far of Lachlan Murdoch's leadership. As you noted, they've got a tons of cash. As they as they navigate this streaming landscape, Douglas, what are their other advantages they have there?DOUGLAS ARTHUR: Well, I think-- look, I mean, you guys talked about it up front. They've got 8% declines in their subs in the cable business. And if you look at the correlation between affiliate revenue growth in the cable segment for them and the stock price relative performance, it's quite high. So that's a real issue.I think what Lachlan stresses is they're building the content around must-see sports and news. And arguably, Fox News, you can agree or disagree with its approach to the world, but it is it is must-see TV for a large group of viewers. So entertainment has become a very small part of the picture there.So I think they feel good with how they're positioned in the video ecosystem. I think it's fair to say with this drag on affiliate on subscriber growth, that is a strategic issue, which is weighed on the stock rightly so. And how do they navigate around that? Does Tubi just overwhelm it over time? I think that's one of their kind of strategic levers right now.]"

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 64% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 3.3% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 17% for shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Walt Disney which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Walt Disney. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walt Disney?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Walt Disney. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Walt Disney, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Walt Disney. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.1% of shares outstanding. With 6.7% and 4.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Walt DisneyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Walt Disney Company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$42m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 36% stake in Walt Disney. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Its new headquarters will be spread across roughly eight floors spread across the ""One International Center"" complex in Mumbai's business district of Lower Parel.""It is a marquee deal in terms of area. In Mumbai, rents are so high and every year only three to five such deals happen. This type of relocation is rare,"" said the first source, who said the monthly estimated rent paid by Viacom18 will be 60 million Indian rupees ($722,178).Viacom18 did not respond to a request for comment, while Blackstone declined to comment.Ambani, Asia's richest man, has been fast expanding his media and entertainment empire. He runs TV channels including MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central in India, and his streaming platform competes with the likes of Netflix and Disney+ Hotstar.Viacom18's shareholders include Ambani's Reliance, as well as Paramount Global and Bodhi Tree, a joint venture between James Murdoch and former top Disney executive Uday Shankar.Two of the sources familiar with the office relocation plans said Viacom18 is moving to a new headquarters as it wants to consolidate all its business units - be it tax, finance, sports or digital - in one office.The office relocation is likely to happen before December, they added.Blackstone is also finalising plans to launch an initial public offering of its office portfolio-based real estate investment trust in India, and that will include assets of Nucleus Office Parks, Indian media reported in June.The company has said India is one of its best performing markets. It manages assets worth $50 billion in the country, including in private equity and real estate, and has made over a billion dollars in real estate share sales alone in the past year.

Born in London to Murdoch and his second wife, Anna, he grew up steeped in the media business. In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corp’s “Dynasties” program, he said that every morning, before catching the school bus, he and his siblings would read the morning papers - The New York Post, The New York Times, the Daily News and the Wall Street Journal - with his father flagging stories of interest, ordering: “Read that.”The best way to capture their father’s attention in the evenings was to talk about media or politics, according to Paddy Manning’s 2022 biography, “The Successor.” As Lachlan Murdoch got older, he would spend summers working in the family business, cleaning the presses for Sydney’s “Daily Mirror,” or working as a cub reporter for the “San Antonio Express-News.”A rivalry between Lachlan and his younger brother, James, played out from an early age, where even family Monopoly games “were intense and everybody was prepared to cheat,” according to one published account.Lachlan Murdoch and his siblings attended Dalton, a private school on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, and other elite schools, including Trinity School. There, he formed the Trinity Conservative Society, “In an attempt to create a healthy balance between all points of view,” according to one yearbook entry cited by Manning.Story continuesHe graduated from Princeton in 1994 with a degree in philosophy, and entered the family business. He spent three years in Australia, ascending the corporate ladder to become chairman of News Ltd.In 1999, Lachlan Murdoch assumed responsibility for print operations in the U.S. He rose to deputy chief operating officer at News Corp, overseeing the U.S. television stations group and publishing assets, including the New York Post. Many saw him as being trained to assume the corporate reins as his father’s successor.He abruptly resigned in 2005, creating questions about who would succeed Rupert Murdoch at the helm of the media empire he had assembled from a single newspaper in Australia. Lachlan Murdoch founded Illyria Pty, a private investment company, whose acquisitions included a network of Australian radio stations. In 2015, he returned to the family business, sharing the title of co-chairman of 21st Century Fox with his brother, James.The sale of Fox’s entertainment assets to Walt Disney in 2019, in a $71-billion transaction, shrank the size of the Murdochs’ once-vast media holdings. The newly constituted Fox was reduced to a handful of assets, including the Fox broadcast network, Fox News, Fox Sports and Fox Business, with Lachlan Murdoch serving as its executive chair and chief executive officer.Brother James Murdoch left Fox with the close of the Disney transaction.As chief executive of Fox Corp since 2019, Lachlan Murdoch has presided over the media properties during seismic change in the industry, as viewers cut cable subscriptions in favor of streaming services. Even so, Fox News has largely maintained its rating dominance, in part because of its appeal among politically conservative-leaning American viewers.Lachlan Murdoch does not speak publicly about his politics, according to an article in the New York Times magazine. The article cited the 2016 memoir ""Making Headlines,"" by Chris Mitchell, longtime editor of The Australian, as saying “Lachlan’s conservatism is more vigorous than that of any Australian politician” and that his views were usually to the right of his father’s.A Fox spokesperson called that ""just speculation,"" adding ""I wouldn't want to put a political label on him, but wouldn't be unfair to categorize him as a conservative.""James Murdoch has been more public about his political views. In January 2020, he and his wife Kathryn took aim at both News Corp and Fox Corp's coverage of climate change, widely viewed as a contributing factor to the Australian bushfires, in a statement to The Daily Beast. Citing ""disagreements over certain editorial content,"" James resigned from the News Corp board in July 2020.Fox’s loyalty to its conservative-leaning viewers became a hot-button issue during discovery for Dominion Voting Systems’ lawsuit against Fox. The voting technology firm claimed Fox perpetuated falsehoods about its voting machines to appease its viewers who supported former U.S. President Donald Trump. Fox settled the lawsuit for $787.5 million in April, avoiding a trial in which Lachlan and his father were expected to testify.In public remarks in the weeks following the settlement, Lachlan said Fox had been acting as a news organization reporting on the newsworthy events of the day, and recommitted to Fox’s programming strategy.While Rupert Murdoch built his legacy pursuing the television, movie and newspaper businesses with equal abandon, Lachlan’s legacy is still taking shape. In calls with investors, he often becomes animated when speaking about Tubi, an ad-supported streaming service that the company acquired for $440 million in 2020, and which is now valued at $3 billion.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles and Helen Coster in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Nick Zieminski)]"

Bradley said, ""You have these unrealistic, almost excessive demands on the part of union leadership across a whole host of industry that could ultimately be destabilizing for the entire economy.""Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden discussed the effect of the Hollywood strikes on major studios like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros.

Discovery and other major studios are facing amid the writers and actors' strikes. Weprin said, ""In the short term, they're going to have all this extra cash ... but in the long term they do need new scripted TV shows and movies in order to conduct their daily business.MNTN CEO Mark Douglas broke down the major issues between writers and Hollywood studios, including streaming and AI. Douglas explained, ""I think these studios need to meet consumers where they are, bring the content, consumers will bring the dollars, and we can go forward with everyone entertained.""David Madland, Center for American Progress Senior Fellow and Senior Adviser at the American Worker Project, discussed the resurgence behind strikes and labor unions, as well as the impact on the U.S. economy. Madland said, ""In the short run, a strike is not good for anyone, the workers, the writers lose clearly for a long period of time that they don't get an income.""Art Wheaton, Director of Labor Relations at Cornell University ILR School, explained the motivating factors behind the recent workers strikes. Wheaton said, ""Everybody is looking at the bargaining table as a way to make up for all of the costs and the increased cost of living."" Wheaton added, ""Currently we have a more union-friendly President and that means the labor law tends to be a little more friendly toward the NLRB (National Labor Relations Board).""Video highlights:00:00:03 - Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman00:00:27 - Erica Groshen, Cornell University00:00:40 - Axios Business Reporter Nathan Bomey00:00:58 - U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Neil Bradley00:01:15 - Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden00:01:31 - The Hollywood Reporter Media &amp; Business Writer Alex Weprin00:01:49 - MNTN CEO Mark Douglas00:02:03 - American Worker Project Senior Adviser David Madland00:02:21 - Art Wheaton, Cornell University ILR School]"

Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Portland General Electric has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Exelon has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that POR's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.POR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.39, while EXC has a forward P/E of 17.35. We also note that POR has a PEG ratio of 2.72. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. EXC currently has a PEG ratio of 2.75.Another notable valuation metric for POR is its P/B ratio of 1.38. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, EXC has a P/B of 1.62.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to POR's Value grade of B and EXC's Value grade of C.Story continuesPOR has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than EXC, so it seems like value investors will conclude that POR is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The merger, confirmed during a special meeting of Magellan's shareholders on Thursday, is expected to finalize before the markets open on Monday, September 25, 2023.The agreement was initially reached in mid-May 2023, despite facing opposition from some of Magellan's stakeholders. Concerns were raised about potential tax implications and doubts over the strategic value of the merger. However, the majority of stakeholders supported the deal, outweighing these objections.In order to secure the approval for the merger, it required backing from over half of Magellan's outstanding units. With 55% of these units endorsing the deal, this condition was narrowly met; any abstention was effectively considered a vote against the merger. Notably, Magellan managed to overcome opposition from Energy Income Partners, a significant institutional holder that owns 3% of the units.The deal terms stipulate that Oneok will offer 0.667 of its units and $25 in cash for each Magellan unit. Prior to this announcement, Magellan units were trading around $55 each. As per recent calculations, the deal value aligns with Magellan's trading price at approximately $69.10 per unit.On Thursday morning following the news announcement, both companies experienced a slight dip in market performance. Magellan Midstream Partners' units saw a minor decrease of 0.1%, bringing their value to $69.02 each. Oneok also experienced a decline as its units slipped 1.3% to $66.13 each.Magellan's management had previously succeeded in convincing unit holders that the merger would not only provide a significant premium but also result in a more varied and steady business. Preliminary results from the special meeting indicate that about 76% of the common units cast their votes. Out of these, 111.2 million units, or 55% of the total outstanding units, favored the merger. Oneok's stakeholders also expressed strong support for the agreement.Story continuesThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

That is not good news for beleaguered banks already struggling with steeper funding costs.Keeping central bank rates elevated for an extended period of years will likely increase the pressure on some institutions to become more reliant on costly brokered deposits known within the industry as ""hot money.""These brokered deposits come from outside firms that funnel large amounts of customers to higher-yielding certificates of deposit offered by banks.They are proving to be a critical bank funding source at a time when the Fed’s high rates motivate customers to seek out the highest yields for their cash. But because these deposits are typically more expensive for a bank, they cut into profits during a challenging time for many financial institutions.Brokered deposits across the banking industry surged to $1.2 trillion in the second quarter, according to FDIC data, up 86% from the same period the year before. They accounted for 6.5% of total US bank deposits, the highest percentage in four years.When interest rates go higher, ""brokered certificates of deposits and regular certificates of deposits take up a greater percentage of a bank funding base,"" Gerard Cassidy, banking analyst for RBC Capital Markets, told Yahoo Finance. ""That's just the way it is.""Read more: The best CD rates for September 2023There is a debate within the banking world as to whether brokered deposits are also riskier, with some arguing that new customers are not as loyal during periods of stress and others making the case that this money can be even stickier than conventional deposits.""There has been a significant increase in broker deposits in the banking system over the past year,"" FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg told reporters earlier this month, ""and they can present liquidity risk.""Regulators can limit or prohibit a bank from taking in brokered deposits if they determine the funding isn't being adequately managed.Story continuesFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Martin Gruenberg has said brokered deposits can present a 'liquidity risk.' REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein (Evelyn Hockstein / reuters)But FDIC vice chair Travis Hill said Thursday in a speech that these deposits can also be ""extremely sticky"" since the customers are fully insured, have no relationship with the bank, and thus ""are indifferent to whether the bank has a future or not.""""Far from being ‘hot money,’ these deposits are so cold they are virtually frozen in place,"" he said.'It was opportunistic'During the early part of the pandemic, when interest rates were historically low, banks became awash in deposits. For the two years beginning in March 2020, total deposits in the banking system swelled by 34% to $18 trillion.But that reversed when the Fed began moving those rates higher to cool the economy, and customers began seeking out higher yields being offered by money market funds. The first year-over-year deposit decline for all banks came at the beginning of the second quarter of 2022.Read more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cardsThese declines accelerated during the chaos of the spring when Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic failed due to deposit runs and customers pulled money from other regional institutions.Smaller banks have been able to get much of their money back due in part to the ""hot money."" As of Sept. 6, banks outside the industry’s top 25 collectively had their highest level of deposits since mid-March, according to Federal Reserve data.One regional lender that became more reliant on hot money to get through this period was Western Alliance (WAL) in Phoenix. Its brokered deposits went to 35% of all deposits in the second quarter, up from 6.5% a year ago.Another was Zions (ZION), based in Salt Lake City. Its brokered deposits rose by 11% during the second quarter. It had zero brokered deposits during the year-earlier period.""It was opportunistic in the wake of what's happened"" at Silicon Valley Bank, Zions Bank CEO Harris Simmons said at a banking conference earlier this month. He predicted ""that will come down to a much lower number.""Zions headquarters in Salt Lake City. (JHVEPhoto via Getty Images)At regional lenders M&amp;T Bank (MTB) and KeyCorp (KEY), concentrations each rose by more than 5 percentage points while at Dallas-based Comerica (CMA) brokered deposits rose by 7 percentage points.Executives for each of those banks acknowledged last week the funding source helped them regain deposits. Finance chiefs for M&amp;T and KeyCorp both said they plan to replace brokered deposits with regular deposits.Comerica CEO James Herzog also said at a banking conference that the bank is not planning to add any more.""We are paying for those deposits at competitive rates,"" Herzog said. ""That's actually something we are happy to pay because we are having such success of bringing back deposits and overall feel really good about the trends.""A Comerica branch building in California.

Among the country's four largest banks, Wells Fargo's (WFC) concentration rose from near zero to 6.39%. Citigroup (C) maintains the highest concentration of brokered deposits among the big four, at 9.54%.Higher concentrations can be problematic, Alexander Yokum, a regional bank analyst for CFRA, told Yahoo Finance. ""It’s symbolic that a bank's core operations aren't enough and it’s just less profitable.""Banks with higher concentrations of brokered deposits are certainly ""more sensitive to interest rate moves,"" Feddie Strickland, a bank analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, told Yahoo Finance, but in moderation ""they aren’t a bad thing.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

WTI earlier hit an intraday high of $91.31, after Tuesday’s 10-month high of $93.74. For the week, the U.S. crude benchmark was down 0.6%, after a cumulative gain of almost 14% over three weeks.London-traded Brent settled at $93.27 a barrel up, down 3 cents, or 0.03%. Brent rose to as high as $94.64 earlier on the day, after Tuesday’s 10-month high of $95.96. The global oil benchmark was down 0.7% on the week, after a cumulative gain of nearly 11% over three weeks.The dollar strengthened after the Fed projected another quarter-percentage point rate increase by the year-end, despite leaving rates unchanged for September itself at a policy meeting on Wednesday.“We are prepared to raise rates further, if appropriate,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told a news conference. ""The fact that we decided to maintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn't mean we have decided that we have or have not at this time reached that stance of monetary policy that we are seeking.""Energy-driven inflation one of the Fed's concernsPowell said energy-driven inflation, led by the 30% rally in oil prices since June, was one of the Fed’s bigger concerns.The Fed had raised interest rates 11 times between February 2022 and July 2023, adding a total of 5.25 percentage points to a prior base rate of just 0.25%.Economists fear that the Fed’s renewed hawkish stance will dampen global growth though many also agree that a lid has to be put on oil prices if the Fed is to achieve its annual inflation target of 2%.Story continuesRussia said on Friday it has implemented an immediate 'temporary' suspension of gasoline and diesel exports to all countries except for four former Soviet states and its own overseas military bases, with the goal of stabilizing its domestic market.Kremlin fuel export ban will further tighten oil marketRussia's Transneft then suspended deliveries of diesel to the key Baltic and Black Sea (NYSE:SE) terminals of Primorsk and Novorossiysk on Friday, state media agency Tass said.The Kremlin said the ban was “temporary” and designed to address rising energy prices in Russia. Russian wholesale gasoline prices were down nearly 10% and diesel down 7.5% on Friday after the ban.The ban will ""bring new uncertainty into an already tight global refined product supply picture and the prospect that the impacted countries will be seeking to bid up cargoes from alternative suppliers,"" RBC said in a note.Diesel is the workhorse fuel of the global economy, playing a crucial role in freight, shipping and aviation. Derivatives of diesel such as heating oil are particularly susceptible to winter price surges. Germany and the north-east of the U.S. are both heavily reliant on the fuel for heating homes.Russia is the world’s second-largest seaborne exporter of diesel after the U.S., according to Kpler, a freight data analytics company, and before its invasion of Ukraine was the single biggest diesel exporter to the EU. The EU and U.S. have largely banned imports of Russian refined fuel since February, forcing Moscow to reroute its sales to Turkey and countries in North Africa and Latin America.Russian refined fuel sales, particularly diesel, remain a critical part of oil supplies. In August Russia exported more than 30mn barrels of diesel and gas-oil — a diesel proxy — by sea, according to oil cargo tracker Kpler.(Peter Nurse and Ambar Warrick contributed to this item)Related ArticlesOil ends with 1st weekly loss in 4; Russia fuel exports ban limits downside Gold ends week little changed, clinging to mid $1,900, despite hawkish FedJPMorgan forecasts energy ""supercycle"" with Brent crude potentially hitting $150 per barrel]"

The sectors affected by this significant divestment include mining, metals, oil and gas, power, telecom, and construction materials.The metals and mining sector experienced a notable sell-off as FPIs sold shares worth Rs 4,556 crore in the first half of September. This came after they offloaded shares valued at Rs 7,000 crore in August. Another sector witnessing a similar trend is power, with FPIs selling shares worth Rs 4,153 crore, after an allocation of Rs 11,563 crore in August.Additional sectors where FPIs reduced their holdings include services (Rs 3,706 crore), oil and gas (Rs 2,687 crore), and telecom (Rs 1,204 crore).Despite this extensive sell-off across various sectors, the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector saw renewed interest. FPIs invested Rs 6,400 crore in the BFSI sector after a similar amount was sold in August. This infusion led to a nearly 1.5% gain for the Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial indices over the past month.Capital goods stocks continued to attract FPI attention for the eighth month in a row with investments totaling Rs 3,569 crore in the first half of September. This consistent interest is backed by a significant growth in order books for capital goods companies. The backlog of orders for the top 30 engineering and construction firms surged by 12% to $161 billion in the June quarter. This surge was largely driven by substantial orders from railway and road construction sectors.In addition to the BFSI and capital goods sectors, information technology (IT) companies also witnessed a shift in FPI sentiment. FPIs invested Rs 1,438 crore in IT shares during the first half of September, following an investment of Rs 4,088 crore in August.

WTI earlier hit an intraday high of $90.98. The U.S. crude benchmark fell almost 1% on Wednesday, after reaching a 10-month high of $92.43 in the prior session.WTI has to re-enter $90 territory to avoid being pushed to mid-$80 levels, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“WTI’s charts are showing that unless the $91 or $92 levels are reclaimed, a test of the Daily Middle Bollinger Band could take WTI to $86.75,” said Dixit. “Beyond that, a test of the 100-Week SMA, or Simple Moving Average, of $86 is very likely.”London-traded Brent crude settled at $93.30 a barrel, down 23 cents, 0.3%. Like WTI, Brent also fell 1% on Wednesday. The global crude benchmark hit a 10-month high of $95.96 the day before.Russia export ban suggests further squeeze in already tight marketOil prices saw a volatile session on Wednesday after Russia temporarily banned exports of gasoline and diesel to all countries outside a circle of four ex-Soviet states with immediate effect in order to stabilize the domestic fuel market, the government said on Thursday.The shortfall will force Russia's fuel buyers to shop elsewhere, prompting refiners to process more of a dwindling crude supply to meet that demand, said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM.“Crude prices were ready to continue pulling back but Russia’s abrupt decision to impose a full ban on gasoline and diesel exports sent oil higher,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform. “Russia is trying to stabilize the domestic situation, which means only ex-Soviet states will have access to their exports.”Story continuesCrude prices have been on a tear since early June, with the rally accelerating in the past three weeks after major oil exporters Saudi Arabia and Russia colluded to remove a combined 1.3 million barrels from the market each day until the end of the year.But while the Saudi-Russian cuts and other production reductions would remove a total of about 3.0 million barrels from supply — or about 3% of daily requirement — some who follow the trade warn that inflationary pressure brought on by oil’s 30% rally over just three months could do the market in.Europe’s woes, dollar rally are bigger for global markets now “The oil market just finished pricing in the extension of a 300,000 bpd oil export cut, and now faces uncertainty as to how long this temporary ban will last,” said Moya, the analyst at OANDA. “A stronger dollar is limiting today’s oil price rally as it comes along with a deteriorating outlook for Europe.”The euro and other currencies on the bloc came under fresh stress Thursday from a potential end to central bank rate hikes in the region amid a weakening economic outlook. The dollar surged instead to a six-month high, limiting buying of dollar-denominated commodities by holders of other currencies.The dollar strengthened after the Fed projected another quarter-percentage point rate increase by the year-end, despite leaving rates unchanged for September itself at a policy meeting on Wednesday.“We are prepared to raise rates further, if appropriate,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told a news conference. ""The fact that we decided to maintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn't mean we have decided that we have or have not at this time reached that stance of monetary policy that we are seeking.""Powell said energy-driven inflation, led by the 30% rally in oil prices since June, was one of the Fed’s bigger concerns.The Fed had raised interest rates 11 times between February 2022 and July 2023, adding a total of 5.25 percentage points to a prior base rate of just 0.25%.Economists fear that the Fed’s renewed hawkish stance will dampen global growth though many also agree that a lid has to be put on oil prices if the Fed is to achieve its annual inflation target of 2%.(Peter Nurse and Ambar Warrick contributed to this item)Related ArticlesOil ends down after swinging on Russia fuel ban, U.S. crude stays below $90 European Energy Crisis Prompts High-Level ConferenceGold at week-low as Fed on hawkish overdrive; more downside seen]"

According to reports, meetings on Wednesday were attended by Disney CEO Bob Iger, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos, and Comcast Chairman Donna Langley. Both sides are expected to meet again today to continue those discussions with sources telling CNBC's David Faber that the talks may be nearing the end now. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita to give us some more details here. Hey, Akiko.AKIKO FUJITA: Hey there, Brad. Well, you talked about those four CEOs being in the room yesterday. They are expected to be back at the table today. That is certainly critical and points to potential movements on the front in terms of negotiations partly because that hasn't happened until now.As you noted, CNBC now reporting that a deal is close and could potentially be finalized by the end of the day today. The two sides, though, releasing a rare joint statement late Wednesday saying the WGA and AMPTP met for bargaining today and will meet again tomorrow. Now, the key issues on the table still remain the same.We're talking about writers specifically seeking residuals that would be tied to the number of views their episodes get on a streaming service as opposed to the number of episodes. They're also seeking a mandatory minimum level for the number of writers that are in the room in TV. Of course, protection from content related to artificial intelligence certainly on the table as well.Story continuesNow, there are still a part on these issue. But there's been a sense over the last several weeks that these two sides, at least the divide is starting to narrow. For example, the studios have agreed to guarantee that writers will not lose out on credit or pay if they use artificial intelligence to help write their scripts.The studios have also proposed to allow showrunners to hire at least two writers per show, still different from what the WGA is asking for, but shows some movement there. And the studios have not budged on the issue of residuals, but they have agreed to at least share some viewership data with the union.Now, we're talking about potential movement here in negotiations because there is a renewed sense of urgency between these two sides largely because October has for a while been seen as kind of an artificial deadline on the table. For one, the studios look at more than 140 days into this strike. This is kind of the time they have seen that writers have started to really feel the financial pain. They believe they have some leverage on that front.For the writers, at least behind the scenes, there has been pressure building on the WGA to come to an agreement by October. So this year is not awash. And the fear is that if this goes past October that this could be done in terms of content for the year. So we'll be watching any developments coming out of LA today.

(NYSE:PRU) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Prudential Financial The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Prudential FinancialOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP and Head of International Businesses &amp; PGIM, Andrew Sullivan, for US$1.2m worth of shares, at about US$101 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$96.97. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In the last year Prudential Financial insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of Prudential FinancialI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 0.2% of Prudential Financial shares, worth about US$62m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Prudential Financial Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Prudential Financial shares in the last quarter. Our analysis of Prudential Financial insider transactions leaves us cautious. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Prudential Financial.

Indeed, tech's hot 2023 relief run may be running out of steam. Not even generative artificial intelligence (AI) tech seems impressive enough to reverse this latest market pullback. These days, it's all about high-interest rates. It certainly is quite possible that many market participants underestimated just how hawkish the Federal Reserve can be. With more rate hikes up ahead, tech investors need to return to the drawing board to contemplate whether now is a good time to take some profits and run before the pull of rates has a chance to return.The Impact on Generative AI and Tech StocksWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with INTC. Click here to check it out. INTC 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of INTCOf course, generative AI is still a big deal. However, the relative overvaluation in some of the names within the semiconductor space may very well be what drags the broader Nasdaq back into correction territory. In this piece, we'll look at two impressive tech stocks that have been pulled down by rates in recent weeks. Although the long-term share price trajectory of both firms could not be more different, I still view deep undervaluation to be had in both names as the painful market dip takes its next step. Whether or not stocks finish the third quarter higher or lower from current levels, the following plays, I believe, make for fantastic contrarian plays for value investors who are in it for at least the next five years.Currently, database kingpin Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) and former semiconductor king Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) look like terrific value options for those who are brave enough to jump in after the market's recent spill.Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL)Shares of Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) ended Thursday lower by just over 3%, mostly due to negativity facing the broader tech sector. The stock is now down more than 13% from its all-time high hit back in June and could be destined for lower levels as the upbeat AI play looks to take a dive.Story continuesUndoubtedly, not too many investors saw the impressive upside surge of 2022-23 coming. Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) is an older tech company that seemed to have lost its way prior to the glorious bounce at the hands of the AI boom. In any case, the recent pullback in Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) shouldn't have come as a surprise after shares nearly doubled in around a year's time. The real question now is how far does the AI stock have to fall before it's time to get back in.Oracle's Value and Future ProspectsOf course, it's impossible to tell when Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) will bottom out. However, after its recent correction, I do view plenty of value to be had currently, even as negative market momentum accelerates from here.At the time of writing, shares of ORCL trade at a modest 32.47 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E). That's not all too high for a $300 billion tech titan with impressive AI capabilities. Of course, the company's latest quarterly earnings results failed to impress. First-quarter revenue came in on the lighter side at $12.5 billion, down from the $13.8 billion it posted in the quarter prior. Earnings per share (EPS) numbers came in at $1.19, topping the analyst consensus of $1.15. Still, such a modest beat isn't enough to cut it these days, especially for the stocks bid up due to the rise of the AI trend.Earlier this month, Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) was downgraded by Morgan Stanley from overweight to neutral over concerns that growth has peaked. While management is bullish on generative AI, it's unclear as to whether it'll be enough to jolt growth rates as other pressures weigh.My takeaway? Short-term pain could be ahead. But brave investors should be looking out for a longer-term gain.Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC)Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) is another old-school tech company that could become more relevant in the AI age. The stock has already endured a painful drop of more than 63% to multi-year lows. So far in 2023, it's been mostly positive as the stock has steadily climbed back, now up 29.6% year to date. Indeed, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) stock was oversold, but if it's to keep the good times going strong in the face of economic headwinds, the firm needs to go big on AI.Intel's Position in the AI RaceAn analyst over at Melius Research recently remarked on the company's position in the AI race. Though it's a latecomer, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) cannot be counted out. Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger recently remarked on AI, noting that its AI chip named Gaudi remains a ""strong, open alternative in the AI market."" Undoubtedly, AI advancements could be key to Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) stock's multi-year reversal. For now, many investors aren't so convinced that Gaudi can give other AI chips a good run for their money.Regardless, I believe Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC)'s muted AI ambitions could pave the way for big gains moving forward.

This reassertion comes despite recent quarterly results that left some investors disappointed. Oracle's Executive Vice President, Doug Kehring, restated these projections at the company's annual financial analysts' conference on Thursday. He expressed confidence in reaching the stated revenue goal, maintaining a 45% operating margin by fiscal 2026, and achieving an over 10% annual increase in earnings per share.The company's strategic focus remains on expanding its cloud-computing rental business, an area where it has historically lagged behind competitors like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)., and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google. However, investor optimism has been growing as Oracle's cloud services are believed to have the potential to grow rapidly and meet the high-demand computing needs of artificial intelligence products.Kehring emphasized that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business, which generated $5 billion in revenue in the fiscal year ending May 2023, is targeting Google. However, this revenue represented only about 10% of Oracle's total income.Investor enthusiasm was dampened last week when Oracle reported a 30% increase in cloud sales for the quarter, compared to a 54% surge in the previous period. This announcement led to a nearly 14% drop in Oracle's shares, marking the largest single-day decline in over two decades and pulling them down from an all-time peak.Ahead of Thursday's event, many analysts anticipated that Oracle would maintain its outlook. To reach its target, the company needs to sustain an average annual sales growth rate of approximately 9% over the next three fiscal years.However, given the recent slowdown in Oracle's electronic health records division Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN), which it acquired last year, and the ongoing shift to cloud services, some analysts, including Bloomberg Intelligence's Anurag Rana, believe this to be a challenging endeavor.Story continuesOn Thursday, Oracle's shares fell by 2.8% to $109.65 at 3:13 p.m. in New York.

Around 95% of these were operated by franchisees as of Dec. 31, making up nearly 30% of the company's total revenue in 2022.Average cash flows for these U.S. franchisees have grown more than 35% over the past five years, the letter showed.The company will also change the term for payments from ""service fees"" to ""royalty fees"", used by all other McDonald's markets around the world.Royalty is a fee paid by restaurant operators to the owner and the rate is set based on the revenue generated by the licensed property.(Reporting by Savyata Mishra and Ananya Mariam Rajesh; additonal reporting by Granth Vanaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)]"

And it's been very strategic.We talked with the CMO, Tarek Hassan, in Cannes Lion Film Festival-- or Festival of Creativity, I should say-- just about all of these different campaigns, whether it's been annexed to some high profile celebrity, or whether it's involved a purple taste bud by the name of Grimace, or whether that's making sure that they've just got a good flashy food item that's going to drive even more traffic, like a spicy chicken nugget. Move over, chicken sandwich wars. The chicken nuggets wars are back and hotter than ever, apparently, with this new spicy nugget.SEANA SMITH: They always are.

The company's current ROCE stands at an impressive 24%, significantly outpacing the average of 8.2% earned by companies in a similar industry.ROCE is a key metric that measures the pre-tax profit a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. For Copa Holdings, this was calculated as US$751m ÷ (US$5.1b - US$2.0b) based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023. This robust return indicates that the company is effectively reinvesting its profits at increasing rates of return.Despite this positive trend, there has been a noticeable increase in the company's current liabilities over the same period. The ratio of current liabilities to total assets has reached approximately 39%. While this does not immediately pose a threat, it's worth noting that such an increase could introduce new risks for the business in the future.Meanwhile, McDonald's (NYSE:NYSE:MCD) and Orion (NYSE:OEC) have also shown attractive ROCE trends recently. McDonald's has maintained a steady ROCE of 24% over the last five years while increasing its capital employed by 57%. Similarly, Orion has consistently earned an ROCE of 17% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 51% in that time.However, despite Orion's favorable fundamentals, its stock has fallen 28% over the last five years, possibly presenting an opportunity for investors. On the other hand, McDonald's stock has risen strongly over the same period, suggesting that market expectations align with the company's strong fundamentals.These trends suggest that companies with growing ROCE and expanding capital employed could be potential multi-baggers, offering attractive opportunities for investors.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) looks attractive right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for McDonald's:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.24 = US$11b ÷ (US$50b - US$3.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, McDonald's has an ROCE of 24%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Hospitality industry average of 9.6%. See our latest analysis for McDonald's roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for McDonald's compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for McDonald's.So How Is McDonald's' ROCE Trending?We'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like McDonald's. The company has employed 57% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 24%. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models.Our Take On McDonald's' ROCEIn short, we'd argue McDonald's has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.Story continuesIf you'd like to know about the risks facing McDonald's, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should be aware of.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

With a strategic capital business segment managing around $60 billion of third-party assets under management (AUM), Prologis operates as a real estate investment trust across four global divisions: Americas, Europe, Asia, and other Americas. With a current price of $114.55 per share and a GF Value of $149.84, Prologis appears to be modestly undervalued.Prologis (PLD): A Hidden Gem or a Mirage? Unveiling Its True Market ValueUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the intrinsic value of a stock. It's calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides a visual representation of the stock's fair trading value. If the stock price significantly deviates from the GF Value Line, it indicates potential overvaluation or undervaluation, thus influencing future returns.Prologis's stock, currently priced at $114.55 per share, appears to be modestly undervalued based on the GF Value. This suggests that its long-term return is likely to be higher than its business growth.Prologis (PLD): A Hidden Gem or a Mirage? Unveiling Its True Market ValueLink: These companies may deliever higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could lead to permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before investing. Prologis has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.02, ranking lower than 76.45% of 726 companies in the REITs industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Prologis's financial strength as 5 out of 10, indicating a fair balance sheet.Story continuesPrologis (PLD): A Hidden Gem or a Mirage? Unveiling Its True Market ValueProfitability and GrowthCompanies that have been consistently profitable offer less risk to investors. Prologis, with consistent profitability over the past 10 years and a revenue of $7.70 billion in the past twelve months, boasts an operating margin of 41.69%. This ranks lower than 63.7% of 686 companies in the REITs industry. However, the overall profitability of Prologis is ranked 8 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is a critical factor in company valuation. Prologis has an average annual revenue growth of 13.1%, ranking better than 87.99% of 633 companies in the REITs industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 14.2%, ranking better than 77.34% of 534 companies in the REITs industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) can help determine its profitability. The ROIC measures how effectively a company generates cash flow relative to its invested capital. The WACC is the average rate a company is expected to pay its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it suggests the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Prologis's ROIC is 3.97, and its WACC is 9.36.ConclusionIn summary, Prologis appears to be modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks better than 77.34% of 534 companies in the REITs industry.

I think that’s going to become a much more open network not just for our customers, but for the third parties that visit these locations.”“One of the key requests that we hear from our customers is an ability to reduce charging times, and that requires both improvement of vehicle technology as well as charging technology. It also means that there are not only going to be more nodes, but the power needs of those nodes are going to become higher. So the opportunity for utilities and power providers to keep up with that demand is going to be quite significant.”“[Charging infrastructure is] an engineering, a planning, a permitting and development problem. It’s not a fundamental science problem. What we really need to see in this space, to get to a higher degree of benefit [from EVs], is to see vehicle costs come down and battery technology needs to improve. That’s fundamental science. … I have no doubt we’re going to get to cost parity even in the heavy-duty space in the near term. But on the infrastructure side, it is very much an engineering problem, and being an electrical engineer, that’s something that we can work with.”Articles by Grace SharkeyRead moreReal estate investors surge into electric truck chargingTerminal Industries departs stealth mode with $17M for AI yard operationsACT Research bullish on adoption of alternative zero-emission trucksThe post Prologis looks to lead on commercial EV charging infrastructure appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

With the travel industry slowly regaining its footing after the turbulence of the past couple of years, discerning investors are eyeing opportunities in the market. In this article, we’ll delve into the realm of travel stocks. We focus on uncovering promising options for those looking to make savvy investments. You can expect more of the same here.The appeal of travel stocks, particularly undervalued ones, lies in their potential for robust growth as the world gradually reopens. The pandemic-induced slump hit the sector hard, leaving some gems undervalued and overlooked. These underrated travel stocks offer a unique chance to enter the market at a favorable price point.Amidst the plethora of options, investors should focus on travel stocks showing strong fundamentals, a resilient business model and adaptability to the evolving travel landscape. These qualities will serve as a solid foundation for potential long-term gains. Let’s explore some of these hidden gems in the travel industry and the factors that make them stand out.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInvestors scouting for opportunities in the travel sector will find these stocks enticing, backed by positive industry connotations and the promise of future growth.Southwest Airlines (LUV)Southwest airplaneSouthwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) is traversing a turbulent year, with its stock showing a year-to-date return of -11.23%. The topsy-turvy nature of its sojourn this year mirrors the quality of its recent financials.In the second quarter of 2023, Southwest Airlines kicked things up a notch with a 4.59% surge in revenue, reaching an impressive $7.04 billion. However, they encountered turbulence as net income experienced a 10.13% dip, settling at $683 million. Ouch! Furthermore, operating income took a significant nosedive, plummeting by 31.35% to $795 million.Story continuesRegarding earnings per share, Southwest Airlines slightly botched the landing at $1.08, just below expectations. On a brighter note, revenue slightly exceeded expectations.These results reflect the challenges Southwest Airlines faces, like many in the travel industry, due to rising fuel costs and other disruptions.Against this backdrop, it’s important to consider the broader travel industry landscape. Travel stocks, including airlines, have faced uncertainties such as labor disputes and fuel cost pressures. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has taken a cautious stance on airline stocks in light of these challenges. However, Southwest Airlines’ recent tentative agreement with Transport Workers Union Local 555 is positive for labor relations within the company.While short-term caution is advised, long-term investors looking for undervalued travel stocks may find Southwest Airlines intriguing. It continues to navigate these headwinds and position itself on a bright note for the future.In summary, Southwest Airlines presents a mixed picture. On the one hand, it is certainly facing headwinds. However, it is worth considering as a long-term pick as it works through these industry-wide issues.Walt Disney (DIS)Source: ShutterstockWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) has been on a rollercoaster ride in the past six months, with its stock experiencing a 10% slump. However, with a dazzling display of financial resilience amidst turbulent market waters, the media juggernaut Disney unveiled its latest earnings report, replete with riveting revelations. Despite a battlefield of adversity, Disney defied the odds, boasting a splendid 3.84% year-over-year (YoY) surge in revenue, an astounding $22.33 billion spectacle! However, not every scene in this financial epic was filled with triumph. Alas, the company’s net income unveiled a dramatic twist, plunging to a staggering -$460 million, marking a harrowing plummet of 132.65%.The diluted earnings per share also mirrored this decline, standing at -$0.25, down by 132.47%. These figures translate to a net profit margin of -2.06%, showing a decrease of 131.45%. On a more positive note, Disney’s net change in cash surged by $1.06 billion, a remarkable 437.58% improvement.In light of these financials, Disney surpassed analysts’ expectations, beating EPS estimates by an impressive 6.1%. The reported EPS of $1.03 outshone the expected $0.97. However, the company fell slightly short on revenue, with reported figures of $22.33 billion compared to the expected $22.53 billion, resulting in a minor surprise of -0.89%. These recent developments come amidst rumors of potential changes within Disney. These include discussions about selling ABC networks and a recent Disney/Charter deal. A potential agreement could significantly impact Disney+, ESPN, and the broader pay-TV landscape.As investors ponder the future of this iconic entertainment giant, it’s clear that Disney faces both challenges and opportunities. Travel stocks have their own unique dynamics to consider, making Disney an intriguing option in the broader context of undervalued travel stocks. While Disney’s recent financials show a mix of positive and negative signals, it will be fascinating to see how the company navigates these waters and adapts to the ever-changing media and travel industry landscapes.Tripadvisor (TRIP)image of mobile phone screen displaying tripadvisor logo (TRIP)Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.comTripadvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) has navigated a challenging year, with year-to-date returns showing approximately 13.9% decline. However, keen investors are finding reasons to consider this travel stock, and here’s why. In June 2023, Tripadvisor reported revenues of $494 million, reflecting an impressive YoY growth of 18%. While net income did experience a dip of 23% to $24 million, the company maintained a steady net profit margin of 4.86%, indicating resilience despite industry headwinds. Operating income decreased by 30.2%, landing at $44 million.One noteworthy aspect is Tripadvisor’s commitment to enhancing its experiences and dining segment, which could be a growth catalyst in the travel industry. There is anticipation of potential collaboration amid recent discussions between Tripadvisor’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Matt Goldberg and Google/Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)/(NASDAQ:GOOGL). This partnership, if realized, could open new doors for Tripadvisor. However, investors should consider rising costs as the company pursues its growth strategies. The recent earnings report revealed a miss in diluted EPS (-8.1%) and a revenue beat (+4.3%). However, Tripadvisor’s potential as an undervalued travel stock for 2023 is worth considering, especially for those seeking unique opportunities in the sector.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Meanwhile, the United Auto Workers (UAW) are on the sixth day of their strike against the Big Three automakers: Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA). Earlier this summer, United Parcel Service (UPS) and the Teamsters union were able to reach an agreement and avoid a prolonged strike. Yahoo Finance spoke to experts across the industry to discuss the summer of strikes and the potential impact on the economy.Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman broke down the recent rise in work stoppages. Newman was not concerned about the economic impact. He said, ""Economists are now saying, how much damage is this actually going to cause to the broader U.S. economy? And the answer is hardly any.""Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations Senior Economic Advisor Erica Groshen discussed the UAW strike and what it could mean for labor conditions. Groshen said, ""We certainly have a very strong labor market, a very strong economy, and strike activity usually rises when the economy and the labor market is strong.""Axios Business Reporter Nathan Bomey revealed his concerns over EV production amid the rise in strikes across the country. Bomey stated, ""I think their long-term concern for the automakers is that they come out of this with higher labor costs which makes it more difficult to make EVs at a price point which people can afford.""U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Neil Bradley broke down what he referred to as ""the summer of strikes."" Bradley said, ""You have these unrealistic, almost excessive demands on the part of union leadership across a whole host of industry that could ultimately be destabilizing for the entire economy.""Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden discussed the effect of the Hollywood strikes on major studios like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN).

Weprin said, ""In the short term, they're going to have all this extra cash ... but in the long term they do need new scripted TV shows and movies in order to conduct their daily business.MNTN CEO Mark Douglas broke down the major issues between writers and Hollywood studios, including streaming and AI. Douglas explained, ""I think these studios need to meet consumers where they are, bring the content, consumers will bring the dollars, and we can go forward with everyone entertained.""David Madland, Center for American Progress Senior Fellow and Senior Adviser at the American Worker Project, discussed the resurgence behind strikes and labor unions, as well as the impact on the U.S. economy. Madland said, ""In the short run, a strike is not good for anyone, the workers, the writers lose clearly for a long period of time that they don't get an income.""Art Wheaton, Director of Labor Relations at Cornell University ILR School, explained the motivating factors behind the recent workers strikes. Wheaton said, ""Everybody is looking at the bargaining table as a way to make up for all of the costs and the increased cost of living."" Wheaton added, ""Currently we have a more union-friendly President and that means the labor law tends to be a little more friendly toward the NLRB (National Labor Relations Board).""Video highlights:00:00:03 - Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman00:00:27 - Erica Groshen, Cornell University00:00:40 - Axios Business Reporter Nathan Bomey00:00:58 - U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Neil Bradley00:01:15 - Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden00:01:31 - The Hollywood Reporter Media &amp; Business Writer Alex Weprin00:01:49 - MNTN CEO Mark Douglas00:02:03 - American Worker Project Senior Adviser David Madland00:02:21 - Art Wheaton, Cornell University ILR School]"

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with LRCX. Click here to check it out. UPS 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of UPSAs of 2023-09-21, United Parcel Service Inc(NYSE:UPS)'s intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $277.35. It's currently trading at a price of $155.745. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 43.85%. The company is significantly undervalued.Unlocking Intrinsic Value: A Deep Dive into United Parcel Service IncThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. United Parcel Service Inc(NYSE:UPS)'s intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$11.53GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.47%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 16.10% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=148.85Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=128.5Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=277.35Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $223.75. This valuation indicates that the United Parcel Service Inc(NYSE:UPS) is significantly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 30.39%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

It’s one of the earlier reports we’ll count in our Q3 tally, with others such as Auto Zone and General Mills also reporting in recent days.FedEx exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 23% and posted year-over-year growth of more than 30%, with lower operating expenses helping drive the improvement. Quarterly revenue totaled $21.7 billion, a tick below expectations and slipping 6% from the year-ago period. Operating income climbed 25% from the year-ago period, with cost reductions and other key initiatives providing meaningful tailwinds. Still, it’s worth noting that the company has touched on ongoing demand weakness, which negatively impacted the quarter’s results.The company’s DRIVE program has also been delivering benefits and is expected to continue; FedEx expects permanent cost reductions of $1.8 billion from the transformative program, again helping offset recent demand weakness and deliver improved profitability.The market reacted highly favorably to the print, with FDX shares seeing notable buying pressure following the release. A peer, United Parcel Service UPS, also saw modest buying pressure in response to the results.Given the better-than-expected print, it raises a valid question – which company, FedEx or United Parcel Service, currently looks like a better buy? Let’s take a closer look at a few characteristics of each. FedEx vs. United Parcel ServiceUPS, a current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), has seen its near-term earnings outlook shift negatively across all timeframes, with analysts in full agreement. On the contrary, FedEx is a current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), with positive revisions hitting the tape for its current and next fiscal years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd when it comes to growth, FedEx is the clear winner – FDX’s earnings are forecasted to climb 16% in its current year (FY24) and an additional 22% in FY25, whereas United Parcel Service’s earnings are forecasted to take a 27% hit in its current year before returning back to growth in FY24.Story continuesRegarding valuation, FDX’s current 14.4X forward earnings multiple is beneath UPS’ current 16.7X, with both values residing below their respective five-year medians. FDX sports a Style Score of “A” for Value, whereas UPS carries a “B.”Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFedEx has also been more consistent with its quarterly results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by an average of 17% across its last four releases compared to UPS’ 2%.As shown below, better-than-expected quarterly results have driven FDX's outperformance in 2023, regularly boosting shares post-earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineFedEx posted results that impressed the market, with shares gaining roughly 5% following the release. Lowered costs, thanks to successful transformative initiatives, drove the better-than-expected results, with the company’s profitability improving nicely.And when pitting FedEx FDX against its peer, United Parcel Service UPS, it appears that FDX shares appear to be the better option. UPS has seen its earnings outlook shift negatively over the recent months, hasn’t seen positive reactions to quarterly results, and is expected to witness a growth slowdown in its current year.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Upon announcing results, FedEx shares rose 5.7% to $264.60 in extended trading.Fiscal First Quarter HighlightsFor the quarter that ended on August 31st, FedEx reported that revenue dropped to $21.7 billion as it began the previous fiscal year with quarterly revenue of $23.2 billion. Yet, FedEx made a net income of $1.08 billion, or $4.23 a share which is a 32% YoY improvement from last year’s comparable quarter when it made $875 million, or $3.33 a share. When making adjustments for “business optimization” costs, adjusted earnings end up amounting to $4.55 a share.The FedEx unit which delivers packages from retailers like Walmart (NYSE: WMT) experienced a 59% rise in its operating income.The Ground unit that ships packages in the U.S. and Canada picked up about 400,000 additional packages per day as UPS customers shifted to alternate carriers ahead of August 1st which was the expiration date of the contract with the unionized workforce. The UPS union ended up approving a new labor contract on August 22nd, ending the strike threat. But while tensions lasted, FedEx's business benefited.FedEx Freight who provides less-than-truckload LTL freight took advantage of the bankruptcy of Yellow as it added 5,000 average daily shipments, but its operating income still dropped 26%.FedEx's air-based Express business pulled out an 18% operating profit gain for the quarter as it reduced  expenses arising from parking aircraft and layoffs and succeeded to more than offset a 9% revenue decline.Outlook Shaped By Macro HeadwindsBoth FedEx and UPS continue to grapple with deflating demand along with global recession fears. But despite lagging demand, FedEx will be raising its prices as of January 1st for about 5.9% while also introducing demand surcharges for the holiday season.Story continuesAlso on Wednesday, FedEx altered its full-year fiscal 2024 revenue outlook as it now expects flat revenue YoY, while it previously guided for flat to low-single-digit percent revenue growth. It also increased the lower end of its adjusted fiscal earnings guidance that is now expected in the range between $17 and $18.50 per share, reflecting leaner operations and customer gains.Ahead Of The Vital Holiday Shipping SeasonWithout offering a specific forecast for the undergoing quarter and the vital holiday shopping season when volume typically doubles, FedEx only showed that it is well equipped for the task. Well ahead of the holidays, the Memphis-based global delivery company began its fiscal year strong after implementing various cost-cutting measures during its prior fiscal year to address ongoing economic challenges.Offsetting Shaky DemandCost cutting efforts and disruptions of its rivals, including labor tensions at UPS and the bankruptcy filing of Yellow, enabled FedEx to deliver better than expected results amid continued weaker shipping demand. However, gains from UPS tensions are likely to be less durable compared to those from Yellow who is out of business. Under pressure from investors, FedEx will continue its cost cutting efforts, a strategy that also includes consolidating its operating units.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The new agreement is expected to increase labor costs for U.S. hourly workers, potentially disadvantaging these traditional automakers against their competitors.Interestingly, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), known as a nonunion shop, could benefit from these labor negotiations. The electric vehicle pioneer's profitability already exceeds that of Ford and GM and matches Stellantis. However, it's important to note that foreign automakers might be the biggest beneficiaries due to their ability to reset domestic cost standards in light of the ongoing strike.The Detroit-Three automakers had a labor cost advantage during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the previous UAW labor contract. However, they now face challenges similar to those experienced by FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). Both companies have seen significant shifts in their cost structures due to changes in wage policies and union contracts.The automotive market is not shielded from foreign competition like the parcel shipping industry dominated by UPS and FedEx. Therefore, both Tesla and Detroit-Three must consider foreign automakers' strategies. Toyota (NYSE:TM) might emerge as an even bigger winner than Tesla in this protracted labor dispute. Toyota, along with other foreign automakers, operates nonunion plants in the southern US and imports cars from overseas plants.Despite wage gains by UAW, this isn't expected to pose a significant threat to these companies' existence. For instance, General Motors now employs as many salaried scientists as hourly workers. Wage increases are inevitable and could add an additional $1 billion to costs compared to Wall Street's expectations. However, this would only marginally impact the price of North American cars.Story continuesAs negotiations continue, both workers and companies aim to improve their standards of living and maintain competitiveness respectively. The effects of these negotiations have already been felt in the stock market. Ford and GM shares have fallen about 19% and 15% respectively since the end of June when labor issues began to affect investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Toyota's stock has risen by about 16% over the same period.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

In that report, analysts expect American Express to post earnings of $2.98 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 20.65%.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for American Express The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At American ExpressThe insider, Monique Herena, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.6m worth of shares at a price of US$173 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$157. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.All up, insiders sold more shares in American Express than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. American Express insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$161m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At American Express Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded American Express shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the American Express insiders selling.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this credit card issuer and global payments company have returned -1.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, which American Express falls in, has gained 3.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, American Express is expected to post earnings of $2.98 per share, indicating a change of +20.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.13 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +13%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.50 indicates a change of +12.3% from what American Express is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, American Express is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For American Express, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.43 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $60.81 billion and $66.71 billion estimates indicate +15% and +9.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmerican Express reported revenues of $15.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.4%. EPS of $2.89 for the same period compares with $2.57 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.34%. The EPS surprise was +3.21%.Over the last four quarters, American Express surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.American Express is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about American Express. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Martin Marietta Materials Martin Marietta Materials' Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Martin Marietta Materials managed to grow EPS by 16% per year, over three years. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Martin Marietta Materials shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 18% to 22%, and revenue is growing. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Martin Marietta Materials.Story continuesAre Martin Marietta Materials Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$26b company like Martin Marietta Materials. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$158m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.6% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Does Martin Marietta Materials Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Martin Marietta Materials is that it is growing profits. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Martin Marietta Materials   you should know about.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

Indeed, we are aiming to use 100% renewable electricity across Mondelēz International manufacturing sites by 2030. This includes working with governments and suppliers to generate and purchase renewable electricity where we operate.This transition integrated into the electrification roadmap also can deliver reductions on the consumption of fuels.In 2022, approximately 39% of the electricity used in our manufacturing sites was renewable, compared to approximately 32% in 2021.Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan (MENAP) Progress Against End-to-End CO2 e Reduction Goal by 2025 - RenewablesWe signed several agreements across Egypt, Bahrain and Pakistan during 2022 that aim at accelerating the installation of solar. In Pakistan, the hub confectionery plant will become the first MENAP site to commission solar-energy sources. The system is anticipated to be able to contribute to a CO₂e reduction of 79 metric tonnes annually. In Bahrain, we have an agreement to utilize over 4,200 solar panels for both rooftop and carport applications. Once completed, the solar plant is expected to produce 3,820 megawatt-hours of clean energy in the first year of operation, equivalent to reducing carbon emissions by 2,400 metric tonnes, and potentially allowing us to convert 24% of our energy usage into clean energy. In Egypt, we signed an agreement that will seek to convert 11% of the energy in Borg El Arab (BEA) to clean energy.Story continuesRecovering Heat from our Biscuits OvensOur factories in La Haie-Fouassière (France) and East Suzhou (China) implemented heat recovery systems in their biscuits ovens. These initiatives are saving natural gas previously used in the same oven or in other equipment. The reduction in fossil fuel consumption from both initiatives is saving more than 6,000 CO₂e metric tonnes per year.100% Renewable Energy in BrazilThe business unit reduced it's CO₂e footprint while growing in volume.In Brazil, volume increased, so we needed to review our energy strategy to enable sustainable growth. With the focus of contributing 2025 end-to-end carbon reduction goals, the market invested in a new source of energy in order to produce 100% snacks in its factories using renewable energy. This builds upon progress made by the Brazil business unit in 2021.Investing in Renewables Around the WorldIn 2022, two sites in India and all our plants in Argentina moved to securing 100% of their electricity from renewable sources. Several other operations also made important steps in this journey. Our sites in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, for example, are now consuming now consuming between 20% and 33% of their electricity their electricity from renewable sources. In addition, our Montornes factory in Spain installed solar panels on-site. Combined, these initiatives are delivering reductions of more than 25,500 metric tonnes of CO₂e annually.Converting from Fossil Fuels to BiogasOur factory in China East Suzhou partnered with Huan Yan Environment and Towngas to generate biogas out of our food waste. The project is generating more than 5300GJ of biogas from renewable sources every year, turning waste into energy and reducing CO2 e emissions.Reducing Emissions in LogisticsOn our journey to our net zero emissions goal in logistics, we focus our efforts across these key areas:Improving the efficiency of distribution networks by optimizing routes, improving truck and container utilization, adopting intermodal solutions, and reducing traveled distances.Investing in new mobility concepts, including electric and hydrogen trucks.Reducing warehouse emissions at both owned and third-party facilities by converting to renewable energy sources.Over the last months and in partnership with our carriers and third-party logistics suppliers, we have extended our pilots on electric trucks to a variety of markets, including China, Brazil, and India, with promising results and plans to expand and further explore. The pilot programs have been done on short shuttle lanes and outbound transport to customers nearby the distribution centers, with approximately 30-40% reduced CO2 e emissions compared to diesel trucks.Signing a Renewable Power Agreement in PolandWe have signed a virtual power purchase agreement with Golden Peaks Capital for renewable energy in Poland. Some of the new solar plants are starting to generate energy in 2023, while full capacity is expected to be reached in 2024.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.Global stock markets experienced a retreat on September 21 in response to recent central bank decisions, notably from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The Federal Reserve's announcement of an extended period of elevated interest rates dampened market sentiment, leading to declines in stock prices. Concurrently, investors are anxiously awaiting the Bank of England's policy decision, which is uncertain due to softer inflation data. The Stoxx 600 Index witnessed a 0.7% decline in Europe, with nearly all industry sectors in negative territory. In the United States, futures contracts for major benchmarks slipped, extending the previous day's losses on Wall Street. Asian stock markets registered their most significant drop in over a month, reflecting concerns emanating from the Fed's policy stance and global economic uncertainties. Meanwhile, US Treasuries displayed mixed performance in the bond market, with certain yields edging higher. Simultaneously, the US dollar strengthened, often seen as a safe-haven asset during periods of market uncertainty.On the European side, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) ended its five consecutive interest rate hikes, keeping rates unchanged at 1.75% in its latest quarterly monetary policy meeting, reported CNBC. The SNB noted that the previous tightening of monetary policy effectively addressed inflationary pressure. Switzerland's inflation rate of 1.6% in August, below the 2% target, contributed to the decision. Despite Switzerland's strong economic performance and a robust Swiss franc, the central bank maintained its policy stance as the Swiss economy showed signs of stagnation in Q2. The Swiss Market Index was among the few European indices to trade positively following the SNB's decision. Looking ahead, the SNB recognized the global economic outlook remained subdued, with potential risks including a significant global economic slowdown and energy supply concerns in Europe. The central bank anticipates around 1% economic growth in Switzerland this year, with slight unemployment increases and reduced production capacity utilization.Story continuesOil prices declined on September 21, following the largest monthly drop in the previous session. This drop was driven by expectations of a U.S. interest rate hike, which overshadowed the impact of reduced U.S. crude stockpiles. Brent futures for November delivery fell 97 cents, or 1.04%, to $92.56 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) dropped 97 cents, or 1.08%, to $88.69, marking its lowest level since September 14. Both benchmarks had experienced declines of over $1 earlier in the day. The decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged at the recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, while signaling a potential rate increase by year-end, was viewed as a ""hawkish pause"" that added pressure to risk assets like oil, according to ING analysts. This hawkish stance also resulted in the U.S. dollar reaching its highest level since early March, making commodities like oil more expensive for buyers using other currencies. While data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) revealed a decrease in crude inventories in line with expectations, the decline was smaller than anticipated, causing some traders to lock in profits following a 10% gain since the start of the month. Despite these short-term factors, concerns about global supply tightness entering the fourth quarter persisted, with Cushing crude stocks at their lowest since July 2022 and ongoing production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies. In summary, oil prices retreated due to expectations of a U.S. interest rate hike, despite reductions in U.S. crude stockpiles. While short-term factors influenced the market, concerns about supply tightness remained a driving force.On the stock market front, analysts are bullish on tech stock Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) and Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ).

(PCTY), CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) and Q2 Holdings, Inc. (QTWO).A cybersecurity company that operates globally, CyberArk specializes in products and services to protect and safeguard customers’ IT networks and devices. A recent flurry of buyouts by private equity firms has fostered an active rumor mill that’s at times produced rapid gyrations in the prices of cybersecurity stocks. We suspect CyberArk may have been the target of some of this speculation during the third quarter. Moreover, the growing slate of security products offered by cloud-computing giants Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and Google may have bruised investor sentiment toward the group.”07. AutoZone, Inc.

(NYSE:AZO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Below is a chart of Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) P/E ratio plotted against AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO). Any number of examples between large cap tech companies and more mature companies could illustrate this very same point, but we find this specific case most interesting because of its history.Note that in late 2014/early 2015 these multiples crossed one another. The relative harmony between Alphabet and Autozone lasted for just shy of a year at that time, before Alphabet’s shares surged and Autozone’s shares slumped. This relationship need not matter for markets, though we think there is some signal for investors. Autozone today trades at the highest multiples of its recent history, while Alphabet trades at its lowest. Meanwhile, despite growth estimates dropping considerably at Alphabet and appreciating modestly at Autozone, Alphabet will outgrow Autozone by a wide margin over the next five years…” (Click here to read the full text)06.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Textron (TXT). TXT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 13.60. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 19.29. Over the last 12 months, TXT's Forward P/E has been as high as 17.68 and as low as 11.81, with a median of 13.99.TXT is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.16. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. TXT's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.75. Over the last 12 months, TXT's PEG has been as high as 1.40 and as low as 0.98, with a median of 1.15.Another notable valuation metric for TXT is its P/B ratio of 2.13. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 2.93. TXT's P/B has been as high as 2.27 and as low as 1.78, with a median of 2.04, over the past year.Story continuesValue investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. TXT has a P/S ratio of 1.19. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.21.Finally, we should also recognize that TXT has a P/CF ratio of 11.75. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 19.03. TXT's P/CF has been as high as 12.70 and as low as 10.05, with a median of 11.62, all within the past year.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Textron's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that TXT is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

TXT shares soared a solid 4.9% in the last trading session to reach $79.37 on Sep 20, 2023, thereby reflecting investors’ optimism about this stock following its latest order win from the NetJets airline. Textron has clinched a record-breaking deal for delivering up to 1,500 additional Cessna Citation business jets to NetJets over 15 years.Over the course of its history, NetJets has received and added more than 800 private jets from Textron to its fleet. The recent agreement further strengthens Textron’s 40-year long-standing customer relationship with NetJets.The latest order not only extends NetJets’ current fleet agreement but also introduces options for acquiring a growing number of aircraft each year. This facilitates the expansion of its fleet to include the Cessna Citation Ascend, Citation Latitude and Citation Longitude models. This bolsters Textron’s revenue generation prospects.Can Textron Sustain Such Order Demand?TXT’s Textron Aviation unit manufactures, sells and services the Cessna family of business aircraft. The company witnesses a significant order flow for its jets manufactured at Textron Aviation due to their ability to combine reliability, efficiency and comfort with advanced technology and class-leading performance. Textron Aviation’s backlog of $6.8 billion at the end of the second quarter bears testimony to its robust order intake.With that being said, its Cessna Citation family of jets has evolved to offer an unmatched range of capabilities, systems and options that allow customers to expand their business reach. This has resulted in the strong demand for these jets, which currently have six Citation models in production — Citation M2 Gen2, Citation CJ3+, Citation CJ4 Gen2, Citation XLS Gen2, Citation Latitude and Citation Longitude.To further boost its Cessna Citation line of midsize-class jets, Textron is currently developing Citation Ascend. Deliveries are expected to begin in 2025, and NetJets will be the launch customer for the same.Story continuesGiven the high demand, TXT recently announced its plans to add 16,000 square feet to its Interior Manufacturing Facility to effectively meet the accelerating demand for unique and custom Cessna and Beechcraft aircraft interiors. The expansion will allow Textron Aviation to enhance production efficiency across its entire range of Cessna Citation jets, ease the manufacturing process of new models and efficiently meet the latest order it won from NetJets.Growth ProspectsAs businesses are expanding globally, the need for efficient and flexible air travel increases, making private jets an attractive option. Per the report from GlobeNewswire, the global business and private jet market is poised to witness a CAGR of 16.2% over the 2023-2033 period.Such abounding growth prospects tend to benefit Textron as the company boasts a strong portfolio of business jets that offers a seamless progression of aircraft with extraordinary capabilities. Other jet manufacturers that may reap the perks of the expanding private jet market are as follows:Embraer ERJ: Embraer delivers the ultimate experience in business aviation through aircraft that feature disruptive performance, comfort and technology.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4.8% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $80.6 in the previous session. Textron has gained 12.1% since the start of the year compared to the -10.5% move for the Zacks Aerospace sector and the -14.1% return for the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on July 27, 2023, Textron reported EPS of $1.46 versus consensus estimate of $1.2.For the current fiscal year, Textron is expected to post earnings of $5.30 per share on $13.86 billion in revenues. This represents a 32.17% change in EPS on a 7.67% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.66 per share on $14.66 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 6.76% and 5.8%, respectively.Valuation MetricsTextron may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Textron has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 15X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 15.4X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 13.2X versus its peer group's average of 11.8X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.28. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Textron currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Textron passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Textron shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The award has been provided by the Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Philadelphia, PA.Details of the DealValued at $27 million, the contract is expected to be completed by April 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure radomes used on the F/A-18 E/F aircraft.This deal will serve the U.S. Navy and the government of Kuwait. Work related to this deal will be executed in St. Louis, MO.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has several combat proven aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of jet delivery and support orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such strong order flows are expected to boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the world’s largest weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, a prominent jet maker, therefore enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global military aviation market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.4% during 2023-2028. North America constitutes the largest share of the market.Such developments can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities as well as increased defense spending.

The new regional safety training center in East Palestine, Ohio will provide ongoing, free training for first responders from Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and the greater region. This center will further strengthen coordination between railroads and first responders and build upon the company's Operation Awareness and Response (OAR) program, which trains 5,000 first responders annually across its 22-state footprint.From left to right: Ohio State Rep. Monica Robb Blasdel, East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway, Norfolk Southern President and CEO Alan Shaw, East Palestine Fire Chief Keith Drabick, Ohio State Sen.

Shaw. ""First responders are heroes, and we aim to ensure they have the training and expertise to do their jobs safely, no matter the situation. We are grateful to East Palestine's leaders for partnering with us to make this training center a reality.""The new center will attract firefighters and first responders from the region, offering traditional fire service training to all first responders and specialized training for responding to rail and other transportation-related emergencies.Participating at today's groundbreaking were Shaw, East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway, East Palestine Fire Chief Keith Drabick, State Representative Monica Robb Blasdell, and State Senator Mike Rulli, as well as local fire fighters and police officers.""This training center, and our previously expanded Operation Awareness and Response program, will provide first responders across the region with essential training on how to respond to unlikely rail incidents,"" said Norfolk Southern Vice President of Safety John Fleps. ""We're excited to get the training center up and running to bring more capacity for first responder training to all types of incidents, while strengthening the network of professionals specially trained to respond to rail incidents.""Story continuesNorfolk Southern will invest at least $20,000,000 in the new center over the next 10 years. The center will operate through a partnership with the Village of East Palestine, at no cost to the Village or taxpayers. It will establish a lasting presence in the region, promoting top-tier training for years to come. The center is temporarily operating out of Norfolk Southern's rail yard in Bellevue, Ohio, where more than 400 local emergency personnel have received training this year. Preliminary designs for the new facility are currently in development by architecture and engineering firm, Arcadis.Training opportunities at the center will include: classroom, web-based, and online resources, table-top drills, full-scale emergency response exercises, and other specialized training opportunities.Regional traffic to the center, as a result of the investment, will also bring additional customers to area businesses.

380,e3914a97-6d0d-305b-9c16-17696f34454d,NSC,2023-09-22,Biden says Norfolk Southern must be held accountable for Ohio derailment but won't declare disaster,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-says-norfolk-southern-must-170613529.html,1695315973,STORY,['NSC'],"[President Joe Biden ordered federal agencies to continue holding Norfolk Southern accountable for its February derailment in eastern Ohio and appoint a FEMA official to oversee East Palestine's recovery, but he still stopped short of declaring a disaster.Biden issued the executive order Wednesday evening. Part of the order essentially directed the environmental, health and transportation officials to continue doing what they are doing to make sure Norfolk Southern fulfills its responsibilities and report on the progress. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will name a recovery coordinator to monitor the situation.The lack of a disaster declaration has been a key concern for many residents of the area where the derailment happened near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border, but officials have said this situation doesn't easily fit the definition of a disaster because Norfolk Southern is paying to clean up the mess and help the town recover so unpaid bills aren't piling up. The railroad has committed $95 million to the town already as part of a response the railroad expects to cost at least $803 million.Still, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine requested a disaster declaration back in July to make sure any unmet needs would be covered if Norfolk Southern did renege in its often-stated promise to make things right in East Palestine.DeWine's spokesman, Dan Tierney, said the governor is glad the Biden administration “affirmed their long-term commitment to supporting the residents of East Palestine, including the consideration of federal disaster aid should Norfolk Southern not fulfill its obligation to fully compensate the residents of East Palestine and clean up the aftermath of the derailment.”East Palestine resident Jessica Conard said the order is a step in the right direction, but she still has concerns.“It’s a lofty title for an incremental change,” she said.In particular, she questioned how the FEMA coordinator will effectively assess unmet needs of residents without chemical testing to their bodies or homes.Story continues“I’m hopeful that we as residents can direct this narrative and that the emergency management services that are in place will support the residents through this process.”The railroad has reimbursed residents for relocation costs since the derailment and compensated the fire department for equipment that was damaged while fighting the fire and dealing with the chemicals that were released after the derailment. Norfolk Southern has also promised to pay for upgrading East Palestine's parks and water treatment center. On Thursday, the Atlanta-based railroad announced plans to build a $20 million regional training center for first responders in East Palestine.Norfolk Southern has also said it will establish funds to pay for lost home values, any long-term health concerns and water contamination issues that result from the derailment. The railroad announced a preliminary program to compensate homeowners earlier this week although the final details of those funds are still being negotiated with Ohio officials.The railroad said it is committed to helping East Palestine now and in the future.“From the beginning, Norfolk Southern has committed to making it right in East Palestine and covering all costs associated with the clean-up. In the months since, we have made significant progress, keeping our promises to safely and thoroughly clean the derailment site, support the needs of the community, and invest in its future,” Norfolk Southern said in a statement.Jami Wallace, who helps lead the East Palestine Unity Council group that's trying to get residents' concerns addressed, said it would be better if the federal government would step in and compensate residents directly and then seek reimbursement from the railroad instead of forcing residents to deal with Norfolk Southern.Also, she thinks more should be done to make sure the railroad does what it should.“Commitment to holding Norfolk Southern accountable? People are still sick and living in homes that haven’t been tested. They are begging NS for assistance to survive,” Wallace said.U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who co-sponsored a package of railroad safety reforms after the derailment that’s still awaiting a vote in the Senate, said it’s important to make sure that Norfolk Southern delivers on all its promises.“This is an overdue but welcomed step to support the people of East Palestine,” said Brown. “There is still much more work to do to make this community whole and I will continue to push the administration to deliver for East Palestine and hold Norfolk Southern accountable.”The White House said that if FEMA identifies needs that aren't being met or if Norfolk Southern changes the aid it is offering, it will reassess the disaster declaration.___Associated Press reporter Patrick Orsagos contributed to this report from Columbus, Ohio.]"

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)President Joe Biden has issued an executive order designed to ensure that Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) “continues meeting its obligations to the community” following the Feb. 3 derailment of an NS train in East Palestine, Ohio.The Wednesday order also directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency to appoint a federal disaster recovery coordinator to oversee long-term public and private recovery efforts.East Palestine and surrounding communities in Ohio and Pennsylvania have been impacted by the Feb. 3 derailment, which was followed by the venting of rail cars carrying vinyl chloride because of concerns that those rail cars could explode.Biden had gotten flak by some Republicans for not visiting East Palestine immediately following the incident, according to news reports.“As part of his commitment to the people of East Palestine, President Biden is today issuing an Executive Order to ensure that Norfolk Southern continues to be held accountable for this disaster, to address any of the disaster’s long-term effects, and to ensure federal assistance is available to affected communities should needs develop that are not met by Norfolk Southern,” Wednesday’s announcement said.Biden also directed several federal agencies to provide reports pertaining to their efforts in restoring the East Palestine community.The order directs the Environmental Protection Agency to provide a report on the status of air, soil and water monitoring, as well as determine whether NS has been complying with federal orders in response to the derailment. It also charges EPA to continue to direct the removal of contaminated soils and wastewater from the derailment site and continue monitoring the environment for any adverse effects or changes.Biden wants the Health and Human Services Administration (HHS) to monitor public health consequences as well as provide an update on public health testing. He also directed HHS and EPA to evaluate whether a public health emergency should be declared if HHS determines that medical conditions have developed as a result of the derailment.Story continuesBiden also wants the Department of Transportation and the National Transportation Safety Board to provide what follow-up actions it plans to pursue to ensure accountability.In response to the order, NS said in a release: “From the beginning, Norfolk Southern has committed to making it right in East Palestine and covering all costs associated with the clean-up. In the months since, we have made significant progress, keeping our promises to safely and thoroughly clean the derailment site, support the needs of the community, and invest in its future.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Coca-Cola is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$13b ÷ (US$98b - US$24b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Coca-Cola has an ROCE of 17%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Beverage industry average of 16%. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola roceIn the above chart we have measured Coca-Cola's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Coca-Cola.What Can We Tell From Coca-Cola's ROCE Trend?While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 17% and the business has deployed 28% more capital into its operations. Since 17% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesOne more thing to note, even though ROCE has remained relatively flat over the last five years, the reduction in current liabilities to 24% of total assets, is good to see from a business owner's perspective. This can eliminate some of the risks inherent in the operations because the business has less outstanding obligations to their suppliers and or short-term creditors than they did previously.The Bottom Line On Coca-Cola's ROCEThe main thing to remember is that Coca-Cola has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.If you want to continue researching Coca-Cola, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

OJJAARA is an orally administered drug for the treatment of myelofibrosis (MF) in adults with anemia.OJJAARA was approved by the FDA on Sep 15, 2023.The availability of the FDA-approved drug is expected to significantly solidify McKesson’s foothold in the global cancer treatment space and boost its U.S. Pharmaceutical business.Significance of the AvailabilityMF is a rare blood cancer that is characterized by constitutional symptoms, splenomegaly and progressive anemia. Per McKesson, MF affects approximately 20,000 patients in the United States, with around 40% of patients already anemic at the time of diagnosis and nearly all patients estimated to develop anemia with time.McKesson’s management believes that OJJAARA will likely address the significant unmet medical needs of MF patients and provide an additional option for treatment.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Straits Research, the global oncology cancer drugs market was valued at $148,050.6 million in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $288,636.6 million by 2030 at a CAGR of 7.7%. Factors like the rise in the incidence of various cancer conditions and the growing popularity of advanced therapies (such as biological and targeted drug therapies) are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the recent drug availability is expected to strengthen McKesson’s position in the global oncology care space.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, McKesson announced that Biologics by McKesson was selected by Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. as a specialty pharmacy provider for VANFLYTA (quizartinib).The same month, McKesson announced its first-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein it recorded robust increases in its overall revenues and adjusted earnings per share. This was primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, resulting from increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from retail national account customers and specialty and GLP-1 products.Story continuesIn June, McKesson announced the launch of its curated private brand of over-the-counter health and wellness products, Foster &amp; Thrive.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 26.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s 19.8% rise and the S&amp;P 500's 17.5% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksCurrently, McKesson carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 10.7% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 12.8%. McKesson’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 8.1%.McKesson is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its robust Biologics business. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter fiscal 2024 performance and its strength in the distribution market are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trends persist.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversStrength in Biologics: Investors are optimistic about McKesson’s robust Biologics business. Independent specialty pharmacy, Biologics by McKesson, has been making impressive progress lately. This month, the pharmacy was selected by GSK as a specialty pharmacy provider for OJJAARA (momelotinib).Last month, the pharmacy was selected by Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. as a specialty pharmacy provider for VANFLYTA (quizartinib).Strength in Distribution Market: McKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market, which raises investors’ optimism. The Distribution Solutions segment caters to a wide range of customers and businesses and stands to benefit from increased generic utilization, inflation in generics driven by several patent expirations in the next few years and an aging population.Per management, the uptick in the company’s U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments’ adjusted operating profit was driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government’s COVID-19 vaccine program, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: McKesson’s robust first-quarter fiscal 2024 results buoy optimism. The company recorded robust top-line and bottom-line performances and strength in its U.S. Pharmaceutical, Medical-Surgical Solutions and Prescription Technology Solutions segments.DownsidesWeak Trends: McKesson distributes generic pharmaceuticals, which are subject to price fluctuation. The Distribution Solutions segment continues to experience weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trends. Continued volatility, unfavorable pricing trends, reimbursement of generic drugs and significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches could have a material adverse impact on McKesson.Stiff Competition: Distribution Solutions faces stiff competition both in terms of price and service from various full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large-payer organizations. Moreover, the company depends on fewer suppliers for its products. As a result, it is not in a position to negotiate pricing.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc. DVA, HealthEquity, Inc.

LNGG is the world's first dedicated LNG ETF.Roundhill Investments (PRNewsfoto/Roundhill Investments)""LNG represents a transformative frontier in the energy sector, and its growth trajectory is evident from its rapidly expanding share within the global gas supply,"" said Dave Mazza, Chief Strategy Officer at Roundhill Investments. ""For climate conscious investors, LNGG offers a practical solution to invest in a transitional fuel source that is significantly cleaner than alternatives like coal.""Natural gas prices vary widely depending on a region's ability to produce the energy source domestically. For example, U.S Henry Hub gas prices have averaged $2.58 thus far in 2023, while European gas has traded at an average of $13.10.1 Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, allows for countries like the United States to effectively export natural gas to regions like the EU and Asia, capturing a spread and helping to balance global supply and demand.As a result, LNG's share in the global gas supply is projected to rise from 13% today to an impressive 23% by 2050.2 This growth will be driven by meeting escalating demand and a significant surge in anticipated spending on greenfield LNG projects in the upcoming years, with approved greenfield investments amounting to $27 billion in 2022 and a projected $42 billion in 2024.3  Meanwhile, spending on U.S. LNG projects is expected to amount to an estimated $100 billion over the next five years.4LNGG offers investors a rare combination in the energy sector — growth and income — with the Alerian LNG Index yielding 4.5% as of August 31, 2023.5Story continuesLNGG's exposures span across the LNG value chain, including Liquefaction, LNG Carriers, Regasification, and more.The fund's top holdings at launch include:HOLDINGS% WEIGHTINGCheniere Energy Inc16.1 %Santos Ltd14.1 %Woodside Energy Group Ltd13.4 %Tokyo Electric Power Co Holdings Inc4.8 %ENN Energy Holdings Ltd4.6 %Qatar Gas Transport Co Ltd4.2 %Golar LNG Ltd4.1 %New Fortress Energy Inc3.9 %FLEX LNG Ltd2.8 %Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd2.5 %NextDecade Corp2.4 %Kunlun Energy Co Ltd2.1 %Petronas Gas Bhd2.1 %Enbridge Inc2.1 %TotalEnergies SE2.0 %Shell PLC2.0 %Sempra2.0 %Exxon Mobil Corp2.0 %Chevron Corp2.0 %Korea Gas Corp1.9 %Holdings are subject to change.About Roundhill Investments:Roundhill Investments is a registered investment adviser focused on offering innovative financial products designed to offer exposure to investment themes that appeal to the next generation of investors.

For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Alerian LNG ETF please call 1-877-220-7649 or visit the website at roundhillinvestments.com/etf/lngg. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing.Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Alerian Liquefied Natural Gas Index. The Index is composed of the common stock of domestic and international companies in both developed and emerging markets, that are principally engaged in or derive significant revenue from the LNG industry. An Index cannot be invested in directly. Concentration Risk. Because the Fund's assets will be concentrated in an industry or group of industries to the extent the Index concentrates in a particular industry or group of industries, the Fund is subject to loss due to adverse occurrences that may affect that industry or group of industries. Oil &amp; Gas Producers Industry. Companies in the Oil and Gas Producers Industry (the Industry) are affected by worldwide energy prices and exploration and production costs. The Industry may have significant operations in areas at risk for natural disasters, social and political unrest, and environmental damage. These companies may also be at risk for increased government regulation and intervention, litigation, and negative publicity and public perception. Depositary Receipt Risk. Depositary receipts, including American depositary receipts, involve risks similar to those associated with investments in foreign securities, such as changes in political or economic conditions of other countries and changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies. Foreign &amp; Emerging Markets Risks. Investments in foreign securities may involve risks such as social and political instability, market illiquidity, exchange-rate fluctuations, a high level of volatility and limited regulation. Investing in emerging markets involves different and greater risks, as these countries are substantially smaller, less liquid, and more volatile than securities markets in more developed markets. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors have no track record or history on which to base their investment decision. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is ""non-diversified,"" it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a lesser number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. As a result, the Fund may be more exposed to the risks associated with and developments affecting an individual issuer or a lesser number of issuers than a fund that invests more widely. This may increase the Fund's volatility and cause the performance of a relatively small number of issuers to have a greater impact on the Fund's performance. Passive Management Risk. The fund is passively managed and attempts to mirror the composition and performance of the Alerian Liquefied Natural Gas Index. The Fund's returns may not match due to expenses incurred by the Fund or lack of precise correlation with the index. Tracking Error Risk. As with all index funds, the performance of the Fund and its Index may differ from each other for a variety of reasons. For example, the Fund incurs operating expenses and portfolio transaction costs not incurred by the Index. In addition, the Fund may not be fully invested in the securities of the Index at all times or may hold securities not included in the Index.The Roundhill Alerian LNG ETF is not issued, sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by VettaFi LLC or its affiliates (collectively, ""VettaFi"").

The permit is a major regulatory milestone for a proposed Phase 2 project, including the addition of two liquefaction trains (trains 3 and 4) capable of producing up to 13 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of liquefied natural gas (LNG).""Sempra Infrastructure is committed to investing in infrastructure opportunities that help enable a cleaner and more secure energy future,"" said Justin Bird, chief executive officer of Sempra Infrastructure. ""Today's FERC order is a significant step in our ability to advance the global energy transition, creating an opportunity to double the amount of secure and reliable U.S. natural gas that Port Arthur LNG can help deliver to global markets.""With Phase 1 currently under construction, the development of the proposed Phase 2 project could increase the total liquefaction capacity of the facility from approximately 13 Mtpa to approximately 26 Mtpa. The proposed project is also expected to include an additional LNG storage tank and marine berth and would benefit from some of the common facilities currently under construction that were previously approved as part of the Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 permitting process.Sempra Infrastructure continues to evaluate opportunities to develop the entirety of the Port Arthur site while also exploring potential projects to reduce the carbon intensity of its LNG, positioning Port Arthur as a flagship hub for the energy transition. The company is leveraging the integrated capabilities of its business segments to develop the proposed Port Arthur Pipeline Texas Connector project, the proposed Post Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector project and develop new gas storage facilities, all of which would serve the Port Arthur LNG facility.Story continuesTo further the advancement of the Port Arthur Energy Hub, the company recently acquired 38,000 acres of pore space and relevant surface rights to support the proposed Titan Carbon Sequestration project, which is proximal in location to the Port Arthur LNG facility. The project targets capturing carbon from Sempra Infrastructure's Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 and 2 projects that are currently under development and has the potential to unlock other net-zero energy infrastructure opportunities. This comprehensive development approach utilizes Sempra Infrastructure's broad development and operational expertise to enhance the total value of Port Arthur and can deliver significant value for the local community, opening up substantial avenues for economic growth opportunities for the region.""The value proposition of the proposed Port Arthur Energy Hub goes beyond monetary investment in the region,"" said Bird. ""The proposed projects by Sempra Infrastructure would create new, high-paying jobs, increase innovative business in the region and continue to bolster the reputation of the State of Texas as a global energy leader.""The Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project is under active marketing and development. The project could help meet future demand for U.S. LNG supplies expected to serve European, Asian and other global markets as countries look to enhance energy reliability and security, and displace coal in power production.The Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project is currently under construction and is designed to include two natural gas liquefaction trains, two LNG storage tanks and associated facilities.Development of the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project, the Titan Carbon Sequestration project, the proposed Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector project, proposed Port Arthur Texas Connector project and new gas storage facilities is contingent upon completing the required commercial agreements, securing and/or maintaining all necessary permits, obtaining financing, and reaching a final investment decision, among other factors.About Sempra InfrastructureSempra Infrastructure, headquartered in Houston, is focused on delivering energy for a better world by developing, building and operating, and investing in clean power, energy networks, and LNG and net-zero solutions that are expected to play a crucial role in the energy systems of the future.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries What Is LyondellBasell Industries's Net Debt?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that LyondellBasell Industries had US$11.7b in debt in June 2023; about the same as the year before. However, it also had US$2.51b in cash, and so its net debt is US$9.23b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is LyondellBasell Industries' Balance Sheet?The latest balance sheet data shows that LyondellBasell Industries had liabilities of US$7.02b due within a year, and liabilities of US$16.6b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$2.51b as well as receivables valued at US$3.81b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$17.3b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.This deficit isn't so bad because LyondellBasell Industries is worth a massive US$31.0b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.LyondellBasell Industries's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2.0 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its strong interest cover of 10.6 times, makes us even more comfortable. Importantly, LyondellBasell Industries's EBIT fell a jaw-dropping 55% in the last twelve months. If that earnings trend continues then paying off its debt will be about as easy as herding cats on to a roller coaster. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if LyondellBasell Industries can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, LyondellBasell Industries produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 74% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewLyondellBasell Industries's EBIT growth rate was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered cast it in a significantly better light. For example its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow was refreshing. Looking at all the angles mentioned above, it does seem to us that LyondellBasell Industries is a somewhat risky investment as a result of its debt. Not all risk is bad, as it can boost share price returns if it pays off, but this debt risk is worth keeping in mind. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for LyondellBasell Industries  you should be aware of.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

With a market capitalization of $2.32 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 0.4 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe rally was largely driven by new business production, higher single premium policy cancellations, growth in total mortgage origination volume and a strong capital position.NMI Holdings has a solid track record of beating earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 5.32%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 and 2024 earnings has moved 2.8% and 0.5% north, respectively, in the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism on the stock.Will the Bull Run Continue?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NMI Holdings’ 2023 earnings is pegged at $3.68 per share, indicating an 8.5% increase from the year-ago reported figure on 9.4% higher revenues of $572.81 million.

This reflects its efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurer continues to benefit from new business production, robust growth in high-quality and short portfolios as well as continued success in the capital and reinsurance markets.By virtue of resiliency and stability of the housing market, growth in total mortgage origination volume and increasing size of the U.S. mortgage insurance market, new insurance written (NIW), the primary driver of insurance-in-force (IIF) of National MI, is expected to improve. Also, the continued expansion of customer franchise, and growth in monthly and single premium policy production tied to the rise in customer franchise and market presence are expected to drive NIW of NMIH.NMI Holdings expects persistency to continue improving and driving further increases in the embedded portfolio value for the year. NMIH remains well-poised to gain from growth of IIF, increased policy pricing and higher single premium policy cancellations, which continue contributing to net premiums earned, one of the major determinants of revenue growth.Net investment income is expected to improve as the company would roll over more maturities at favorable and higher rates.NMI Holdings boasts a strong capital position and had total PMIERs available assets of $2.5 billion and net risk-based required assets of $1.3 billion at second-quarter end.

ITT.Industry: Diversified OperationsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2152407/3-top-stocks-from-the-flourishing-diversified-operations-industryThe Zacks Diversified Operations industry is grappling with reduced demand across several end markets due to lower consumer spending as a result of inflationary pressure. While the manufacturing sector remains in the contraction territory, the gradual uptick in manufacturing activities signals an improvement in demand for the industry. Easing supply chains and cost-control measures are expected to aid the bottom lines of these companies.Companies like General Electric, 3M Company and ITT Inc. are well-placed to capitalize on the buoyancy in the industry. About the IndustryThe Zacks Diversified Operations industry includes companies that operate in various end markets, including oil &amp; gas, industrial, electronics, power, aviation, technology, finance, healthcare, chemical, non-residential construction and transportation. Such companies manufacture and provide equipment and solutions, including bioprocessing products, molecular testing-related products, gas and steam turbines, generators, commercial jet engines and engineered fluid-process equipment.The industry players also provide related services to a large customer base. In addition, a few companies offer services in the agriculture, marine and telecommunications markets and are engaged in providing environmental and safety solutions. The diversified market operators have a vast global presence, with exposure in the United States, Japan, India, China, Canada and other countries.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Diversified Operations IndustryPersistent Weakness in the Manufacturing Sector: Continued weakness in the manufacturing sector has been weighing on demand in the industry. Per the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report, in August, the Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Manager's Index) touched 47.6%, contracting for the 10th consecutive month. A figure less than 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity.Story continuesThe New Orders Index remained in the contraction territory at 46.8%, declining 0.5 percentage points from the figure recorded in July. While the manufacturing sector remains in the contraction territory, it is showing signs of gradual improvement. The Manufacturing PMI has been steadily improving over the past few months. In August, the index increased 1.2 percentage points from the figure recorded in July. The uptick in manufacturing activities augurs well for the diversified operations industry.Inflationary Pressure: Companies with exposure to the electronics, healthcare and consumer verticals are experiencing lower demand due to reduced consumer spending as a result of inflationary pressure. Within the electronics division, there is softness, particularly for smartphones, tablets and TVs.Within the consumer segment, companies are witnessing a decline in home improvement, stationery and office businesses. Given the high inflation levels, consumer spending is likely to remain suppressed through 2023, weighing on the top line of these companies. Reduced demand in the residential end market is also a concern for the industry.Easing Supply-Chain Disruptions: While supply-chain disruptions persist, especially related to the availability of electronic components, the situation has improved, as evident from the ISM report's Supplier Deliveries Index, which reflected faster deliveries for the 11th straight month in August. Easing supply-chain issues should support diversified operations companies' growth in 2023. Cost-control measures support the margins of the industry participants despite inflationary pressure.Zacks Industry Rank Suggests Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Diversified Operations industry, housed within the broader Zacks Conglomerates sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #113. This rank places it in the top 45% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright prospects.

But it is worth taking a look at the industry's shareholder returns and its current valuation first.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500Over the past year, the Zacks Diversified Operations has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite index.

414,f1b1908e-007b-3096-83b0-7da2f484d8b9,GE,2023-09-22,General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 77% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-electric-company-nyse-ge-130027057.html,1695301227,STORY,['GE'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, General Electric's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 9 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have sold recently Every investor in General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 77% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of General Electric, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About General Electric?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in General Electric. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of General Electric, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. General Electric is not owned by hedge funds. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the largest shareholder, with 14% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.1% and 6.5% of the stock.Story continuesWe did some more digging and found that 9 of the top shareholders account for roughly 50% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of General ElectricThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of General Electric Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$329m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 23% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - General Electric has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which is potentially serious)  we think you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.Global stock markets experienced a retreat on September 21 in response to recent central bank decisions, notably from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The Federal Reserve's announcement of an extended period of elevated interest rates dampened market sentiment, leading to declines in stock prices. Concurrently, investors are anxiously awaiting the Bank of England's policy decision, which is uncertain due to softer inflation data. The Stoxx 600 Index witnessed a 0.7% decline in Europe, with nearly all industry sectors in negative territory. In the United States, futures contracts for major benchmarks slipped, extending the previous day's losses on Wall Street. Asian stock markets registered their most significant drop in over a month, reflecting concerns emanating from the Fed's policy stance and global economic uncertainties. Meanwhile, US Treasuries displayed mixed performance in the bond market, with certain yields edging higher. Simultaneously, the US dollar strengthened, often seen as a safe-haven asset during periods of market uncertainty.On the European side, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) ended its five consecutive interest rate hikes, keeping rates unchanged at 1.75% in its latest quarterly monetary policy meeting, reported CNBC. The SNB noted that the previous tightening of monetary policy effectively addressed inflationary pressure. Switzerland's inflation rate of 1.6% in August, below the 2% target, contributed to the decision. Despite Switzerland's strong economic performance and a robust Swiss franc, the central bank maintained its policy stance as the Swiss economy showed signs of stagnation in Q2. The Swiss Market Index was among the few European indices to trade positively following the SNB's decision. Looking ahead, the SNB recognized the global economic outlook remained subdued, with potential risks including a significant global economic slowdown and energy supply concerns in Europe. The central bank anticipates around 1% economic growth in Switzerland this year, with slight unemployment increases and reduced production capacity utilization.Story continuesOil prices declined on September 21, following the largest monthly drop in the previous session. This drop was driven by expectations of a U.S. interest rate hike, which overshadowed the impact of reduced U.S. crude stockpiles. Brent futures for November delivery fell 97 cents, or 1.04%, to $92.56 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) dropped 97 cents, or 1.08%, to $88.69, marking its lowest level since September 14. Both benchmarks had experienced declines of over $1 earlier in the day. The decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged at the recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, while signaling a potential rate increase by year-end, was viewed as a ""hawkish pause"" that added pressure to risk assets like oil, according to ING analysts. This hawkish stance also resulted in the U.S. dollar reaching its highest level since early March, making commodities like oil more expensive for buyers using other currencies. While data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) revealed a decrease in crude inventories in line with expectations, the decline was smaller than anticipated, causing some traders to lock in profits following a 10% gain since the start of the month. Despite these short-term factors, concerns about global supply tightness entering the fourth quarter persisted, with Cushing crude stocks at their lowest since July 2022 and ongoing production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies. In summary, oil prices retreated due to expectations of a U.S. interest rate hike, despite reductions in U.S. crude stockpiles. While short-term factors influenced the market, concerns about supply tightness remained a driving force.On the stock market front, analysts are bullish on tech stock Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) and Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ). Check out the complete article to see the details of these upward revisions in price targets.Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price TargetsPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on Unsplash10. Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY)Upside Potential: 3%Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is a significant player in the energy industry, engaged in the exploration, production, and marketing of oil and gas resources. It is an American oil and gas exploration and production company that operates in the United States, the Middle East, Canada, and Chile. In Canada and Chile, the company only operates its petrochemical manufacturing business. Citigroup analyst Scott Gruber raised the price target for Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) from $62.00 to $67.00 on September 20. Citigroup's decision to raise the price target for Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) to $66.00 indicates its confidence in the company's prospects. The new price target suggests an upside potential of 3% from the current trading price, underscoring Citigroup's belief in Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) ability to deliver strong results and maintain its competitive position in the energy sector. The earnings per share of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) substantially reduced, decreasing from $2.44 in Q3 2022 to 68 cents in Q2 2023. This underscores the magnitude of the adjustment towards industry norms that has transpired within the oil sector this year.In a manner akin to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS), and Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) has also seen analysts raise its price target.09. Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL)Upside Potential: 10%Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) is a chemicals company based in Saint Paul, Minnesota. It provides water treatment services and sanitization products for industrial use. The firm beat its second-quarter analyst EPS estimates. On September 20, Evercore ISI raised the price target for Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) from $170.00 to $195.00. As of the latest data available, the current price of Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) is $177.53, representing a 0.7% increase. The raised price target of $195.00 suggests a positive outlook on the stock from Evercore ISI, projecting a 10% upside potential as compared to the current market price of Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL). Similar to the way analysts have raised price targets for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS), and Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ), they have also increased their price target for Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL).Madison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) is benefiting from price increases put in place last year to offset inflationary pressures. The price increases more than offset flattish volumes and are modestly ahead of raw material inflation resulting in a return to earnings growth. We believe that Ecolab’s profitability will improve going forward from market share gains and its fast-growing bioprocessing business.”08. CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR)Upside Potential: 14%In a notable development within the technology sector, Bank of America has raised its price target for CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) from $187.00 to $198.00. This upgrade reflects growing optimism about the company's prospects in the cybersecurity market. As of the most recent data, CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) is trading at $172.94, representing a noteworthy 3.8% increase from its previous trading price. This surge in stock price aligns with the positive sentiment expressed by Bank of America through the raised price target. Bank of America's decision to increase the price target for CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) suggests a bullish outlook for the company's stock. The new price target of $198.00 implies a significant upside potential of 14% from the current trading price, signaling confidence in CyberArk's ability to deliver strong financial performance and maintain its competitive edge in the cybersecurity industry. The cybersecurity sector has been gaining prominence due to the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber threats across industries. Companies like CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) are critical in safeguarding sensitive data and digital assets from cyberattacks.Wasatch Small Cap Core Growth Strategy made the following comment about CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“IT accounted for several of the greatest detractors from strategy performance during the fourth quarter. Among these were Paylocity Holding Corp. (PCTY), CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) and Q2 Holdings, Inc. (QTWO).A cybersecurity company that operates globally, CyberArk specializes in products and services to protect and safeguard customers’ IT networks and devices. A recent flurry of buyouts by private equity firms has fostered an active rumor mill that’s at times produced rapid gyrations in the prices of cybersecurity stocks. We suspect CyberArk may have been the target of some of this speculation during the third quarter. Moreover, the growing slate of security products offered by cloud-computing giants Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and Google may have bruised investor sentiment toward the group.”07. AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO)Upside Potential: 15%On September 20, JP Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers increased the price target for AutoZone, one of the leading players in the automotive retail sector, from $2,950 to $2,975 while maintaining an ""Overweight"" rating for the stock. This adjustment in the price target reflects JP Morgan's optimistic outlook for the company's performance. As of the latest available market data, AutoZone is trading at $2,583.36, marking a notable 4.4% increase from its previous trading price. This surge in the stock price is aligned with the positive sentiment expressed by JP Morgan through the upward revision of the price target. JP Morgan's decision to raise the price target for AutoZone underscores its bullish stance on the company's stock. The new price target of $2,975 implies an upward potential of 15% from the current trading price, reinforcing JP Morgan's confidence in AutoZone's ability to deliver strong results and maintain its competitive position in the automotive retail sector.RGA Investment Advisors made the following comment about AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Below is a chart of Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) P/E ratio plotted against AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO). Any number of examples between large cap tech companies and more mature companies could illustrate this very same point, but we find this specific case most interesting because of its history.Note that in late 2014/early 2015 these multiples crossed one another. The relative harmony between Alphabet and Autozone lasted for just shy of a year at that time, before Alphabet’s shares surged and Autozone’s shares slumped. This relationship need not matter for markets, though we think there is some signal for investors. Autozone today trades at the highest multiples of its recent history, while Alphabet trades at its lowest. Meanwhile, despite growth estimates dropping considerably at Alphabet and appreciating modestly at Autozone, Alphabet will outgrow Autozone by a wide margin over the next five years…” (Click here to read the full text)06.

Market participants were widely expecting a status quo. However, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell destroyed the initial enthusiasm of investors.Consequently, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — slid 0.2%, 0.9% and 1.5%, respectively. The small-cap benchmark — the Russell 2000 — also declined 0.9%.More Interest Rate Hike LikelyAlthough the Fed paused rate hike in the September FOMC meeting, the current dot-plot has shown a strong likelihood of one more hike of 25 basis points in 2023. That will take the terminal interest rate of this hiking cycle to 5.6%, well above the 5.1% forecast in June. Notably, the current range of the Fed fund rate is the highest level since March 2001.More importantly, the central bank said it would keep higher interest rates for a longer time period. The new projection has shown two rate cuts in 2024 instead of four projected in June. The Fed expects the U.S. economy to grow at a healthy 2.1% in 2023 and the core PCE price index — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — to stay at 3.7% this year, well above its 2% target level. Strong GDP growth rate and stubborn inflation compel the central bank to continue restrictive monetary policies for a longer period.Powell said, “We’re in a position to proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming.” However, he also said, “We want to see convincing evidence really that we have reached the appropriate level, and we’re seeing progress and we welcome that. But, you know, we need to see more progress before we’ll be willing to reach that conclusion.”At this stage, it should be prudent to stay safe as volatile trading pattern that we are witnessing in the past one and a half months may continue in the fourth quarter of 2023.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five stocks from defensive sectors like utilities, consumer staples and healthcare.

One such stock that merits attention is Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO). Currently priced at $22.94, the stock recorded an 8.97% loss in a day and a 3-month increase of 48.26%. However, the stock's fair valuation, as indicated by its GF Value, is $39.95.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with VNO. Click here to check it out. VNO 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VNOThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. It is calculated based on historical multiples, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapDelving Deeper into Vornado Realty Trust's Financial HealthInvestors must consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Vornado Realty Trust should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.11, and the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years. This raises the question: Is Vornado Realty Trust a hidden gem or a value trap?Understanding the Altman Z-ScoreThe Altman Z-score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. It combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany SnapshotVornado Realty Trust is a real estate investment trust that owns and has an ownership interest in Class A office and retail properties highly concentrated in Manhattan, with additional properties in San Francisco and Chicago. Despite its low price, the company's declining revenues and earnings, along with a low Altman Z-score, suggest that it might be a potential value trap.Is Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapExamining Vornado Realty Trust's Financial HealthA closer look at Vornado Realty Trust's Altman Z-score suggests possible financial distress. The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Vornado Realty Trust's historical data, we observe a declining trend in this ratio, indicating a diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt.Declining Revenues and Earnings: A Cause for ConcernA sustained decline in revenues is often a sign of a company's potential trouble. In the case of Vornado Realty Trust, both the revenue per share and the 5-year revenue growth rate have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for Vornado Realty Trust's products, or escalating competition in its market sector.More worrying is the negative 3-year EBITDA growth rate and the 5-year EBITDA growth rate. This could indicate structural problems within the company, as EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is often used as a measure of a company's operating performance.Is Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapConclusionDespite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, Vornado Realty Trust's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the Walter Schloss Screen .

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Airlines AAL, Delta Air Lines DAL, United Airlines UAL, Spirit Airlines SAVE and Hawaiian Holdings HA.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Airline Industry Depreciates -7.1% in the Last Month: Here's WhyIt is a well-documented fact that the stronger-than-expected bounce back of air travel has served as a huge boon for airline stocks. With passenger revenues accounting for most of the top line, airline revenues are moving northwards in the post-COVID-19 scenario.Air travel demand is not only strong on the leisure front (pent-up demand for international travel is the most vital driver of leisure travel), but what is more encouraging is that business travel is coming back as pandemic-related restrictions are removed. Despite the bullish scenario concerning the top line, the Zacks Airline industry has shed 7.1% of its value in a month's time, against the S&amp;P 500's 0.4% uptick.Let's delve deep to unearth the reasons behind the disappointing price performance despite the bright top-line scenario.The northward movement in oil prices is not a welcome development for airline stocks. This is because expenses on fuel represent a significant input cost for airlines. Therefore, an increase in fuel costs hurts bottom-line growth. Recently, oil prices crossed the $90-per-barrel mark for the first time since November. The northward movement in crude price is primarily due to the extension of production cut by Saudi Arabia and Russia through the end of the current year.The sharp rise in one of the primary input costs of airlines is likely to hurt the bottom-line growth of the stocks in the third quarter of 2023. The development has caused key airline stocks, including the likes of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and Spirit Airlines, to increase their September quarter projections for fuel price per gallon.Story continuesAmerican Airlines' management stated that ""fuel prices have increased considerably since the company's initial third-quarter guidance issued on Jul 20, 2023"". American Airlines now expects the fuel cost per gallon (including taxes) in the $2.90-$3.00 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.55-$2.65 range). DAL now expects fuel price per gallon in the $2.75 - $2.90 range (earlier guidance: $2.50 - $2.70).Spirit Airlines' management now expects third-quarter fuel cost per gallon to be $3.06, against the earlier projection of $2.80.  United Airlines now expects the fuel cost per gallon in the $2.95-$3.05 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.5-$2.8 range).As if high fuel costs were not enough, labor costs also increase courtesy of the multiple labor deals witnessed in the space. Given the high air-travel demand and the labor crunch in the post-COVID-19 scenario, the bargaining power of various labor groups has increased.Another headwind has emanated from the devastation caused by wildfire to the Lahaina town in West Maui. This has affected Hawaiian Holdings, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), the most.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Due to the reduced travel demand to Maui from the U.S. Mainland and Neighbor Islands, HA now expects third-quarter 2023 total revenues per available seat miles to decrease 4-7% from third-quarter 2022 levels (prior projection: 2-5% decline).What's Ahead for Airlines?With people again taking to the skies, passenger revenues are likely to remain strong. However, costs are likely to stay high, in turn hurting the bottom-line growth of airlines.The International Energy Agency recently said that the actions of Saudi Arabia and Russia will lead to a supply deficit through the December quarter. This implies that oil prices will remain high, which is a bane for airlines' bottom lines. We expect pay-related deals with labor groups to continue, at least in the near term. Consequently, high labor costs are also likely to eat into profitability.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

However, only 45% of women employees compared to 58% of men employees were confident about money management and only 22% of women considered themselves knowledgeable about investing compared to nearly half of men (46%).Playing the Long GameThe survey revealed female employees are taking a longer-term approach when it comes to their money. The majority of women (55%) hold their investments in an economic downturn as compared to 40% of men. Additionally, one-third of men (32%) rebalance their portfolio or sell shares during economic downturns compared to only 16% of women who rebalance or sell.""The good news is that women are focused on precisely the right financial threats and aren’t allowing a volatile economy to derail them. In fact, when it comes to making investing decisions, women – who have long had a reputation for being risk-averse – seem to have turned an important corner in their investment decisions,"" says Jean Chatzky, CEO of HerMoney.com.When it comes to financial guidance, 59% of women reported not working with a financial professional (compared to 50% of men), even though 60% view them as the most trusted resources for making investment decisions. Compared to men, women are using a wider variety of resources to learn about investing through podcasts (44% vs. 27%), books (40% vs. 26%), and workplace programs (25% vs.15%).Story continues""While employees’ needs are varied, almost everyone can benefit from more guidance, education, and support to build their financial acumen and confidence,"" said Teresa Hassara, senior vice president of workplace savings and retirement solutions at Principal Financial Group. ""At Principal®, we understand individuals have moments in life when they may not feel fully confident in making financial decisions. So, we help employers become more intentional with the workplace solutions they offer — making available a balance of one-on-one, digital, and dedicated advisor interactions for their employees. The more personalized the experience, the more success we believe individuals will have when it comes to achieving long-term financial security and retirement goals.""Financial Wellness Resources in ActionThe survey also focused on how workplace wellness programs are evolving to help employees build a stable financial foundation today and for the future. When comparing what employees are looking for from these programs – and how they’re using them – the results were uneven by gender.Women employees (40%) are more likely than men (32%) to say financial wellness feels like ""being at peace (without financial stress)."" And yet, significantly more men (28%) than women (18%) report a reduction in their own stress levels due to the financial wellness programs at their companies.Additionally, when asked how various elements of the financial wellness programs offered by their employer are utilized, while both women and men reported awareness and use of resources available to them, men reported stronger results. Men, more than women, credit their employer’s financial wellness programs with helping them increase their emergency savings (25% vs 13%), reduce debt (21% vs 9%), and improve their setting of financial goals (23% vs 15%).""While it’s heartening to see these programs are helping move the needle in the right direction, these survey results show an imbalance in value, which could be stunting the financial stability of women who need more support tackling the building blocks of personal finance,"" Chatzky says. ""At the end of the day, companies offer financial wellness programs so their employees can feel just that — financially well. In this area of support, we still have a long way to go.""ABOUT THE STUDY:The 2023 State of Women is based on an online study conducted in August 2023 among 900 women and men ranging in age from 18 to 75 who are employed full-time at small and midsize employers, with access to either health insurance or a retirement savings plan as a benefit.ABOUT PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL GROUPPrincipal Financial Group® (Nasdaq: PFG) is a global financial company with 19,000 employees1 passionate about improving the wealth and well-being of people and businesses.

440,56103956-0685-3004-aa67-63dc4a1fc662,AWK,2023-09-22,Fed Dampens Wall Street Sentiments: 5 Safe Stock Picks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-dampens-wall-street-sentiments-121000701.html,1695298200,STORY,"['HCA', 'COMP', '^RUT', '^GSPC', 'VST', 'PG', 'PEP', 'AWK']","[On Sep 20, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate unchanged at the existing 5.25-5.5% range at its September FOMC meeting. Market participants were widely expecting a status quo. However, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell destroyed the initial enthusiasm of investors.Consequently, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — slid 0.2%, 0.9% and 1.5%, respectively. The small-cap benchmark — the Russell 2000 — also declined 0.9%.More Interest Rate Hike LikelyAlthough the Fed paused rate hike in the September FOMC meeting, the current dot-plot has shown a strong likelihood of one more hike of 25 basis points in 2023. That will take the terminal interest rate of this hiking cycle to 5.6%, well above the 5.1% forecast in June. Notably, the current range of the Fed fund rate is the highest level since March 2001.More importantly, the central bank said it would keep higher interest rates for a longer time period. The new projection has shown two rate cuts in 2024 instead of four projected in June. The Fed expects the U.S. economy to grow at a healthy 2.1% in 2023 and the core PCE price index — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — to stay at 3.7% this year, well above its 2% target level. Strong GDP growth rate and stubborn inflation compel the central bank to continue restrictive monetary policies for a longer period.Powell said, “We’re in a position to proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming.” However, he also said, “We want to see convincing evidence really that we have reached the appropriate level, and we’re seeing progress and we welcome that. But, you know, we need to see more progress before we’ll be willing to reach that conclusion.”At this stage, it should be prudent to stay safe as volatile trading pattern that we are witnessing in the past one and a half months may continue in the fourth quarter of 2023.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five stocks from defensive sectors like utilities, consumer staples and healthcare.

441,2b0cd82f-5773-3883-a5b3-6ac1b5670107,PEP,2023-09-22,Is PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Using Too Much Debt?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-nasdaq-pep-using-too-110017726.html,1695380417,STORY,['PEP'],"[Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo What Is PepsiCo's Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at June 2023 PepsiCo had debt of US$43.6b, up from US$39.3b in one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$6.45b, its net debt is less, at about US$37.2b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is PepsiCo's Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that PepsiCo had liabilities of US$29.6b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$48.5b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$6.45b as well as receivables valued at US$11.5b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$60.2b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since PepsiCo has a huge market capitalization of US$241.4b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).PepsiCo's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2.4 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its strong interest cover of 21.2 times, makes us even more comfortable. PepsiCo grew its EBIT by 2.1% in the last year. That's far from incredible but it is a good thing, when it comes to paying off debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if PepsiCo can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, PepsiCo recorded free cash flow worth 52% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewOn our analysis PepsiCo's interest cover should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. However, our other observations weren't so heartening. For example, its net debt to EBITDA makes us a little nervous about its debt. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that PepsiCo is managing its debt quite well. Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for PepsiCo   you should know about.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

442,56103956-0685-3004-aa67-63dc4a1fc662,PEP,2023-09-22,Fed Dampens Wall Street Sentiments: 5 Safe Stock Picks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-dampens-wall-street-sentiments-121000701.html,1695298200,STORY,"['HCA', 'COMP', '^RUT', '^GSPC', 'VST', 'PG', 'PEP', 'AWK']","[On Sep 20, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate unchanged at the existing 5.25-5.5% range at its September FOMC meeting. Market participants were widely expecting a status quo. However, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell destroyed the initial enthusiasm of investors.Consequently, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — slid 0.2%, 0.9% and 1.5%, respectively. The small-cap benchmark — the Russell 2000 — also declined 0.9%.More Interest Rate Hike LikelyAlthough the Fed paused rate hike in the September FOMC meeting, the current dot-plot has shown a strong likelihood of one more hike of 25 basis points in 2023. That will take the terminal interest rate of this hiking cycle to 5.6%, well above the 5.1% forecast in June. Notably, the current range of the Fed fund rate is the highest level since March 2001.More importantly, the central bank said it would keep higher interest rates for a longer time period. The new projection has shown two rate cuts in 2024 instead of four projected in June. The Fed expects the U.S. economy to grow at a healthy 2.1% in 2023 and the core PCE price index — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — to stay at 3.7% this year, well above its 2% target level. Strong GDP growth rate and stubborn inflation compel the central bank to continue restrictive monetary policies for a longer period.Powell said, “We’re in a position to proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming.” However, he also said, “We want to see convincing evidence really that we have reached the appropriate level, and we’re seeing progress and we welcome that. But, you know, we need to see more progress before we’ll be willing to reach that conclusion.”At this stage, it should be prudent to stay safe as volatile trading pattern that we are witnessing in the past one and a half months may continue in the fourth quarter of 2023.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five stocks from defensive sectors like utilities, consumer staples and healthcare. These stocks have strong potential for the rest of 2023 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days.Story continuesMoreover, these companies are regular dividend payers which will act as an income stream during market’s downturn.

(Photo: Port of Eagle Pass)Cross-border truck drivers are facing hourslong wait times at two Texas ports of entry as an influx of migrants and renewed state-run truck inspections are disrupting trade flows between Mexico and the U.S.The inspections overseen by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) resumed Wednesday at the Ysleta-Zaragoza International Bridge in El Paso and the Camino Real Bridge in Eagle Pass. DPS initiated similar inspections in El Paso last December.The checkpoints launched by the Texas DPS are in addition to commercial truck inspections conducted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, further slowing truck crossings because each truck has to stop for an additional examination.DPS officials said the renewed inspections were aimed at stopping cartels from smuggling drugs across the border.“We hope that frequent enhanced commercial vehicle safety inspections will help deter cartel smuggling activity along our southern border while increasing the safety of our roadways,” DPS Director Steven McCraw said in a statement to the El Paso Times.DPS officials declined to comment on how long the state-run inspections would continue.The increased inspections at the Ysleta-Zaragoza and Camino Real bridges are increasing wait times at border crossings already being disrupted by a large increase of migrants arriving at the Texas-Mexico border in recent days.CBP agents that would normally help process commercial cargo trucks are being shifted to immigration duties to handle the inflow of migrants.Cargo truck wait times at the Ysleta-Zaragoza Bridge are currently over 100 minutes in the general commercial lanes and 80 minutes for vehicles permitted for the Free and Secure Trade program lanes.On Monday, CBP suspended cargo truck operations at the Bridge of Americas border crossing in El Paso, forcing all commercial traffic to use alternative bridges, such as Ysleta-Zaragoza, the Marcelino Serna port of entry or the Santa Teresa port of entry in New Mexico. It’s unclear when cargo operations will resume at the Bridge of the Americas.Story continuesOn Wednesday, CBP closed Bridge I in Eagle Pass due to a surge of migrants arriving in the area. Eagle Pass’s Bridge II, also known as the Camino Real Bridge, remains open with one lane for cargo trucks.The DPS inspections are also causing long wait times at the Camino Real Bridge, said Armando Taboada, assistant director of field operations at CBP’s Laredo Field Office.Cargo truck wait times at the Camino Real Bridge are currently over 180 minutes, according to the CBP website.“DPS is slowing down the ability to exit the import commercial cargo lot and creating long crossing border wait times,” Taboada said in an email to the trade community Thursday. “The Port of Del Rio is the closest port of entry in proximity to Eagle Pass and able to handle diverted commercial truck shipments.”CBP also closed the rail bridge in Eagle Pass on Wednesday in order to redirect personnel to assist Border Patrol with taking migrants into custody.“No railroad traffic will be processed until further notice,” Taboada said.Union Pacific said Thursday that freight service through South Texas is delayed because of the closure in Eagle Pass.“Union Pacific’s other gateways cannot handle the extra traffic and we are notifying our customers of an embargo at Eagle Pass, effective immediately,” Union Pacific said in a news release. “This will help us better manage your shipments during this dynamic and rapidly developing situation.”Watch: What the Truck?!? discusses entry-level driver training issues; freight market drops and fuel rises.Click for more FreightWaves articles by Noi Mahoney.More articles by Noi MahoneyCBP halts commercial truck processing at Texas port of entryBorderlands: Mexico remains top US trade partner in JulyCH Robinson expands border footprint with major facility in TexasThe post Texas resumes truck inspections along Mexico border amid migrant surge appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

But the acquisition — Cisco’s biggest ever — is unlikely to revitalize the Silicon Valley stalwart by itself, raising the question of whether more deals are on the horizon.Cisco was once the envy of the tech world. When the internet was first being built out, the company’s networking switches and routers were a prized commodity. During the dot-com era, it briefly eclipsed Microsoft Corp. as the most valuable company — with a half-trillion-dollar market capitalization.Read More: Splunk, a Cave Diver for Data, Lures $28 Billion Cisco BidCisco is still the biggest seller of networking gear, but it’s become a less exciting business. The market is characterized by large but often infrequent purchases, and many big buyers of equipment switched to cheaper alternatives. Under Robbins, Cisco has been trying to pivot to a subscriber and services model that keeps the money flowing.That’s where Splunk comes in. Its data services have benefited from the boom in cloud computing and AI, and provide the kind of customer relationships Cisco is looking for. That’s why Robbins offered a premium of 31% over Splunk’s share price in cash — a transaction that’s equal to about 10% of Cisco’s $216 billion market value.Story continuesThe price jarred investors, who sent Cisco shares down 3.9% on Thursday. On Friday, the stock rose less than 1% to $53.37 in New York.Robbins pitched the deal as a chance to strengthen Cisco’s offerings in markets that are growing quickly. It also will build on initiatives that he’s already put in place through smaller deals and internal investments, he said. Splunk tools allow subscribers to better protect their networks and diagnose where — and how — something has gone wrong.The computing and networking industry is changing far more quickly now, and Cisco can create value from the massive growth in data, Robbins told analysts Thursday. Splunk also will help speed the rollout of AI products.Robbins, who joined Cisco in 1997, worked his way up through various positions in the San Jose, California-based company, including a stint as worldwide head of sales, before taking the CEO job.In response to new trends in networking, he opened up Cisco’s gear so that customers can buy just the parts they want — down to individual components. He’s added more software and services, mostly provided via the cloud, mirroring a shift at Microsoft toward long-term relationships.That’s one area where Splunk will help Cisco accelerate its efforts, said Chief Financial Officer Scott Herren. Splunk will bring in $4 billion of recurring sales, he said in an interview. That builds on the $24 billion in recurring revenue that Cisco took in last year, out of a total of $57 billion.“That’s the benefit of having made this transformation,” Herren said. “It gives us much more predictability and much more visibility into our results. And so it’s lower risk.”While people still think of Cisco as a seller of switches and routers, they should remember that the hardware is now sold with software and services, he said. That keeps customers in its orbit.But Cisco may need to make further acquisitions to complete its transition, said Daniel Morgan, a fund manager at Synovus Trust. A string of earlier purchases didn’t do much to move the needle, he said. And even Splunk will only accomplish so much.“Cisco needs to do more of these type of larger deals to boost top-line growth as their core traditional business becomes mature,” Morgan said. Splunk helps Cisco’s security business, but “the impact is muted” because that unit is still relatively small, he said.Herren acknowledges that Cisco may have to spend money to make money. Speeding up growth is a central mission at the company, and the motivation behind the Splunk deal, he said.“That’s one of our top priorities for our capital allocation,” he said. “And that’s really what was what motivated this.”(Updates with stock reaction in sixth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA $12 Million Request to Cover a Crypto Scam Sank a Bank CEOPrivate Equity’s Slow Carnage Unleashes a Wave of ZombiesWhy Retiring in India No Longer Requires Living With the KidsBengaluru Grapples With Fallout From India’s Breakneck GrowthRugby Has a Plan to Get Americans Excited About the Other World Cup©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"
