EQIX recently announced the addition of five new long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) in Spain, aggregating 225 megawatts (MW). The move considerably increased the company’s backing of renewable power projects.Reflecting positive sentiments, shares of EQIX gained 1.77% on Mar 2 normal trading session on the NYSE.Once operations of the projects begin in 2025, it is likely to produce enough power to match consumption at Equinix's International Business Exchange™ (IBX®) data centers in Madrid, Barcelona and Seville.Equinix’s contracted PPA capacity is expected to touch 595 MW globally with the addition of these five new projects to its existing projects. This is estimated to generate almost 2 million MWh annually, making EQIX’s latest move a strategic fit.Given that the locations of the new projects have an average solar radiation value above other geographical zones within Spain, EQIX’s goal of supporting renewable power generation globally is likely to be met.The projects are set to be managed by IGNIS, a Madrid-based integrated renewable energy group involved in the entire value chain, from development to operation and energy solutions. IGNIS presently manages an operational portfolio of more than 4 GW of different generation technologies.In a similar move, in late 2021 and early 2022, Equinix signed three PPAs in Finland for 144 MW of new-build wind capacity from the Bjorkliden, Lumivaara and Storbotet projects with renewable providers Neoen and Prokon.Moreover, in tandem with its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, Equinix became the first colocation data center operator to introduce a program by which it can reduce its overall power use by increasing operating temperature ranges within its data centers in December 2022.Over time, this initiative will help thousands of Equinix customers to reduce the Scope 3 carbon emissions associated with their data center operations.The growing reliance on technology and acceleration in digital transformation strategies by enterprises have led to a rise in demand for data centers, benefiting data center REITs like Equinix.Additionally, growth in artificial intelligence, as well as autonomous vehicle and virtual/augmented reality markets, is expected to be robust over the next five-six years, providing excellent growth opportunities for this data center REIT.EQIX currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Shares have lost about 1.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Aflac due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Aflac's Q4 Earnings Beat on Lower Benefits and ExpensesAflac reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.29, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. The bottom line increased 0.8% year over year.AFL’s revenues dropped 26.2% year over year to $4,010 million in the quarter under review. The top line missed the consensus mark by 10.7%.Strong fourth-quarter earnings were supported by reduced benefits and expenses, and improved profit levels from the U.S. businesses. The positives were partially offset by lower net investment income and weaker performance in the Japan unit.2022 PerformanceAdjusted 2022 EPS declined 10.3% from a year ago to $5.33. Total revenues fell 11.8% to $19,502 million.

Pretax adjusted earnings of the segment amounted to $704 million, which tumbled 20.6% year over year in the fourth quarter.New annualized premium sales of $115 million improved 11.4% year over year. The benefit ratio of the segment was 66.2% in the fourth quarter.Story continuesAflac U.S.The segment reported adjusted revenues of $1,621 million, which climbed 0.1% year over year in the quarter under review.

The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.2%.Adjusted net investment income of $192 million slipped 2.5% year over year. Pretax adjusted earnings of the segment were $340 million, up 30.3% year over year in the fourth quarter due to reduced benefits recognized.Aflac U.S. sales of $545 million grew 17.4% year over year.

It had 116.6 million shares left for buyback as of 2022-end.Management announced dividends of 42 cents per share for the first quarter of 2023, marking a 5% increase. The dividend will be paid out on Mar 1, 2023, to its shareholders of record as of Feb 15.OutlookAflac estimates improved sales in its Japan business for 2023, buoyed by improving pandemic conditions, product launches and product updates. The benefit ratio normalized in the fourth quarter and the momentum is expected to continue.Management also remains optimistic about strong sales results within its U.S. business. Improving productivity, contributions from platforms like network dental and vision and group life, and disability are expected to continue supporting the results.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.VGM ScoresCurrently, Aflac has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Aflac has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerAflac belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry.

Aflac AFL, Unum Group UNM, Employers Holdings EIG and AMERISAFE AMSF should continue benefiting from prudent underwriting standards. However, a rise in claims frequency could weigh on the positives.The industry has been witnessing soft pricing over the past several quarters, which is not expected to change any time soon. Nonetheless, a rise in claims, with business activities returning to normal levels, is likely to increase pricing for this industry. Also, the increasing adoption of technology in operations will help in the smooth functioning of the industry amid coronavirus-induced challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies providing workers’ compensation insurance, mainly to employers operating in hazardous industries. These companies offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products. Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employees’ pay. Claims are generally met by insurers or state-run workers’ compensation fund, benefiting both employers and employees. While it boosts employees’ morale, and, in turn, productivity, employers stand to benefit from lower claims costs. As awareness about the benefits of having such coverage rises, the future of these insurers seems bright. Per reports published in IBISWorld, the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry is estimated to grow 0.9% to $55 billion in 2023 based on revenues.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Accident &amp; Health Insurance IndustryPricing Pressure to Continue: The worker compensation industry has been witnessing pricing pressure over the past several quarters. Given this soft pricing, efforts to retain market share will increase pricing pressure, which might curb top-line growth.  With commercial and industrial activities back on track, the demand for insurance coverage is likely to be on the rise. SpendEdge estimates workers compensation insurance pricing to increase at a five-year (2022-2026) CAGR of 5.25%. Per a report published in Business Insurance, this line of business should continue to remain profitable in 2023 while rates should continue to trend downward.Claims Frequency Might Rise: The accident and health insurance space has witnessed growth over the years, primarily driven by an increase in benefits offered by employers. The right kind of workers’ compensation policy translates into personal care for injured workers, increased productivity, higher employee morale, lower turnover, reduced claims costs and less financial worry amid rising medical costs. Increasing underwriting exposure, sustained decrease in claims frequency rates attributable to a better working environment and conservative reserve levels have been boosting the industry’s performance. Per The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data in an AmTrust Financial report, workers over the age of 55 will increase to about 25% in 2024 from 21.7% in 2014. Thus, claims could rise based on the magnitude of severity, the report states. Also, with business activities getting normal, claims may rise.Increasing Adoption of Technology: The industry is witnessing accelerated adoption of technology in operations. Telemedicine has gained pace amid the pandemic. Carriers started selling policies online that appealed to the tech-savvy population. Given the current pandemic, several organizations are working remotely to comply with social distancing norms. Electronic applications, e-signatures, electronic policy delivery, cloud computing and blockchain should help insurers gain a competitive edge. Nonetheless, higher spending on technological advancements will result in escalated expense ratios.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects.

Shares have lost about 5.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Qorvo due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Qorvo Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Decline Y/YQorvo reported healthy third-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the bottom and the top line surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the Greensboro, NC-based company reported year-over-year lower revenues due to weak end-market demand, elevated inventories in the post-pandemic market, underutilization of manufacturing facilities and global uncertainty.Net IncomeGAAP net loss in the reported quarter was $15.9 million or loss of 16 cents against a net income of $216.3 million or $1.95 per share in the prior-year quarter. The sharp bottom-line contraction was attributable to a significant decline in net sales.Non-GAAP earnings in the reported quarter were $76.5 million or 75 cents per share, down from $330.4 million or $2.98 per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11 cents despite the year-over-year decline.RevenuesRevenues fell to $743.3 million from $1,114 million in the year-ago quarter. However, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $727 million and it was well above the midpoint of management’s guidance. Despite witnessing a solid performance in broadband, automotive, defense and silicon, higher channel inventories in the post-pandemic scenario and a waning end market demand hampered company’s revenues.Qorvo’s High Power Amplifier (HPA) witnessed a year-over-year decline as revenues amounted to $155 million in the December quarter, down from $182 million in the year-ago quarter. Weakness in the consumer-facing market, like SSDs and inventory consumption in the 5G base station market, stunted growth in defense and silicon carbide power devices.Low demand for WIFI products and inventory consumption also induced a fall in net sales in the company’s Connectivity &amp; Sensors Products Group. Revenue dropped to $97 million from $158 million in the corresponding quarter previous year.The company witnessed a 36% revenue contraction from the prior-year quarter’s levels in the Advanced Cellular Products Group. Revenues declined from $775 million in the same quarter last year to $491 million this quarter. Record decline in smartphone shipment in the December quarter associated with high inventory hampered Qorvo’s top-line performance in the segment.Story continuesOther DetailsOn a GAAP basis, gross profit totaled $268.1 million compared with $548.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating expenses increased to $259.3 million from $252.1 million in the prior-year quarter.Non-GAAP gross margin was 40.9% compared with 52.6% in the year-ago quarter. Lower factory utilization and higher inventory-related challenges are the primary factors for this reduction. Due to OpEx discipline, the timing of product development expenditure and fewer employee-related expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter were $205.7 million, down from $214.2 million in the prior year.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityAs of Dec 31, 2022, QRVO had $918.8 million in cash and cash equivalents with $2,047.7 million of long-term debt compared with respective tallies of $972.6 million and  $2,047.1 million in the year-ago period. Free cash flow at the end of the December quarter was $203 million, up from the prior year’s figure of 66.5 million.OutlookThe company anticipates that the smartphone market situation will improve in the March quarter as more customers will enter the market. It experienced a 20% decrease in total channel inventory for its components in the Android ecosystem during the December quarter alone. Management expects supply-demand adjustments will continue further during the next quarter and its business volume will recover later this year.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, Qorvo expects revenues to be $600-$640 million. The company estimates a non-GAAP gross margin of around 41% and non-GAAP earnings in the range of 10-15 cents per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted -116.14% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Qorvo has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Qorvo has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:TMO) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-inc-nyse-130019566.html,1677934819,STORY,['TMO'],"[With its stock down 4.7% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on Thermo Fisher Scientific's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Thermo Fisher Scientific is:16% = US$7.0b ÷ US$44b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.16 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Thermo Fisher Scientific's Earnings Growth And 16% ROETo start with, Thermo Fisher Scientific's ROE looks acceptable. Even when compared to the industry average of 14% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This probably goes some way in explaining Thermo Fisher Scientific's significant 27% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Thermo Fisher Scientific's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 31% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Thermo Fisher Scientific's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Thermo Fisher Scientific Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Thermo Fisher Scientific's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 5.9%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 94% of its profits. So it looks like Thermo Fisher Scientific is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Besides, Thermo Fisher Scientific has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 4.9%. Regardless, the future ROE for Thermo Fisher Scientific is predicted to rise to 26% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Thermo Fisher Scientific's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Most Profitable Biotech Stocks Today.The term ""biotechnology"" refers to the utilization of living organisms or biological systems to create solutions that address various agricultural, industrial, and health-related problems. The most well-known application of biotechnology is the use of genetic engineering to produce therapeutic proteins and other medications. Biotech's comparative advantage over Big Pharma is its increased return on investment. According to a Deloitte report, biotech firms can produce a return on R&amp;D of 9.3% as opposed to a 1.9% return for multinational pharmaceuticals.The biotechnology sector played a crucial role in the fight against COVID-19 in 2020. BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), a German biotechnology company, was responsible for the first COVID vaccine to receive FDA approval, which was later manufactured and marketed in partnership with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines by the biotech industry was a remarkable feat that garnered much attention and appreciation. This, in turn, led to a surge in investor interest, and the biotech IPO boom of 2020 and 2021 saw 158 companies going public.12 Most Profitable Biotech Stocks TodayPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashIn 2021, Venture Capitalists invested in 3,100 biotech startups, while the industry was able to raise a staggering amount of $34 billion globally. Additionally, according to EY, in 2021, the biotechnology industry's revenues were higher by 55% compared to 2016. However, much like other sectors, the biotech sector faced a slowdown in 2022 with low venture funding and a slowdown in number of IPOs as compared to 2021. Even the companies that did go public in 2022 ended up performing not particularly well, as reported by Crunchbase. However, in May 2022, McKinsey claimed that even after the downturn, the S&amp;P biotech index had delivered ten-year returns comparable to those of the S&amp;P 500 and higher than those of the S&amp;P pharmaceuticals index.Story continuesIn the agriculture sector, biotech aims to promote sustainable farming practices that also promise high yields.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We established a position in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and selling medicines for patients in the therapeutic areas of oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, and neurology. The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo.At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”11. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Net Income TTM: $ 6.55 billionFounded in 1980, Amgen Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”10.

Over the past year, we trimmed our position significantly as we believed the stock’s valuation failed to reflect the windfall nature of COVID-19 vaccine cash flows. With the stock nearly 70% off its highs and, more importantly, at a reasonable discount to our PMV estimate, we view the valuation as opportunistic given its long-term profit cycle potential. BioNTech’s intellectual property in mRNA, and COVID funded manufacturing capacity leave it well-positioned to develop new mRNA vaccines and cancer therapies. In addition, the company has non-mRNA technology (e.g., cell therapy assets) and blue-chip partnerships offering additional optionality. While the company’s R&amp;D pipeline beyond COVID-19 vaccines will take some time to mature, it is well funded by close to $20 billion in COVID-vaccine proceeds.

Earnings reports this week from Best Buy, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and others showed major improvement in inventory levels — setting the stage for better profit margins later in 2023 (provided the economy doesn't tank).Story continuesA few notable retailers this week that showed 4Q inventory declines year over year:Target: -3% (more on the quarter here from CFO Michael Fiddelke)Abercrombie &amp; Fitch: -4% (more on the quarter here from CEO Fran Horowitz)Best Buy: -14%Nordstrom: -15.2%Key quote on retailer inventory:“Everybody has a (fight) plan until they get punched in the face”. That is a quote attributed to former boxing champ Mike Tyson, which we believe is helpful to keep in mind as we assess retailers’ fight to get inventories clean. Now that we are 70% through the retail earnings season, it is a good time to check on the progress retailers/brands are making. The data are mixed, though we believe the news is more good than bad, as many retailers are making progress consistent with their plan of getting inventory growth more inline with sales growth. But given that sales growth is a moving target, Mike Tyson’s words of wisdom might suggest (which we believe is relevant to the current situation) ‘what if retailers get punched in the face with sales growth that is below forecast."" — Citi retail analyst Paul LejuezTesla Investor Day = Flop, Kind Of?The EV maker's hotly anticipated investor day left much to be desired, reports Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian.No introduction of a new $25,000 car.

There's the recent push into the space by CVS (CVS), with its $10.6 billion Oak Street Health acquisition, and Amazon (AMZN) acquiring One Health Medical for $3.9 billion. But all that activity is a reason to pause and reflect what kind of culture for-profit entities will bring to a medical service space.That's according to SCAN Health Group CEO Dr. Sachin Jain, who said the acquisitions could be an opportunity to connect existing health care verticals with the new clinical services. (See video above.)For example, CVS is not just a national drug chain anymore. It is also an insurance company and pharmacy benefits manager. That means it will want one part of its business to support the other, like finding a way to ""highlight"" Oak Street Health with its Aetna members, according to an executive on the latest earnings call.""I've just been around the block enough to know that, oftentimes, publicly traded entities don't necessarily understand clinical culture. They're making decisions, sometimes, for the short term,"" Jain said. ""When you're making decisions to hit a quarterly earnings target, you aren't necessarily doing the things you need to do to improve peoples' health over the long term.""It's why the deals could easily fall apart in the future. Or not. The jury is still out.""They're still figuring it out,"" Jain said.In addition to providing health care services, retail pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens (WBA) are looking to get into the drug trial space, but even that is a work in progress.Jain currently runs the California-based non-profit insurance company, but has held several positions in the past including in the U.S. Health Department, at Anthem (now Elevance Health (ELV)) and Merck (MRK). He is part of a segment of experts that worry about the impact of mergers and acquisitions by large for-profit entities in health care. Over the years, the cost of care has gone up as a result of such M&amp;A activity and an influx of private equity, according to studies.Story continuesIt's why, for now, traditional health care organizations are still the best bet. But that could change with the retail moves.""I worry that some of these entities will put profits before patients. I think the American public is tired of being seen as a profit center when it comes to their health and their wellness,"" Jain said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest trending stock tickers of the Yahoo Finance platformClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

Well, new data out from Citi today showing where exactly their card customers are spending this time around. Josh Schafer is here with a breakdown of what those numbers are. And Josh, what are we seeing?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, so let's take a look here. So Citi's data shows various sectors comparing February card spend this year to spend in that same month last year. Up first, the worst performer, household appliances-- spending down roughly 20%. Lowe's CEO Marvin Ellison noting in the company's earnings call, they're seeing similar trends as consumers are wary of a potential recession. Up next, you have electronics. This category down more than 8%, as consumers appear to be spending on more essential items like food at the grocery stores. Best Buy saying this week that despite a better than expected holiday quarter, they're, quote, ""preparing for another down year"" for the consumer electronics industry.And total retail also seeing a hit here in spending from Citi card users, down 6% on the year. Executives there have said it's a bit more of a picker's market, where companies are bouncing off loading inventories with too many promotions. And finally, let's end on a positive note, one of the few positive notes. Spending on pets remaining resilient, up 7 and 1/2% in February, up from last year, Dave. So I guess, maybe you can cut back on all this stuff. You still probably gotta feed your pet, though, right?DAVE BRIGGS: No question about it, man. I got that new farmer's market food for my dog-- loved it. Loved it. Super Bowl commercial, remember that?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, yeah. It got you on board. It worked.DAVE BRIGGS: So how's this playing for stocks in those sectors?Story continuesJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, so the spending doesn't always add up with what we see in stocks, right? So we said spending down in home appliances. You can see that sort of playing out with Lowe's here over the last month and Home Depot over the last month. But when you take a look at both of those companies on a year to date basis, not nearly as bad. Lowe's basically even year to date, and a little bit down for Home Depot, but not nearly down as bad as those sales numbers, those card numbers that we were looking at.And then interesting when you take a look at Best Buy and we talk about consumer electronics. And you take a look at Best Buy over the last month. So you can see Best Buy down about 7%, 8% here. I want to compare it to Walmart, another company that sells consumer electronics, but also is sort of buoyed by that groceries business we've been talking about. So you can see Walmart pretty much even over the last month and also about even year to date. So Walmart holding up a little bit better than Best Buy because they have a little bit more of a diversified business there.And finally, the pet stocks, the exciting stuff-- it's Friday. Let's take a look at Chewy. Chewy has had a decent little run year to date, up 8%. And then you take a look at Freshpet-- also up almost 20% year to date. So those pet stocks have been performing well at sort of matching the card data we're watching there with people spending at the pet companies, guys.DAVE BRIGGS: Love that stuff. Pet spending-- let's keep it up. We love our pets. Josh Schafer--JOSH SCHAFER: Gotta feed the dogs.DAVE BRIGGS: Gotta feed the dog. Thanks, buddy. Enjoy the weekend.]"

(NYSE:JWN) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.19 per share on the 29th of March. This means the annual payment is 3.8% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Nordstrom Nordstrom's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, Nordstrom's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 71.6%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 23% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.08 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.76. The dividend has shrunk at around 3.5% a year during that period. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.Dividend Growth Potential Is ShakyGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Nordstrom's earnings per share has shrunk at 10% a year over the past five years. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.In SummaryOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Earnings reports this week from Best Buy, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and others showed major improvement in inventory levels — setting the stage for better profit margins later in 2023 (provided the economy doesn't tank).Story continuesA few notable retailers this week that showed 4Q inventory declines year over year:Target: -3% (more on the quarter here from CFO Michael Fiddelke)Abercrombie &amp; Fitch: -4% (more on the quarter here from CEO Fran Horowitz)Best Buy: -14%Nordstrom: -15.2%Key quote on retailer inventory:“Everybody has a (fight) plan until they get punched in the face”. That is a quote attributed to former boxing champ Mike Tyson, which we believe is helpful to keep in mind as we assess retailers’ fight to get inventories clean. Now that we are 70% through the retail earnings season, it is a good time to check on the progress retailers/brands are making. The data are mixed, though we believe the news is more good than bad, as many retailers are making progress consistent with their plan of getting inventory growth more inline with sales growth. But given that sales growth is a moving target, Mike Tyson’s words of wisdom might suggest (which we believe is relevant to the current situation) ‘what if retailers get punched in the face with sales growth that is below forecast."" — Citi retail analyst Paul LejuezTesla Investor Day = Flop, Kind Of?The EV maker's hotly anticipated investor day left much to be desired, reports Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian.No introduction of a new $25,000 car. No super grand plans to crush surging EV entrants GM and Ford. Just a lot of droning on by the world's richest person, Elon Musk.Tesla shares finished the week down about 3% compared to a slight gain for the S&amp;P 500.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas — a long-time Tesla bull — did his best hype job post the company's investor day.""Tesla's audacious efforts on vertical integration are about to pay off. EVs are far too expensive today. Tesla gave a number of drivers for a 50% cost reduction for its next-gen platform.

JWN posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate, while sales missed both. Moreover, the top and bottom lines fell year over year.Results gained from strength in the core categories in the men's category during the quarter. However, the company has been witnessing decelerating demand trends since late June, inducing Nordstrom to right-size its inventory and expenses in response to the current macroeconomic environment. The company also announced plans to close its Canada business.Nordstrom posted adjusted earnings of 74 cents per share, down from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s $1.23. However, earnings per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents and our estimate of 64 cents.Total revenues of $4,319 million declined 4.1% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,327 million and our estimate of $4,321 million. The dismal revenues were the result of soft holiday sales trends due to high promotions. Reduced consumer spending amid lower income groups, stemming from the tough macroeconomic environment, hurt revenues across both banners. Gross merchandise value (GMV) declined 4.2% in the quarter.Shares of the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have lost 20.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 11%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Quarterly HighlightsNet sales fell 4.2% year over year to $4,200 million and lagged our estimate of $4,215.9 million. Credit Card net revenues grew 14.4% year over year to $119 million and beat our estimate of $105.3 million.In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, net sales for the Nordstrom banner decreased 2.4% from the year-ago quarter to $2,955 million but surpassed our estimate of $2,927.6 million. GMV declined 2.5% year over year for the Nordstrom banner in the fiscal fourth quarter.Sales at the Nordstrom Rack banner declined 8.1% year over year to $1,245 million and lagged our estimate of $1,288.3 million. This was mainly due to muted demand, particularly from lower-income customers. The elimination of store fulfillment for Nordstrom Rack digital orders starting from the fiscal third quarter hurt the fiscal fourth-quarter Rack banner net sales by 500 basis points (bps).Story continuesNordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNordstrom, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteDigital sales plunged 13.1% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter due to the elimination of store fulfillment for Nordstrom Rack digital orders in the fiscal third quarter and quitting of Trunk Club earlier in fiscal 2022. These actions hurt the fiscal fourth-quarter digital sales by 500 bps. In the fiscal fourth quarter, digital sales contributed 40% to net sales.Nordstrom's gross profit margin contracted 525 bps year over year to 33.2% for the reported quarter mainly due to higher markdowns. The increased markdowns were the result of the company’s actions to right-size inventory levels in a higher promotional environment.SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of sales, declined 240 bps to 31.5% due to supply-chain initiatives that helped deliver expense efficiencies and lower per-unit costs.Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $187 million declined 37.5% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter. The decline mainly resulted from higher markdowns, partly negated by supply-chain expense efficiencies. The EBIT margin declined 235 bps in the fiscal fourth quarter to 4.5%.Other FinancialsNordstrom ended fiscal 2022 with available liquidity of $1.5 billion, including $687 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $800 million available on its revolving credit facility. It had a leverage ratio of 3.1 times. The company had long-term debt (net of current liabilities) of $2,856 million and total shareholders’ equity of $739 million as of Jan 28, 2023.As of Jan 28, 2023, JWN’s net cash provided for operating activities was $946 million. The company spent $473 million toward capital expenditure in fiscal 2022.Nordstrom recently approved a dividend of 19 cents, payable Mar 14, to its shareholders of record as of Mar 29. In fiscal 2022, JWN bought back 2.8 million shares for $62 million as part of its $500-million share repurchase program. As of Jan 28, 2023, JWN has $438 million available under its share repurchase authorization.Closure of Canada OperationsNordstrom announced its intention to discontinue its Canada operations as part of its actions to drive long-term growth and enhance shareholder value. The company obtained an Initial Order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (""CCAA"") to facilitate the closure in an orderly fashion.Nordstrom Canada plans to close its Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack stores across Canada through a third-party liquidator. It also expects to wind down its Canada e-commerce platform. The e-commerce platform is expected to stop operations on Mar 2, 2023. The in-store closure is anticipated to be completed by late June 2023.Nordstrom Canada operates six Nordstrom stores and seven Nordstrom Rack stores, as well as the Nordstrom.ca website. It currently employs nearly 2,500 people.The company expects the Nordstrom Canada deconsolidation to reflect in its financial statements as of the date of the CCAA filing. It anticipates incurring $300-$350 million of pre-tax charges related to the wind-down in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 due to the write-down of the company's investment in Nordstrom Canada.The closure of the Canada business is likely to result in a $400-million decline in the company’s total revenues and a $35-million improvement in its EBIT in fiscal 2023 from that reported in fiscal 2022. This reflects the exclusion of the aforementioned charges associated with the wind-down.OutlookGoing forward, Nordstrom remains focused on enhancing customer experience, improving Nordstrom Rack performance, increasing inventory productivity and progressing on its supply-chain optimization initiatives. The company is confident of the strength of its brands, and its ability to drive profitable growth and deliver long-term value to shareholders.Management provided its outlook for fiscal 2023, including the 53rd week and the expected impact of the wind-down of Canada operations. JWN expects total revenues to decline 4-6% year over year in fiscal 2023. Revenues are expected to include a 250-bps impact of the closing of the Canada operations and a nearly 130-bps gain from the 53rd week.The EBIT margin is expected to be 1.2-2.1% of sales, including the impacts of the charges related to the closing of the Canada business. The adjusted EBIT margin is likely to be 3.7-4.2% of sales.The company predicts an income tax rate of 32% for fiscal 2023, including a 500-bps impact of the one-time charges for the Canada business wind-down. Adjusted earnings are envisioned to be $$1.80-$2.20 per share, excluding the charges related to the Canada business wind-down. Earnings per share, including the wind-down-related charges, are expected to be 20-80 cents. The company’s earnings guidance excludes any potential share repurchase.Stocks to ConsiderHere are three better-ranked stocks to consider, namely American Eagle Outfitters AEO, Tapestry TPR and Urban Outfitters URBN.American Eagle currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

After declining 7.7% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.Here is How to Spot Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why MMC Could Bounce Back Before LongThe RSI reading of 29.84 for MMC is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering MMC in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0.1% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, MMC currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

Shares have lost about 0.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MetLife due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.MetLife Q4 Earnings Miss on Lower Investment Income MetLife reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted operating earnings of $1.55 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 and our estimate of $1.77. The bottom line declined 29% year over year.Adjusted operating revenues of MetLife amounted to $15,836 million, which decreased 21.6% year over year. The top line missed the consensus mark of $16,996 million and our estimate of $16,303.1 million.The weak fourth-quarter results were caused by reduced private equity returns. Lower investment income affected important metrics despite a rising interest rate environment. Reduced profit levels from Asia and MetLife Holdings businesses were concerning. The negatives were partially offset by lower expenses, volume growth across some segments and improved contributions from the U.S. and Latin America businesses.2022 PerformanceMetLife generated adjusted operating revenues of $75.5 billion in 2022, up from $70.2 billion in 2021. Adjusted earnings per share of $6.85 fell 25% from the 2021 levels. Adjusted net investment income of $18.2 billion declined from $21.3 billion in 2021.Behind the HeadlinesAdjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding pension risk transfer (PRT), were $11,375 million, down 1% year over year. Adjusted net investment income fell 13% year over year to $4,530 million in the quarter under review, primarily due to reduced variable investment income stemming from decreased private equity returns.Total expenses of $14,589 million decreased from $18,783 million a year ago, due to lower policyholder benefits and claims. The adjusted expense ratio, excluding total notable items related to adjusted other expenses and PRT, increased 30 basis points (bps) year over year to 20.7%.Story continuesNet income increased 12% year over year to $1,314 million, due to net derivative and investment gains. Adjusted return on equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, deteriorated 400 bps year over year to 11.3%.Segmental PerformancesU.S.: The segment reported adjusted earnings of $771 million, which increased 20% year over year in the fourth quarter due to higher volume and favorable underwriting, partly offset by reduced variable investment income. Also, it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.9%. Adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding PRT of $6,735 million, rose 3% year over year.Asia: Adjusted earnings in the segment amounted to $215 million, which fell 63% year over year in the quarter under review and missed the consensus mark of $363.7 million, due to reduced variable investment income. Adjusted premiums, fees &amp; other revenues declined 12% year over year to $1,770 million in the fourth quarter.Latin America: Adjusted earnings of $181 million increased 45% from a year ago and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.1%, due to volume growth, favorable underwriting and increased investment margins, partially offset by reduced variable investment income. Adjusted premiums, fees &amp; other revenues advanced 20% on a cc basis year over year to $1,154 million in the segment, due to growing sales.EMEA: The segment’s adjusted earnings were $70 million, which surged 67% at reported basis and 112% at cc basis year over year in the fourth quarter, and beat the consensus mark by 16.1%. Favorable underwriting benefited the segment. Adjusted premiums, fees &amp; other revenues of $562 million declined 10% year over year.

Industry tax hikes have already ratcheted-up the level of fear and there are significant concerns Petro’s plan will not only shock Colombia’s petroleum-dependent economy but endanger the Andean country’s energy security and even spark a crisis. It is an ever-growing shortage of natural gas which will be the most likely trigger of an energy crisis, with declining domestic supply and rising demand already having forced Colombia to significantly increase liquified petroleum gas imports. The risks of such a crisis emerging are very real if Petro proceeds with his plan to cease issuing new oil exploration contracts.For roughly a decade, Colombia’s national government in the capital Bogota has been grappling with growing natural gas supply constraints at a time when demand for the fuel is rising rapidly. The dwindling natural gas supply can be primarily blamed on inadequate proven reserves, a lack of exploration and aging mature gas fields with rising decline rates. By the end of 2021, according to Colombia’s energy ministry, the country had only 3.1 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves, which at the current rate of production of around 1.1 million cubic feet daily, is only sufficient for another eight years. This points to current reserves being incapable of meeting domestic demand for natural gas in the near future. It is for this reason that Bogota started bulk imports of liquified petroleum gas in late-2017.The Santos and Duque administrations introduced policies aimed at garnering greater energy investment from foreign energy companies and stimulating hydrocarbon exploration. Those measures included introducing a well-head price for natural gas that was substantially higher than the international market rate and providing tax incentives for natural gas development. By 2021 demand for fossil fuel had grown so significantly that Colombia was planning to quadruple LPG imports during 2022. Even that has proven incapable of resolving Colombia’s natural gas supply crunch.Story continuesA pressing issue is that replacing Colombia’s aging gas fields and boosting the country’s meager reserves is proving highly problematic. There have been no major world-class hydrocarbon discoveries in Colombia for almost three decades, and despite 100 years of exploration, only four giant oil and gas fields have been discovered during that period. This indicates that Colombia does not possess the hydrocarbon potential that previous governments, the regulatory authority, the National Hydrocarbon Agency (ANH – Spanish initials) and the peak industry body, the Colombian Petroleum Association (ACP – Spanish initials) believe.Another complication is that much of the natural gas discovered and produced in Colombia is associated with gas which is contained in oil reservoirs and is a byproduct of petroleum extraction. Drillers in Colombia are utilizing nearly all the natural gas they produce for use in enhanced recovery techniques, notably gas injection. This is where the natural gas is injected into wells to elevate the reservoir pressure making it easier to extract the petroleum, thereby increasing the commercial life of the well. A lack of major oil discoveries and the fact that most producing oilfields are mature with aging wells means that there is a growing necessity to use gas injection to optimize petroleum extraction.Demand for dry gas is also high because petroleum industry participants use it as a fuel for the gas-fired plants which power their operations. This even includes national oil company Ecopetrol’s Cartagena and Barrancabermeja refineries. Gas condensate is also a crucial element used in Colombia’s petroleum production. It is employed as a necessary diluent that is added to the heavy crude oil, which comprises most of the petroleum produced in the Andean country, to make the bitumen-like oil flow so that it can be easily transported and process.There is also surging demand for natural gas from Colombian households and industry where it has become a key low-cost fuel used for a variety of purposes from heating and cooking to manufacturing applications. Gas-fired electricity generation is also becoming progressively more important in Colombia. A sharp decline in water levels due to an extended drought and the El Niño weather phenomena during 2015 and 2016 caused electricity output from Colombia’s hydroelectric plants to decline sharply. That placed considerable pressure on a national electric grid that was already plagued by inadequate infrastructure, faults and frequent outages. To ensure that adequate electricity is produced, Bogota implemented a strategy aimed at building gas-fired plants to provide additional electricity production during times hydroelectric output low. That placed greater pressure on already constrained natural gas supplies.Analysts fear if Petro proceeds with ending hydrocarbon exploration, then Colombia’s already meagre oil and natural gas reserves will rapidly dissipate, meaning the country will no longer be energy self-sufficient and face a potential crisis by as early as 2024. To assuage those fears Colombia’s president announced toward the end of 2022 that he had secure a deal through a privately held company for Venezuela’s national oil company PDVSA to export natural gas to Colombia. While aspects of the plan make sense, particularly with Venezuela possessing the world’s largest petroleum reserves, it is fraught with considerable risk and may not be a viable solution. Petro’s plan to cease awarding hydrocarbon exploration contracts will exacerbate Colombia’s existing natural gas shortage, potentially roil the oil dependent economy and trigger an energy crisis.By Matthew Smith for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Coal May Be Dying, But America Still Needs Oil And GasHow Russia's War On Ukraine Is Altering Global Crude Oil TradeChronic Shortages Push Uzbekistan Towards Russian Natural GasRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

The oil and gas sector is responsible for producing, exploring, transporting, and refining crude oil and natural gas. Various types of jobs are available in the oil industry, each requiring different levels of experience and education.In this article, we will delve deeper into some of the most common types of jobs in the red-hot oil industry, what they involve, and why they are essential.1. GeologistsGeologists play a crucial role in the oil industry by identifying potential areas for drilling and exploration. They analyze geological data to determine whether an area can potentially contain oil or gas deposits. A geologist's work involves mapping out rock formations using sophisticated technology such as seismic imaging to identify where natural resources may be located. In fact, geologists played a crucial role in the shale boom by using advanced technology and techniques to locate and extract oil and gas from previously inaccessible shale formations.Education Required: A Bachelor's degree in geology or a related field is required, while a Master's degree is often preferred.Experience Required: Entry-level positions may require little to no experience, but senior-level positions may require several years of experience.Some of their key responsibilities include:Identifying potential drilling sitesAnalyzing geological dataMapping rock formationsCollaborating with other professionals such as engineersPreparing reports on findings2. Drilling EngineersDrilling engineers design and oversee the drilling process for oil wells. They work to ensure that drilling operations are conducted safely and efficiently. Drilling engineers play a critical role in designing efficient systems that can extract as much crude oil as possible from underground reserves while minimizing environmental impact.Story continuesEducation Required: A Bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering or a related field is required while a Master's degree can be beneficial for career advancement.Experience Required: Entry-level positions may require little to no experience, but senior-level positions may require several years of experience.Some of their key responsibilities include:Designing drilling plansOverseeing drilling operationsEnsuring safety protocols are followedAnalyzing data collected during drilling operations3.

As recently as last year, Tashkent earned money selling gas to China, but an Uztransgaz representative was compelled to admit in December that all exports had been halted as public anger mounted over a nationwide wave of power outages.Russia, which has rendered itself an international pariah by invading Ukraine, spotted an opportunity in the crisis. In late November, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly spoke during a meeting in Moscow with Kazakhstan’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev about the notion of setting up a “trilateral [gas trading] union” that would also comprise Uzbekistan.The initial Uzbek reaction was circumspect. Energy Minister Jorabek Mirzamahmudov was cited by Reuters news agency as saying that Tashkent had not been consulted on the issue, but that if any gas agreement was signed, it would be a purely technical and financial transaction. Not political in other words.And then, in late January, Uzbekistan reached an agreement with Russia to explore the possibility of reversing the flow of gas in the Central Asia-Center pipeline to send supplies south instead of north.An energy official in Tashkent told AFP news agency that deliveries might start as soon as March 1, although that deadline has now come and gone. No public statement has been made on when the first gas will be pumped to Uzbekistan. No information has been divulged either on how much Russia intends to supply and what the terms of sale are.Story continuesKazakhstan is likewise poised to start sourcing some of its gas needs from Russia. Like Uzbekistan, it too has had to forego China-bound exports.“Taking the growth in gas consumption within Kazakhstan into account, QazaqGaz cannot count on exports in the next fall-winter period,” the deputy chairman of Kazakhstan’s state-owned natural gas company, Arman Kasenov said on February 24.Earlier that same week, Kazakh Energy Minister Bolat Akchulakov said at a government meeting that plans are being drawn up to import gas from Russia to provide for areas in the east of Kazakhstan.The infrastructure for those specific imports does not yet exist, however. Extending gas supplies to those regions of Kazakhstan will be contingent on completion of a transnational pipeline running from Russia to China.By Eurasianet.orgMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Shell Is Reviewing Its Plan To Reduce Oil Production This DecadeCoal May Be Dying, But America Still Needs Oil And GasHow Russia's War On Ukraine Is Altering Global Crude Oil TradeRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

(NYSE:OMC) Stock Goes Ex-Dividend In Just Four Days,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/omnicom-group-inc-nyse-omc-122201706.html,1677932521,STORY,['OMC'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Omnicom Group's shares before the 9th of March in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 6th of April.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.70 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.80 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Omnicom Group has a trailing yield of 3.1% on the current share price of $91.7. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Omnicom Group Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Omnicom Group paying out a modest 44% of its earnings. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out more than half (69%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Omnicom Group, with earnings per share up 6.8% on average over the last five years. Decent historical earnings per share growth suggests Omnicom Group has been effectively growing value for shareholders. However, it's now paying out more than half its earnings as dividends. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Omnicom Group has delivered 8.8% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayIs Omnicom Group an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share have been growing at a steady rate, and Omnicom Group paid out less than half its profits and more than half its free cash flow as dividends over the last year. Overall we're not hugely bearish on the stock, but there are likely better dividend investments out there.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Omnicom Group you should know about.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Earnings reports this week from Best Buy, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and others showed major improvement in inventory levels — setting the stage for better profit margins later in 2023 (provided the economy doesn't tank).Story continuesA few notable retailers this week that showed 4Q inventory declines year over year:Target: -3% (more on the quarter here from CFO Michael Fiddelke)Abercrombie &amp; Fitch: -4% (more on the quarter here from CEO Fran Horowitz)Best Buy: -14%Nordstrom: -15.2%Key quote on retailer inventory:“Everybody has a (fight) plan until they get punched in the face”. That is a quote attributed to former boxing champ Mike Tyson, which we believe is helpful to keep in mind as we assess retailers’ fight to get inventories clean. Now that we are 70% through the retail earnings season, it is a good time to check on the progress retailers/brands are making. The data are mixed, though we believe the news is more good than bad, as many retailers are making progress consistent with their plan of getting inventory growth more inline with sales growth. But given that sales growth is a moving target, Mike Tyson’s words of wisdom might suggest (which we believe is relevant to the current situation) ‘what if retailers get punched in the face with sales growth that is below forecast."" — Citi retail analyst Paul LejuezTesla Investor Day = Flop, Kind Of?The EV maker's hotly anticipated investor day left much to be desired, reports Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian.No introduction of a new $25,000 car. No super grand plans to crush surging EV entrants GM and Ford. Just a lot of droning on by the world's richest person, Elon Musk.Tesla shares finished the week down about 3% compared to a slight gain for the S&amp;P 500.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas — a long-time Tesla bull — did his best hype job post the company's investor day.""Tesla's audacious efforts on vertical integration are about to pay off. EVs are far too expensive today. Tesla gave a number of drivers for a 50% cost reduction for its next-gen platform. In a race to the bottom, we seriously question how the competition can keep up,"" Jonas crowed.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The customer relationship managment software company beat Q4 earnings expectations by 24% with EPS of $1.68, and beat top-line estimates by 5% with sales at $8.38 billion. Year over year, Q4 earnings were up 100% with sales rising 14% from the prior-year quarter.Salesforce very much appeased Wall Street and investors alike by also offering better-than-expected profit guidance. CEO and co-founder Marc Benioff also highlighted that salesforce closed its fiscal year 2023 with operating cash flow at $7.1 billion, up 19% YoY and its highest cash flow in company history. This led to Salesforce also announcing a new $20 billion stock buyback plan.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKroger Q4 ReviewPivoting to Kroger’s Q4 report, the retail grocery chain operator beat bottom-line expectations by 10% on Thursday with earnings of $0.99 per share. Fourth-quarter sales slightly topped estimates at $34.78 billion. Year over year, Q4 EPS was up 9% with sales rising 5% from the prior-year quarter.During the quarterly release, a few of the highlights were Identical sales without fuel increasing 6% with digital sales growing 12%. Overall, Kroger’s adjusted EPS grew 15% in 2022 with an operating profit of $4.1 billion and total identical sales without fuel up 5.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance &amp; ValuationSalesforce stock ended yesterday’s trading session up 11% with Kroger shares 5% higher. Year to date Salesforce stock has climbed 41% to outperform Kroger’s +2%, the S&amp;P 500’s +4%, and the Nasdaq’s +9%. However, over the last three years, Kroger’s +48% has topped Salesforce’s +6% and the broader indexes.  Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBoth stocks may have more upside based on their historical valuation and Kroger especially stands out with KR stock landing an “A” Style Scores grade for Value.Kroger trades at just 10.8X forward earnings which is nicely below its industry average of 12.7X. Kroger also trades 45% beneath its decade high of 19.6X and at a 17% discount to the median of 13.1X. Notably, Kroger shares trade below the S&amp;P 500’s 17.9X forward earnings as well.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn comparison, Salesforce’s P/E valuation is above the benchmark at 31.8X forward earnings but is very attractive relative to its past. While Salesforce also trades higher than the industry average of 27.1X it does trade well below its extreme decade-long high and 78% beneath the median of 144.1X.Furthermore, when taking their growth rate into account we can see that both Salesforce and Kroger’s PEG ratios are not very far above the optimum level of 1.0 at 1.87 and 1.77, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth OutlookAfter rounding out its fiscal 2023, Salesforce earnings are expected to jump 11% in FY24 and climb another 20% in FY25 at $7.04 per share. Earnings estimate revisions have already gone up after the company’s strong Q4 report and this could certainly continue.On the top line, sales are forecasted to be up 10% for FY24 and rise another 11% in FY25 to $38.33 billion. Impressively, fiscal 2025 would be a very stellar 212% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $12.28 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTurning to Kroger, earnings are forecasted to be virtually flat for FY24 and rise 2% in FY25 at $4.30 per share. Kroger’s earnings estimates are also trending higher following its strong Q4 report and upbeat guidance.Kroger’s sales are now projected to be up 3% in FY24 and rise another 1% in FY25 to $154.33 billion. More importantly, fiscal 2025 sales would be 27% above pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $121.16 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineSalesforce (CRM) and Kroger (KR) are two trending stocks right now and they certainly look attractive following their strong Q4 reports.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Sealed Air's shares before the 9th of March in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 24th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.20 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.80 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Sealed Air has a trailing yield of 1.6% on the current stock price of $49.12. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for Sealed Air Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Sealed Air has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 24% of its income after tax. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 32% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's positive to see that Sealed Air's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see Sealed Air has grown its earnings rapidly, up 62% a year for the past five years. Sealed Air is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Sealed Air has lifted its dividend by approximately 4.4% a year on average. Earnings per share have been growing much quicker than dividends, potentially because Sealed Air is keeping back more of its profits to grow the business.To Sum It UpHas Sealed Air got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Sealed Air has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. Sealed Air looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.While it's tempting to invest in Sealed Air for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Our analysis shows 1 warning sign for Sealed Air and you should be aware of this before buying any shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Both Ralph Lauren and LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA have a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.RL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.59, while LVMUY has a forward P/E of 24.31. We also note that RL has a PEG ratio of 1.57. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. LVMUY currently has a PEG ratio of 1.73.Another notable valuation metric for RL is its P/B ratio of 3.17. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, LVMUY has a P/B of 7.47.Based on these metrics and many more, RL holds a Value grade of B, while LVMUY has a Value grade of F.Story continuesBoth RL and LVMUY are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that RL is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Large-Cap Stocks Hedge Funds Are Dumping.We are now approaching the end of the first quarter of 2023 and the markets are exhibiting an upward trend. As of March 3, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 5.58% year to date and the Nasdaq has shot up by 12.40% since the beginning of the year. After the disastrous year that 2022 was for the stock market, seeing these upward moves can make one wonder whether these moves are just short-term spikes or if they are the real deal.Morgan Stanley's Senior Vice President: ""We Think The Bear Market Is Not Over""On February 27 Morgan Stanley's senior vice president and portfolio manager, Katerina Simonetti, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance Live where she discussed her view of the markets and what she sees moving forward. Simonetti noted that 2022 was centered around ""inflation and Fed action, and markets ""underestimated inflation"" so ""now we're seeing the results of that"". Simonetti further spoke about the Fed's hiking cycle and said that since ""economic data surprised us to the positive"", the central bank is expected to continue its hiking cycle. Here are some comments from Katerina Simonetti of Morgan Stanley:""As we continue to focus on the Fed, in our view, the focus should be on the earnings revisions. Because that's where the real story for '23, in our view, is the fact that it was easier to be profitable during the times of the high inflation and as inflation is coming down, these profit margins are harder to find.""Simonetti noted that U.S. companies ""specifically are going to be revising their earnings and setting them to the more normal level"". The earnings revisions ""to the more normal level"" are going to be ""viewed by the market as a negative, as it should be"" said Simonetti, and ""this is what is really underestimated by the general investing public"". Simonetti thinks that ""there is a lot of risk in this market, and that the risk-reward is just not there"". Katerina Simonetti said that ""earnings have a long way to go"" and ""stocks seem highly overvalued"". Simonetti further said that ""another leg down"" is necessary ""to pivot our way into the next bull market"" since ""the bear market is not over"".Story continuesKaterina Simonetti said she does not think that ""there are not opportunities in this market"". Simonetti likes ""high-quality dividend-paying stocks"" in the healthcare, financials, and utilities sectors and more specifically, she likes the ""combination of blue-chip dividend-paying stocks plus higher-yielding bonds"" in the current market environment. Finally, Simonetti said that though technology outperformed all other sectors in the last bull market, she thinks ""this might not be the leading sector in the next bull market"".Hedge funds are some of the biggest players in the stock market, with their decisions potentially having a large impact on the market. It can be especially insightful to look where smart money is placing its bets. However, looking at stocks that hedge funds are dumping can potentially save retail investors from short-term volatility and potential losses.

We narrowed down our selection to the 15 largest stocks with the most negative hedge fund sentiment on the margin. We have ranked these stocks, primarily by the number of hedge funds that sold their positions in the company in Q4 2022.

Recently, the company expanded through the acquisition of Allergan, which added robust growth assets to help offset the loss of U.S. patent protection for Humira, a leading treatment used for rheumatology, dermatology. gastroenterology, and ophthalmology. While AbbVie reported weak third quarter revenues across the board, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vraylar (an antipsychotic treatment) in December. Despite concerns around Humira’s loss of patent protection, we believe AbbVie has significantly diversified its revenue and that its launch of Rinvog for psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis could be promising.”11.

We sold our position at that time due to heightened risk associated with operations in Kazakhstan, which sends oil through a pipeline that runs through Russia out to the Black Sea. When Russia invaded Ukraine, we believed there was real risk that something would happen to inhibit Chevron’s ability to get that oil to the market. We didn’t believe that risk was reflected in the stock price, so we sold our position. Today, 10+ months into the Ukraine crisis, more information has become available regarding the Kazakhstan operations, and the associated risks are now well-known. We believe those risks are fully priced into the current stock valuation. Chevron is one of the best operators in its field, with a diversified portfolio and strong management, and we took the opportunity to reinvest when the stock was trading below our estimate of intrinsic value.”8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 100Number of Hedge Funds That Sold: 10In Q4 2022, 10 hedge funds dissolved their positions in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM).

(NYSE:JPM)  is negative and the stock is among the top large-cap stocks hedge funds dumped in Q4 2022.This January, Deutsche Bank analyst Matt O'Connor downgraded JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) to Hold from Buy and lowered his price target on the shares to $145 from $155.As of December 31, Greenhaven Associates is the leading shareholder in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) and has a position worth $643.1 million in the company.Here is what Vltava Fund had to say about JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term.JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008.A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.”7. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 259Number of Hedge Funds That Sold: 10On February 24, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives raised his price target on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to $290 from $280 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares.

Azure now represents nearly 25% of the total business and continues to compound at a higher rate. Although growth is moderating a bit recently (as it is for AWS and Google Cloud Platform as well), these three platforms collectively generated more than $140 billion in revenue during the last 12 months and are still growing at a healthy rate. Further, Microsoft Cloud, or commercial cloud (which includes Azure and other cloud services, Office 365 Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties) continues to grow roughly 30% and is now about half the business. Mathematically, commercial cloud could decelerate to 20% growth with all other segments decelerating to zero growth and total company revenue growth would still be at least double digits. We believe Microsoft is positioned to compound underlying earnings per share at a midteens rate over the next five years. At 22x earnings, we felt the valuation was attractive and that it should be a large position.”6. NextEra Energy, Inc.

With Microsoft’s ChatGPT-powered Bing making waves and Google’s answer to it, Bard, suffering a “demoralizing” demo last month, workers want to know the game plan with artificial intelligence and search.More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeHow to save $750 a month, according to financial advisersThe 10 best high yield savings accounts for March 2023This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 homeAt an all-hands meeting Thursday, Google workers had the chance to pepper CEO Sundar Pichai and Bard product lead Jack Krawczyk with questions, according to CNBC, which said it obtained audio of the meeting.One worker asked the following question via Google’s internal forum Dory, according to CNBC:“Bard and ChatGPT are large language models, not knowledge models. They are great at generating human-sounding text, they are not good at ensuring their text is fact-based. Why do we think the big first application should be Search, which at its heart is about finding true information?”Krawczyk, making his all-hands debut, quickly responded, “I just want to be very clear: Bard is not search.”Instead, he said, it’s “a collaborative A.I. service.”“The magic that we’re finding in using the product is really around being this creative companion to helping you be the spark plug for imagination, explore your curiosity, etc.,” he said. But, he added, “We can’t stop users from trying to use it like search.”Of course, search is very much on the minds of Google investors and employees. When OpenAI shared its A.I. chatbot ChatGPT with the public in late November, thoughts immediately turned to how the technology might disrupt Google’s search dominance.Fears about that were hardly allayed when Microsoft launched a ChatGPT-powered rival to Google search last month. (It’s available to a limited number of users for now but will be more widely available soon.)Story continuesGoogle responded last month with a video of a demo of Bard, but that was botched by a factual error from the chatbot concerning the James Webb Space Telescope. Wall Street promptly punished Google parent Alphabet, sending its shares down sharply.Another question on Thursday was about the demo, according to CNBC, with an employee asking, “The first public demo was demoralizing, sent our stock into a nosedive, and invited massive media coverage. What really happened?”“Questions like this can be fair and we want to reiterate the fact that Bard has not launched,” Krawczyk replied. “We acknowledged to the world that this is something that we’re experimenting with—we’re testing it. But there’s a lot of excitement in the industry right now.”Another worker reportedly commented, “Launching AI seems like a knee-jerk reaction without a strategy.”“I disagree with the premise of this question” Pichai responded, noting Google has been “working on A.I. for a long time.”Indeed, OpenAI was established in 2015 “as a counterweight to Google” in A.I., Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who helped start it, tweeted last month. He also complained that OpenAI had “become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft.” (Musk is now reportedly working to establish a rival to OpenAI.)But Google, though it’s long been strong on the A.I. research front, has much more to lose than anyone else if users start Googling less and turning to A.I. chatbots more for their search queries.Google declined to comment when contacted by Fortune.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeHow to save $750 a month, according to financial advisersThe 10 best high yield savings accounts for March 2023This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

Microsoft has invested billions into Open A.I., the company that created ChatGPT, and plans to incorporate the technology into its Bing search engine. And the chatbot’s debut forced Google, which has been researching A.I. for years, to jump into the game and rush to market with its own A.I. product, Bard. After decades of search dominance, the rapid developments have left Google playing defense. The company asked its A.I. teams last month to “prioritize working on a response to ChatGPT.” And the urgency for Google to up its game made some staffers lash out about the “rushed” and “botched” announcement of its own chatbot now in beta testing.In the latest glimpse of the pressure Google is under, newly leaked audio obtained by Insider reveals the company’s Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian hitting back at critics in a company town hall last month, and saying that the battle for A.I. dominance was only just beginning.“There are other companies taking shots at us saying that we are late to market. We've missed the A.I. boat,” Kurian said in the recording. “I would tell you this is the very first minute of a new game, and the game is never done in the first minute.”Kurian further called on employees to work together, and hyped up the workers laboring over the company’s A.I. plans.“We are committed as an organization to providing the best capability in these markets, and I can promise you that our engineers are going to deliver amazing technology in A.I. to our customers,” Kurian said. Google did not immediately return Fortune’s request for comment.The company is navigating intense pressure and high stakes in the A.I. race. Bing, which only controls a fraction of the search market, has much to gain from a successful A.I. search product, while Google has everything to lose. “We believe that Microsoft is aiming not only to lower Google’s search margins, but also to dissuade Alphabet from running Google Cloud and other businesses at a loss,” an ARK Invest analyst wrote in a note earlier this month.While OpenAI is considered a small company that is more able to take risks—like releasing a chatbot to the internet at large—Google must weigh concerns about its reputation and how problematic A.I. released to the public could do damage to the company. Its new chatbot, Bard, is currently only available to a limited group of “trusted testers.” And even though Google did take a leap with Bard, the chatbot infamously gave incorrect answers during a videotaped demo announcing the product earlier this month, resulting in a $100 billion wipeout of market value from the California-based tech giant.Story continuesMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeHow to save $750 a month, according to financial advisersThe 10 best high yield savings accounts for March 2023This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 homeThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeHow to save $750 a month, according to financial advisersThe 10 best high yield savings accounts for March 2023This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

That means it will want one part of its business to support the other, like finding a way to ""highlight"" Oak Street Health with its Aetna members, according to an executive on the latest earnings call.""I've just been around the block enough to know that, oftentimes, publicly traded entities don't necessarily understand clinical culture. They're making decisions, sometimes, for the short term,"" Jain said. ""When you're making decisions to hit a quarterly earnings target, you aren't necessarily doing the things you need to do to improve peoples' health over the long term.""It's why the deals could easily fall apart in the future. Or not. The jury is still out.""They're still figuring it out,"" Jain said.In addition to providing health care services, retail pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens (WBA) are looking to get into the drug trial space, but even that is a work in progress.Jain currently runs the California-based non-profit insurance company, but has held several positions in the past including in the U.S. Health Department, at Anthem (now Elevance Health (ELV)) and Merck (MRK). He is part of a segment of experts that worry about the impact of mergers and acquisitions by large for-profit entities in health care. Over the years, the cost of care has gone up as a result of such M&amp;A activity and an influx of private equity, according to studies.Story continuesIt's why, for now, traditional health care organizations are still the best bet. But that could change with the retail moves.""I worry that some of these entities will put profits before patients. I think the American public is tired of being seen as a profit center when it comes to their health and their wellness,"" Jain said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest trending stock tickers of the Yahoo Finance platformClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

66,ba4f5244-4603-3f59-b6a4-9a02dc410225,WBA,2023-03-04,The implications of Walgreens' decision on abortion pills,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/implications-walgreens-decision-abortion-pills-195109495.html,1677873069.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[Walgreens says it will not start selling an abortion pill in 20 states that had warned of legal consequences if it did so.The drugstore chain’s announcement Thursday signals that access to mifepristone may not expand as broadly as federal regulators intended in January, when they finalized a rule change allowing more pharmacies to provide the pill.Here’s a closer look at the issue.ABOUT THE ABORTION PILLThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone in 2000 to end pregnancy, when used in combination with a second drug, misoprostol. The combination is approved for use up to the 10th week of pregnancy.Mifepristone is taken first to dilate the cervix and block a hormone needed to sustain a pregnancy. Misoprostol is taken a day or two later, causing contractions to empty the uterus.More than half of U.S. abortions are now done with pills rather than with a procedure, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. In rare cases, the drug combination can cause excess bleeding, requiring emergency care.WIDENING ACCESSFor more than 20 years, the FDA limited dispensing of mifepristone to a subset of specialty offices and clinics due to safety concerns.The agency has repeatedly eased restrictions and expanded access, increasing demand even as state laws make the pills harder to get for many women.In late 2021, the agency eliminated an in-person requirement for getting the pill, saying a new scientific review showed no increase in safety complications if the drug is taken at home. That change also permitted the pill to be prescribed via telehealth and shipped by mail-order pharmacies.Earlier this year, the FDA further loosened restrictions by allowing pharmacies like Walgreens to start dispensing the drug after they undergo certification. That includes meeting standards for shipping, tracking and confidentially storing prescribing information.STATES STEP INTypically, the FDA’s authority to regulate prescription drug access has gone unchallenged. But more than a dozen states now have laws restricting abortion broadly — and the pills specifically — following last year’s Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion.Story continuesLast month, attorneys general in 20 conservative-led states warned CVS and Walgreens in a letter that they could face legal consequences if they sell abortion pills by mail in their states.In addition to state laws, attorneys general from conservative states have argued that shipments of mifepristone run afoul of a 19th century law that prohibited sending items used in abortion through the mail.WALGREENS' REACTIONA spokesman says the company told the attorneys general that it will not dispense mifepristone in their states and it doesn't plan to ship the drug to them as well.But Walgreens is working to become eligible through the FDA’s certification process. It plans to dispense the pills where it can legally do so.The company is not currently dispensing the pills anywhere.OTHER DRUGSTORESRite Aid Corp. said it was “monitoring the latest federal, state, legal and regulatory developments” and would keep evaluating its policies. The Associated Press also sought comment from CVS Health Corp., retail giant Walmart and the grocery chain Kroger.Some independent pharmacists would like to become certified to dispense the pills, said Andrea Pivarunas, a spokeswoman for the National Community Pharmacists Association. She added that this would be a “personal business decision,"" based partly on state laws. The association has no specifics on how many will do it.OTHER LEGAL ISSUESIn November, an anti-abortion group filed a federal lawsuit in Texas seeking to revoke mifepristone's approval, claiming the FDA approved the drug 23 years ago without adequate evidence of safety.A federal judge could rule soon. If he sides with abortion opponents, mifepristone could potentially be removed from the U.S. market.In January, abortion rights supporters filed separate lawsuits challenging abortion pill restrictions imposed in North Carolina and West Virginia.Legal experts foresee years of court battles over access to the pills.___AP Health Writer Matthew Perrone contributed to this story.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

For example, Kansas' law that patients only obtain the pills directly from a physician is blocked in court.The latest decision demonstrates how widely abortion access can vary from state to state in a post-Roe America, even in places where no bans are in effect — as elected officials tussle with the federal government, activists, and corporations to block the availability of services.Price Action: WBA shares closed at $35.38 on Thursday.Photo via Wikimedia CommonsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Cap Gemini SA and Paychex are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CGEMY likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than PAYX has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.CGEMY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.87, while PAYX has a forward P/E of 26.36. We also note that CGEMY has a PEG ratio of 1.81. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. PAYX currently has a PEG ratio of 3.51.Another notable valuation metric for CGEMY is its P/B ratio of 3.26. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, PAYX has a P/B of 12.61.These metrics, and several others, help CGEMY earn a Value grade of B, while PAYX has been given a Value grade of D.CGEMY stands above PAYX thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that CGEMY is the superior value option right now.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Strong momentum across electric vehicle space on the back of its robust Battery Management System solutions is a positive.Increasing power design wins are other positives. Solid momentum of HEV platform across cabin electronics ecosystem is a tailwind. The company also remains optimistic about the growth prospects related to 5G. Considering the abovementioned factors, we expect first-quarter fiscal 2023 total revenue to rise 15.3% year over year.However, weak momentum across major applications and leveraged balance sheet are concerns.

Its pooled employer plan has reached the milestone of $1 billion in U.S. assets and commitments.The company engages in prudent capital deployment. It had around $6.7 billion fund left under its share buyback program as of Sep 30, 2022. However, elevated operating costs can put pressure on margins.

Solid footing across multiple industries like general industry, aviation and solar also bode well for the segment. Sales growth of lubrication equipment, process pumps and semiconductor pumps, and heaters and fittings are benefiting the Process segment. New product launches and channel expansion initiatives are also aiding the segment.Graco’s policy of investing in product innovation and capacity expansion should fuel its growth.

74,f9f12944-f245-3ab6-9396-0fae6640e92b,XEL,2023-03-04,The 7 Best Utility Stocks to Buy as Yields Rise,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-utility-stocks-buy-201613035.html,1677615373,STORY,"['WTRG', 'AWK', 'EXCVV', 'WEC', 'XEL', 'SO']","[With monetary policy possibly about to take a turn for the worst for risk-on assets, investors should consider the best utility stocks to buy. Unfortunately for Wall Street, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index came in hotter than economists anticipated. In turn, this dynamic suggests that the Federal Reserve may raise the benchmark interest rate to combat stubbornly high inflation.Fundamentally, the best utility stocks to buy shield investors from significant volatility because of their underlying natural monopoly. According to Investopedia, “[a] natural monopoly is a type of monopoly that exists typically due to the high start-up costs or powerful economies of scale of conducting a business in a specific industry which can result in significant barriers to entry for potential competitors.”What makes the below names of the best utility stocks to buy stand out is that they enjoy a combination of relatively strong upside price targets with passive income. Now, the degree to which investors receive either attribute will vary. However, I provided a diversity of ideas so that you can pick what works best for your portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSOSouthern Co.$63.55EXCExelon Corp.$40.72XELXcel Energy$64.72WECWEC Energy$89.24AWKAmerican Water Works$140.61WTRGEssential Utilities$42.90CEGConstellation Energy$74.95Southern Co. (SO)the southern company logo displayed several times on a screenSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Southern Co. (NYSE:SO) is a gas and electric utility holding company. Per its public profile, it’s the second-largest utility in terms of the customer base as of 2021. Through its subsidiaries, it serves nine million gas and electric utility customers in six states. In the trailing year, SO stock slipped 0.32%.For passive income, Southern features a robust forward yield of 4.29%. This hits higher than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. As well, the company commands 21 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Certainly, this will be a status that management will want to keep going.Story continuesAccording to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), SO rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, the company features solid operational attributes. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 10%, above 66.3% of the competition. Also, its net margin is 12.08%, also above 66% of the field. Currently, Wall Street analysts peg SO as a consensus hold. However, their average price target ($70.40) implies 9% upside potential. Thus, SO makes for a balanced example of the best utility stocks to buy.Exelon (EXC)The logo for Exelon (EXC) is visible at the top of an office building.Source: photosounds / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) is the largest electric parent company in the U.S., per its public profile. Presently, it features approximately 10 million regulated electric utility customers. Since the January opener, EXC slipped over 4%. In the trailing year, shares gave up nearly 3% of equity value.On the passive income front, Exelon offers a decent showing, posting a forward yield of 3.48%. Although it’s a bit below the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%, the company features a payout ratio of 57.45%. That affords the yield a bit more confidence and credibility. To be fair, though, Exelon only features one year of dividend increases. As for its financials, Exelon is currently working through the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. However, it did manage to post a trailing-year net margin of 11.37%. This stat ranks above 62.53% of the competition.Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg EXC as a consensus moderate buy. In addition,  their average price target stands at $46.30, implying 12% upside potential. Thus, it makes a solid case for the best utility stocks to buy.Xcel Energy (XEL)close-up of Xcel Energy (XCEL) logo in black and red displayed on smartphone screenSource: shutterstock.com/rafapressBased in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) is a regulated electric utility and natural gas delivery firm. Per its corporate profile, the company serves more than 3.7 million electric customers and 2.1 million natural gas customers across parts of eight states. Since the Jan. opener, XEL declined by 6%. In the trailing year, it’s underwater to the tune of 2%.Still, XEL might be a solid discount among the best utility stocks to buy. For passive income, the company carries a forward yield of 3.16%. While it’s a bit under the sector average, Xcel commands 20 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. As well, its payout ratio of 57.6% is relatively manageable.Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculations, XEL rates as modestly undervalued. As well, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 8.1%, above 60.75% of the competition. Also, its net margin pings at 11.34%, outpacing 62% of its peers. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg XEL as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $73.75, implying 12% upside potential. Thus, it’s well worth considering the best utility stocks to buy.WEC Energy (WEC)WEC Energy Group logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comCalling Milwaukee, Wisconsin home, WEC Energy (NYSE:WEC) is a leading Midwest electric and natural gas holding company with subsidiaries serving 4.6 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota. Since the January opener, WEC gave up over 3% of its equity value. However, in the trailing year, it managed to poke its head barely above breakeven.Still, with investor fears rising about the Fed’s future monetary policy strategy, WEC may rank among the best utility stocks to buy. For passive income, the company carries a forward yield of 3.43%. That’s almost in line with the sector’s average yield. As well, it’s on a 19-year streak regarding consecutive annual dividend increases. So close to 20 years, management won’t give up this payout without a fight.According to Gurufocus.com, WEC rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, the utility features a three-year revenue growth rate of 8.5%, outpacing 62.53% of the field. Its net margin almost touches 15%, which beats out 75% of its rivals. Finally, covering analysts peg WEC as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $102.40, implying 12.5% upside potential. Therefore, it’s another balanced example of the best utility stocks to buy.American Water Works (AWK)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comA public utility firm, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) provides water and wastewater services in the U.S. Per its public profile, the company provides these services to approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states. It serves a total of approximately 14 million customers. Since the Jan. opener, AWK fell more than 8%, indicating a higher risk profile. For the trailing year, it’s down 6.3%.Objectively, AWK may require patience. For instance, it trades at a trailing multiple of 31.39, which ranks on the high side. Further, the relevance of its water business should keep the machinery going. As evidence, its net margin stands at 21.62%, outpacing 87.58% of the competition. In terms of passive income, AWK sits a bit on the modest side, with a forward yield of 1.85%. However, the company enjoys 13 years of consecutive dividend increases. In addition, its payout ratio of 50.93% indicates confidence in its sustainability.Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg AWK as a consensus hold. However, their average price target stands at $162.20, implying almost 15% upside potential. Thus, it can make up ground in the capital gains department, making it one of the best utility stocks to buy for rising rates.Essential Utilities (WTRG)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA utility firm with stakes in Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia, Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) provides drinking water and wastewater treatment infrastructure and services. As with American Water Works, Essential Utilities features a higher-risk profile. Since the beginning of Jan., WTRG slipped nearly 8%. For the trailing year, it’s down almost 6%.Still, contrarian investors may consider WTRG as one of the best utility stocks to buy for rising rates. Per Gurufocus.com, WTRG rates as modestly undervalued. Operationally, the company really comes to life. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 15.7%, ranking better than 80.49% of the field. On the bottom line, its net margin stands at 22.04%, outpacing over 88% of sector rivals.Regarding passive income, WTRG doesn’t provide the most generous rate with a forward yield of 2.59%. Still, it’s something. As well, Essential commands 31 years of consecutive dividend increases. To boot, its payout ratio is just under 56%, which is reasonable for the industry. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg WTRG as a unanimous strong buy. As well, their average price target stands at $53.25, implying 20% upside potential. Folks, this might be the leader of best utility stocks to buy for rising rates.Constellation Energy (CEG)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG) is the nation’s largest producer of carbon-free energy and provides sustainable solutions to homes, businesses, and public-sector customers across the continental U.S. It takes a while to get through the word salad but Constellation specializes in nuclear energy.Now, from a year-to-date perspective, CEG might seem like a losing proposition, shedding over 3% of equity value. However, in the past 365 days, CEG gained a whopping 72%. That might seem challenging in terms of passive income and you’d be right. Per TipRanks, its dividend yield sits at 0.71% at the time of writing.To be fair, the company could also shore up its financials. While it features strong revenue growth, its net margin slipped into negative territory on a trailing-year basis. Still, for those who want to speculate on their best utility stocks to buy, CEG could be intriguing. Right now, analysts peg shares as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $97.60, implying over 23% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So when we looked at Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Archer-Daniels-Midland is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$4.2b ÷ (US$60b - US$24b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Archer-Daniels-Midland has an ROCE of 12%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 11% generated by the Food industry. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Archer-Daniels-Midland compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Archer-Daniels-Midland.What Can We Tell From Archer-Daniels-Midland's ROCE Trend?Investors would be pleased with what's happening at Archer-Daniels-Midland. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 12%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 30%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.On a separate but related note, it's important to know that Archer-Daniels-Midland has a current liabilities to total assets ratio of 40%, which we'd consider pretty high. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Archer-Daniels-Midland's ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that Archer-Daniels-Midland can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Archer-Daniels-Midland that you might find interesting.While Archer-Daniels-Midland isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

And while the macroeconomic outlook remains challenging, investors have started 2023 with a more optimistic posture. As such, there aren’t quite as many dirt-cheap stocks today as there were last fall. However, there are still bargains out there for investors that are willing to do some sleuthing. These seven stocks to buy at a discount still offer strong value at today’s prices.That’s not just my opinion, either. Morningstar Research views all seven of these stocks as at least 19% undervalued today, and in some cases, much more than that. As such, these picks offer significant upside as sentiment improves.ROPRoper Technologies$429.02VZVerizon$38.84GPNGlobal Payments$112.78BRBroadridge Financial$140.74EMNEastman Chemical$85.43WRKWestrock$31.59EFXEquifax$202.94Roper Technologies (ROP)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockRoper Technologies (NYSE:ROP) is a conglomerate firm focused on software solutions for less glamorous markets. Roper owns software solutions for fields such as power plant management, K-12 school operations, life insurance, law firms, and so on.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis isn’t as exciting as software for consumer-facing applications. However, Roper can buy software for these niche verticals at significantly lower valuations than it would pay in more competitive industries. Indeed, Roper pivoted naturally. Decades ago, it made industrial equipment in fields such as pumps. Over time, management figured out it was more profitable to sell software and services rather than hardware, and the company changed its name from Roper Industries to Roper Technologies to reflect this evolution.The other upside of Roper is that shares are significantly cheaper than most pure-play software companies. ROP stock is selling for just 26 times forward earnings, which isn’t bad for a company with a double-digit annualized earnings per share growth record dating back to the 1990s. And, with tech currently in a downturn, Roper should find more M&amp;A targets at a reasonable price. Speaking of reasonable price, Morningstar believes Roper shares are worth $530, whereas they trade in the low $400s today.Story continuesVerizon (VZ)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comVerizon (NYSE:VZ) is one of the three primary wireless carriers in the United States. Investors have traditionally gravitated to this industry due to its stability. Phone companies have been known for strong cash flows, large dividends, and being safe havens in market storms.This view, however, came under fire thanks to rival AT&amp;T (NYSE:T). That company was forced to slash its dividend after a series of misguided acquisitions left it with way too much debt.Verizon got caught up in the backlash. Investors dumped other telecoms, including VZ stock, in the wake of AT&amp;T’s struggles. But that’s a mistake. Verizon has a stronger balance sheet, a better network, and a more capable track record of investments and capital allocation.Recently, Verizon’s results have come up a little short of expectations. The company has been in a long investment cycle rolling out 5G and other network improvements. However, Verizon should soon see the benefits of these outlays. Meanwhile, shares are trading for just 8x forward earnings and offer a 6.7% dividend yield. Morningstar sees VZ stock as 32% undervalued today.Global Payments (GPN)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) is a merchant acquirer. This is a financial services business that serves as an intermediary between credit card companies and retailers. Global Payments provides payment terminals to stores and helps with payments, accounting, fraud monitoring, and other related services. Global Payments has also moved into solutions for online payments and omnichannel retailers.The payments sector has had an absolutely awful 18 months or so, with many leading companies in the sector losing half their value or more. In many cases, those drops were justified. However, Global Payments has gotten caught up indiscriminately in the selling.The firm continues to grow; in fact, analysts expect profits to rise 11% this year, and increase another 14% next year. That’s pretty incredible, given that Global Payments is selling at just 11 times earnings today. It’s quite an unusual bargain to see a firm with healthy top-and-bottom-line growth like this selling at such a low P/E ratio. Morningstar believes that GPN stock is worth $186 per share; with the stock at $112 today, that makes it 40% undervalued now.Broadridge Financial (BR)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comBroadridge Financial (NYSE:BR) is another financial services company. It focuses on providing back-office support to brokerages, wealth management firms, and other similar businesses.Broadridge came about as a spin-off from the human resources management company Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP). Broadridge originally focused on providing proxy services. That is to say, the shareholder communications and voting functions for publicly-traded companies. Broadridge retains a market share north of 90% in the proxy business.Lately, it has branched out into other niches such as providing software and support for wealth managers, private family offices, and other similar roles. The move from paper documentation to digital solutions has given Broadridge a wide opportunity set to help firms modernize their operations.Broadridge shares have pulled back from a high of $180 to $141 over the past year. This marks a strong value. Shares are at 20 times forward earnings, and analysts forecast high single digits earnings growth going forward. Morningstar estimates a fair value of $185 for BR stock, making shares 24% undervalued today.Eastman Chemical (EMN)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comEastman Chemical (NYSE:EMN) is a specialty chemical company. It came about as a spin-off from former photography giant Eastman Kodak way back in 1993. While Kodak has faded from view, its chemical business subsidiary has grown into quite a thriving enterprise. Indeed, since the 1993 spinoff, EMN stock has delivered an 800% total return, including dividends.Many investors dismiss chemicals as a commodity business with low-profit margins and which is prone to booms and busts. That is true in many cases. However, Eastman has specialized in many niche and specialty chemical products where it’s easier to maintain a competitive moat. Some of these are quite forward-looking, as well. For example, Eastman presented at the 2021 Consumer Electronics Show “CES” where it showed off its solar films and also augmented reality heads-up display interlayers, among other products.Eastman has also been incredibly friendly to shareholders. It has bought back mountains of stock, reducing its share count from 160 million in 2013 to 120 million today. Thanks to Eastman’s current low P/E ratio, its buyback is able to retire stock at an even faster clip; the company has repurchased 15 million shares of its stock just since 2021. Pretty amazing stuff.Today, shares are going for less than 11 times forward earnings. And, in addition to the huge buyback program, Eastman also offers a generous 3.7% dividend yield. Morningstar sees EMN stock as 36% undervalued today.WestRock (WRK)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chartSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comWestRock (NYSE:WRK) is an industrial company that primarily makes boxes, cartons, corrugated packaging, and other such solutions. WestRock is a large-scale player, with leading positions in markets such as containerboard. This gives the company a competitive edge despite the low margins and cutthroat pricing often seen in the industry.WestRock’s profitability was negatively impacted during the early waves of the recent inflationary spiral. The price of lumber, and by association paper products, soared amid shortages. However, this reversed in 2022 with the prices of lumber and paper goods crashing. This should have a favorable effect on WestRock’s profits going forward.Now, however, investors are worried about potentially falling demand for packaging. We’ve seen rising inventories in some consumer product categories, such as apparel, as last year’s consumer spending boom starts to fade. However, WRK stock seems to have overreacted. Shares are down 29% over the past year, leaving shares at just 10 times forward earnings. The stock also yields 3.5%.Equifax (EFX)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comEquifax (NYSE:EFX) is one of America’s three primary credit reporting agencies. The company was hit with a massive reputational blow due to its 2017 data breach incident. However, the company has remediated the losses caused by that event and made large moves in cybersecurity to avoid a repetition of that event.In addition, Equifax nowadays is much more than just consumer credit services. In recent years, Equifax has pushed hard into workforce solutions. Think of things such as income verification, tax forms, and unemployment insurance processing. It continues to broaden its business, such as via its 2021 purchase of Kount, which is a firm that combats e-commerce fraud using artificial intelligence.EFX stock hit almost $300 per share in 2021. Now shares are trading below $200. Traders have dumped shares on fears of a recession and resultant slowdown in consumer credit usage. In addition, Equifax’s income verification services are often used for the mortgage market, so the rise in interest rates hurts volumes there.However, the sell-off appears to be overdone. Equifax is a secular growth story with several appealing divisions within the business. Even a potential recession shouldn’t slow down Equifax too much. Morningstar’s Rajiv Bhatia believes shares are worth $315 each, meaning that Equifax is 36% undervalued today.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in EMN, BR, GPN, ROP, and VZ stock.

By the fourth quarter of 2024, the firm expects home prices to fall 19% in Austin, 16% in Phoenix, 15% in San Francisco, and 12% in Seattle.Supply has increased versus demand in Pacific Coast and Southwest marketsRegionally, the West Coast and Southwest have been hit with an oversupply “reflecting local challenges, particularly very poor levels of affordability, pandemic-related distortions, and in certain markets a high concentration of employment in the technology industry,” Goldman noted.Separately, in a report from Redfin (RDFN), cities like San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose each experienced declining home values between 3% and 7% in the second half of 2022.The reason: those cities were the most expensive markets across the country, which by default means home values have more room to fall. Other reasons: the pandemic-fueled massive exodus of residents and tech layoffs.An aerial view shows homes and apartments in a neighborhood in El Paso, Texas, on December 19, 2022. - Housing starts data about new home construction is expected this week from the Commerce Department while mortgage interest rates and fears of a recession increased this year. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)Nationally, the housing outlook looks to be less dire. The bank expects home prices to fall 6.1% in 2023 as mortgage rates head toward 6.5%.However, against this backdrop, there's a potential risk as supply remains tight despite new homes under construction coming onto the market.“On net, this implies a muted impact from completions on the current supply/demand balance of housing and, ultimately, prices,” the bank said, “Even if every single home under construction was completed and listed on the market immediately, the months’ supply of homes (the ratio of inventory to annual sales) would still be below historic averages.”The pipeline of homes under construction is starting to convert into completionsIn January, builders continued to slow down home construction. Housing starts fell by 4.5% to 1.31 million annualized rate, down 21.4% from a year ago, the Commerce Department said February 16. Story continuesOther data from the National Association of Realtors notes existing home sales are slipping, while government data points to an unexpected rise in new home sales.The bank notes that the “gradual recovery of home sales in the second half of the year should act as an additional buffer” to the supply outlook.Even though home buying activity has turned shaky as the 30-fixed mortgage rate marches upward, the issue still remains the supply surplus of multi-family units.The multi-family share of total housing starts over the past 6 months has been the highest since 1984 Single-family, multi-family, and total housing starts (SAAR)Over the past six months, about 40% of total housing starts have been for multi-family units, according to Goldman. The firm noted, however, that most of these units take longer to build, which could challenge the medium- to long-term outlook for rental properties.Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

That means seeking companies with strong financials, solid growth potential, and a competitive edge in their niche.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are seven fintech growth stocks I think are worth diving deeper into.ADYYFAdyen$1,417.00MELIMercadoLibre$1,220.00FOURShift4 Payments$64.50GPNGlobal Payments$112.20TOSTToast$18.92PYPLPayPal$73.60FICOFair Isaac Corp.$677.39Adyen (ADYYF)Illustration of phone with dollar sign and other graphics symbolizing fintech displayed on and around it, with a blue backgroundSource: shutterstock.com/ZinetroNAdyen (OTCMKTS:ADYYF) is a global payment technology company offering a simplified platform to accept payments anywhere in the world. The company helps businesses increase revenue by providing customer payment solutions across multiple channels and devices. These solutions include a range of payment methods and currencies, as well as fraud prevention and data analysis tools to assist their customers.The company recently released its full fiscal year 2022 earnings results. Most metrics indicate that the company continues to experience strong overall growth, making it a reasonable investment.Adyen processed €767.5 billion of payments for the entire year, representing a 49% year-over-year increase. That resulted in €1.3 billion in total revenues, up 30% over the same period a year earlier.Story continuesAdyen noted solid growth in North America and Asia, and its shares carry several hundred dollars of upside beyond their current price. The company maintains hubs in Singapore, Chicago, San Francisco, Madrid, and Sao Paolo.MercadoLibre (MELI)MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comLatin American e-commerce company MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) provides various fintech offerings in Latin America. The company offers payment processing, digital wallets, and other financial services. Those services allow users to make payments, send money, and access credit in markets that may otherwise be under-served.The company and its fintech platform have become very popular in Latin America, where traditional banking services are less accessible. The company’s high-quality offerings have contributed to the its regional growth and success.Mercadolibre’s recent earnings report highlights the firm’s fintech success. Unique active users reached 44 million in the fourth quarter, representing a 27% increase year-over-year. MercadoLibre also rocessed $36 billion in total payment volume in Q4, a 45% increase over the same time frame. Notably, more than $25 billion of that volume was off-platform. The company’s POS (point of sale) business has expanded rapidly, with that $25 billion in payment volume representing 51% year-over-year growth.The company’s strong growth across an underserved Latin American payments landscape provides excellent upside to long-term investors.Shift4 Payments (FOUR)a person holding a smartphone over a check out scanner representing payments stocks to buySource: ShutterstockAnother up-and-coming fintech stock, Shift4 Payments (NYSE:FOUR) provides payment processing solutions and related services. The company’s offerings include contactless payments, gift cards, loyalty programs, and advanced security and fraud prevention tools. Shift4 Payments also offers a variety of software integrations to support businesses in a range of industries.FOUR stock has been relatively stable over the last year, price-wise, yet it still offers approximately 15% upside according to analysts.Shift4 Payments serves more than 200,000 current partners across the U.S., Canada, Japan, and Europe, processing over $200 billion of transactions annually.One of the more exciting developments from the company is its recent partnership with the self-checkout company Mashgin. Mashgin’s kiosks are equipped with computer vision-enabled cameras that allow users to place all their goods on kiosk trays and have them instantly rung up.Mashgin’s stadium kiosks have seen sales increases between 25%-400%, with the partnership promising to increase Shift4 Payments’ total processing volume substantially over the long-term.Global Payments (GPN)A concept image of mobile payment with a smart phone for a cup of coffee.Source: ShutterstockGlobal Payments (NYSE:GPN) provides similar offerings to the companies on this list. The company is a leading provider of a comprehensive suite of payment processing solutions and related services, including point-of-sale systems, online payments, and fraud prevention tools.But unlike the other shares listed above, GPN stock isn’t currently experiencing robust growth. Instead, 2022 revenues increased by a modest 5.2%, reaching $8.975 billion. It was more of the same in the fourth quarter, with the company posting only 2.7% year-over-year revenue growth. Fortunately, Global Payments’ net income grew by 19.1% to $258.56 million – a bright spot for the firm overall.However, Global Payments has a clear path toward growth with its acquisition of EVO Payments (NASDAQ:EVOP) expected to be completed by the end of March. That acquisition will increase the firm’s addressable markets and strengthen its current B2B payment solutions portfolio.Global Payments is shifting toward enterprise clients and away from consumer-focused businesses, with plans to divest two businesses soon.Toast (TOST)A close-up of a Toast (TOST) ordering screen.Source: TonelsonProductions / Shutterstock.comSome fintech stocks, including Toast (NYSE:TOST), also serve more niche areas of the fintech market. Toast is a cloud-based restaurant management platform that offers a variety of software and hardware solutions to support restaurant operations. Its solutions include point-of-sale systems, online ordering, and delivery management. The company serves a growing customer base domestically and internationally.Toast is fast becoming a household name within restaurant payments, posting 60% revenue growth in 2022. However, that impressive growth still did not propel Toast’s bottom line out of the red in 2022. The company posted a net loss of $275 million. The positive spin is that this net loss narrowed significantly from $487 million in 2021.Toast expects its $2.731 billion in 2022 revenues to grow to between $3.57 and $3.66 billion in 2023. That would represent top-line growth between 30.7% and 34%. The company also anticipates as much as $30 million in EBITDA, meaning it will still produce net losses in 2023 based on management’s expectations.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquartersDespite its size and prominent name, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) remains a noteworthy fintech growth stock to buy. It may be a pioneering name in the payments space, but that doesn’t mean it is a dinosaur that can’t keep up.It is more established than other names on this list. And as a consequence, it doesn’t boast the dramatic growth of several other stocks above. That said, PayPal reported meaningful Q4 and FY ’22 top-line growth of 7% and 8%, respectively.Of particular importance for fundamentals-based investors, PayPal’s earnings per share grew by 19% in Q4 after falling 41% in 2022. One interpretation of that metric is a reversal of negative momentum and a positive forward outlook.PYPL stock has proven volatile this year. It began 2023 trading at $74.58, rose to nearly $87 to start February, and has since fallen to $73. The positive is that analysts have pegged its target stock price above $99, so growth is certainly there.Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO)a pile of credit cardsSource: Teerasak Ladnongkhun/Shutterstock.comFair Isaac Corp. (NYSE:FICO) provides analytics software and tools. These solutions are utilized across the banking, insurance, and healthcare industries. Fair Issac provides credit risk assessment, fraud detection, and decision management. Most of us know Fair Isaac Corp. for the FICO credit score, determining individual and business creditworthiness.It’s also a fintech stock worth considering, underpinned by moderate growth. The company’s net income rose by 15% in Q4, reaching $97.6 million. Revenues grew by a more modest 6.98% during the same period.FICO will likely push fintech leaders to continue to define their AI strategies shortly. The company recently released its third annual State of Responsible AI in Financial Services report. The report notes an ongoing increase in demand for AI in fintech but a lack of transparency. Further, most companies surveyed have only vague notions of how to define and implement standards for AI across financial services.FICO could benefit from AI if it can improve the accuracy of the credit scores it assigns to individuals and businesses.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

84,077fd4b5-e424-3c0e-a326-75014dd216fa,GPN,2023-03-04,7 Stocks to Buy at a Discount Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-discount-now-203245042.html,1677616365,STORY,"['GPN', 'EMN', 'BR', 'EFX', 'ROP', 'VZ']","[The stock market has rallied meaningfully in recent weeks. And while the macroeconomic outlook remains challenging, investors have started 2023 with a more optimistic posture. As such, there aren’t quite as many dirt-cheap stocks today as there were last fall. However, there are still bargains out there for investors that are willing to do some sleuthing. These seven stocks to buy at a discount still offer strong value at today’s prices.That’s not just my opinion, either. Morningstar Research views all seven of these stocks as at least 19% undervalued today, and in some cases, much more than that. As such, these picks offer significant upside as sentiment improves.ROPRoper Technologies$429.02VZVerizon$38.84GPNGlobal Payments$112.78BRBroadridge Financial$140.74EMNEastman Chemical$85.43WRKWestrock$31.59EFXEquifax$202.94Roper Technologies (ROP)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockRoper Technologies (NYSE:ROP) is a conglomerate firm focused on software solutions for less glamorous markets. Roper owns software solutions for fields such as power plant management, K-12 school operations, life insurance, law firms, and so on.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis isn’t as exciting as software for consumer-facing applications. However, Roper can buy software for these niche verticals at significantly lower valuations than it would pay in more competitive industries. Indeed, Roper pivoted naturally. Decades ago, it made industrial equipment in fields such as pumps. Over time, management figured out it was more profitable to sell software and services rather than hardware, and the company changed its name from Roper Industries to Roper Technologies to reflect this evolution.The other upside of Roper is that shares are significantly cheaper than most pure-play software companies. ROP stock is selling for just 26 times forward earnings, which isn’t bad for a company with a double-digit annualized earnings per share growth record dating back to the 1990s. And, with tech currently in a downturn, Roper should find more M&amp;A targets at a reasonable price. Speaking of reasonable price, Morningstar believes Roper shares are worth $530, whereas they trade in the low $400s today.Story continuesVerizon (VZ)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comVerizon (NYSE:VZ) is one of the three primary wireless carriers in the United States. Investors have traditionally gravitated to this industry due to its stability. Phone companies have been known for strong cash flows, large dividends, and being safe havens in market storms.This view, however, came under fire thanks to rival AT&amp;T (NYSE:T). That company was forced to slash its dividend after a series of misguided acquisitions left it with way too much debt.Verizon got caught up in the backlash. Investors dumped other telecoms, including VZ stock, in the wake of AT&amp;T’s struggles. But that’s a mistake. Verizon has a stronger balance sheet, a better network, and a more capable track record of investments and capital allocation.Recently, Verizon’s results have come up a little short of expectations. The company has been in a long investment cycle rolling out 5G and other network improvements. However, Verizon should soon see the benefits of these outlays. Meanwhile, shares are trading for just 8x forward earnings and offer a 6.7% dividend yield. Morningstar sees VZ stock as 32% undervalued today.Global Payments (GPN)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) is a merchant acquirer. This is a financial services business that serves as an intermediary between credit card companies and retailers. Global Payments provides payment terminals to stores and helps with payments, accounting, fraud monitoring, and other related services. Global Payments has also moved into solutions for online payments and omnichannel retailers.The payments sector has had an absolutely awful 18 months or so, with many leading companies in the sector losing half their value or more. In many cases, those drops were justified. However, Global Payments has gotten caught up indiscriminately in the selling.The firm continues to grow; in fact, analysts expect profits to rise 11% this year, and increase another 14% next year. That’s pretty incredible, given that Global Payments is selling at just 11 times earnings today. It’s quite an unusual bargain to see a firm with healthy top-and-bottom-line growth like this selling at such a low P/E ratio. Morningstar believes that GPN stock is worth $186 per share; with the stock at $112 today, that makes it 40% undervalued now.Broadridge Financial (BR)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comBroadridge Financial (NYSE:BR) is another financial services company. It focuses on providing back-office support to brokerages, wealth management firms, and other similar businesses.Broadridge came about as a spin-off from the human resources management company Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP). Broadridge originally focused on providing proxy services. That is to say, the shareholder communications and voting functions for publicly-traded companies. Broadridge retains a market share north of 90% in the proxy business.Lately, it has branched out into other niches such as providing software and support for wealth managers, private family offices, and other similar roles. The move from paper documentation to digital solutions has given Broadridge a wide opportunity set to help firms modernize their operations.Broadridge shares have pulled back from a high of $180 to $141 over the past year. This marks a strong value. Shares are at 20 times forward earnings, and analysts forecast high single digits earnings growth going forward. Morningstar estimates a fair value of $185 for BR stock, making shares 24% undervalued today.Eastman Chemical (EMN)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comEastman Chemical (NYSE:EMN) is a specialty chemical company. It came about as a spin-off from former photography giant Eastman Kodak way back in 1993. While Kodak has faded from view, its chemical business subsidiary has grown into quite a thriving enterprise. Indeed, since the 1993 spinoff, EMN stock has delivered an 800% total return, including dividends.Many investors dismiss chemicals as a commodity business with low-profit margins and which is prone to booms and busts. That is true in many cases. However, Eastman has specialized in many niche and specialty chemical products where it’s easier to maintain a competitive moat. Some of these are quite forward-looking, as well. For example, Eastman presented at the 2021 Consumer Electronics Show “CES” where it showed off its solar films and also augmented reality heads-up display interlayers, among other products.Eastman has also been incredibly friendly to shareholders. It has bought back mountains of stock, reducing its share count from 160 million in 2013 to 120 million today. Thanks to Eastman’s current low P/E ratio, its buyback is able to retire stock at an even faster clip; the company has repurchased 15 million shares of its stock just since 2021. Pretty amazing stuff.Today, shares are going for less than 11 times forward earnings. And, in addition to the huge buyback program, Eastman also offers a generous 3.7% dividend yield. Morningstar sees EMN stock as 36% undervalued today.WestRock (WRK)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chartSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comWestRock (NYSE:WRK) is an industrial company that primarily makes boxes, cartons, corrugated packaging, and other such solutions. WestRock is a large-scale player, with leading positions in markets such as containerboard. This gives the company a competitive edge despite the low margins and cutthroat pricing often seen in the industry.WestRock’s profitability was negatively impacted during the early waves of the recent inflationary spiral. The price of lumber, and by association paper products, soared amid shortages. However, this reversed in 2022 with the prices of lumber and paper goods crashing. This should have a favorable effect on WestRock’s profits going forward.Now, however, investors are worried about potentially falling demand for packaging. We’ve seen rising inventories in some consumer product categories, such as apparel, as last year’s consumer spending boom starts to fade. However, WRK stock seems to have overreacted. Shares are down 29% over the past year, leaving shares at just 10 times forward earnings. The stock also yields 3.5%.Equifax (EFX)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comEquifax (NYSE:EFX) is one of America’s three primary credit reporting agencies. The company was hit with a massive reputational blow due to its 2017 data breach incident. However, the company has remediated the losses caused by that event and made large moves in cybersecurity to avoid a repetition of that event.In addition, Equifax nowadays is much more than just consumer credit services. In recent years, Equifax has pushed hard into workforce solutions. Think of things such as income verification, tax forms, and unemployment insurance processing. It continues to broaden its business, such as via its 2021 purchase of Kount, which is a firm that combats e-commerce fraud using artificial intelligence.EFX stock hit almost $300 per share in 2021. Now shares are trading below $200. Traders have dumped shares on fears of a recession and resultant slowdown in consumer credit usage. In addition, Equifax’s income verification services are often used for the mortgage market, so the rise in interest rates hurts volumes there.However, the sell-off appears to be overdone. Equifax is a secular growth story with several appealing divisions within the business. Even a potential recession shouldn’t slow down Equifax too much. Morningstar’s Rajiv Bhatia believes shares are worth $315 each, meaning that Equifax is 36% undervalued today.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in EMN, BR, GPN, ROP, and VZ stock.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Schlumberger Ltd., Becton, Dickinson and Co. and Marathon Petroleum Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Schlumberger shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry over the past year (+42.5% vs. +24.3%), reflecting the company's status as the largest oilfield services player, with a presence in every energy market across the globe. Being the leading provider of technology for complex oilfields, the firm is well-poised to take up new offshore projects in international markets.Higher oil prices is aiding its overall business. SLB reported strong fourth-quarter results driven by strong activities in land and offshore resources in North America and Latin America. It made significant progress in its sustainability initiatives in 2022. SLB expects its Transition Technologies portfolio to cross the $1 billion revenue mark in 2023.  However, the company’s balance sheet has massive debt exposure compared with the composite stocks in the industry. Also, the aggressive capital budget remains a headwind for the company. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Schlumberger here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Becton, Dickinson have underperformed the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry over the past year (-14.9% vs. -9.3%). The company has reported year-over-year fall in revenues, BD Life Sciences and international revenues were worrying. Lower COVID-only testing revenues are discouraging from a business perspective. BD’s operations in a highly consolidated medical technology industry and a stiff competitive space are worrying. Forex woes prevail.Nevertheless, BD’s improvement in the overall base revenues and the year-over-year uptick in bottom-line results in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 were impressive. Robust results by majority arms and in the United States were promising. The expansion of both margins bodes well.Regulatory approvals and launches were encouraging. BD’s strategic deals augur well. A strong solvency position is an added plus. BD’s results in fiscal fourth quarter were better than expected.(You can read the full research report on Becton, Dickinson here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Marathon Petroleum shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry over the past year (+67.0% vs. +23.5%). The company’s sale of its Speedway retail business for $21 billion provided the downstream operator with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement per which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.But while refining fundamentals have certainly brightened from the covid lows, the sector is not out of the woods yet in terms of cash flows that remain anaemic and well below the pre-crisis levels. In particular, the weakness in business travel demand remains a complicating factor.The continued increase in costs and expenses over the past few quarters and execution risks related to renewables foray are other negatives in the Marathon Petroleum story.

86,7042befb-7e99-3436-9156-1e6893cf1791,LEG,2023-03-04,"At US$34.42, Is Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) Worth Looking At Closely?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-34-42-leggett-platt-142421758.html,1677853461,STORY,['LEG'],"[Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG), is not the largest company out there, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$38.04 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$31.59. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Leggett &amp; Platt's current trading price of US$34.42 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Leggett &amp; Platt’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Leggett &amp; Platt What's The Opportunity In Leggett &amp; Platt?According to my valuation model, Leggett &amp; Platt seems to be fairly priced at around 0.3% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Leggett &amp; Platt today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $34.51, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Leggett &amp; Platt’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Leggett &amp; Platt look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Leggett &amp; Platt, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -15%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? LEG seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on LEG for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The price seems to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help gel your views on LEG should the price fluctuate below its true value.If you want to dive deeper into Leggett &amp; Platt, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

The technology promises to improve safety, reduce traffic congestion, and allow humans to hand over driving responsibilities to robots. As it grows, so too will investor interest in related stocks and companies. Many of these companies are developing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and other autonomous vehicle technology. These technologies use machine learning and artificial intelligence to make driving decisions from the data they collect. With AI becoming prevalent, investors are increasingly seeking stocks that capitalize on its intersection with automobiles. Traditional automakers and tech companies are investing heavily in autonomous driving technology. The long-term potential of the field makes these companies an attractive option for investors who believe in these technologies. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLAZRLuminar$8.95APTVAptiv$116.28AMBAAmbarella$94.31GOOGAlphabet$90.30BIDUBaidu$137.69INVZInnoviz Technology$4.75NVDANvidia$232.16Luminar (LAZR)Luminar (LAZR stock) sign with greenery around itSource: JHVEPhoto/shutterstock.comLuminar (NASDAQ:LAZR) is a company that develops lidar sensors and software for autonomous driving. The company’s technology is used by major automotive manufacturers including Volvo and Audi in their autonomous vehicles. Like many lidar stocks, Luminar shares spiked in late 2020 but then gave up their rapid gains throughout 2021. Demand is beginning to pick up again as broader market worries have shown some signs of easing. AI is grabbing headlines and that means Luminar will get more press moving forward. Management expects Luminar’s lidar technology to support level 3 through level 5 autonomous vehicles. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) defines 5 levels of vehicle autonomy with level 5 meaning zero human interaction is required. Luminar recently signed a deal to continue its partnership with Mercedes-Benz that will see the company’s lidar featured in next-generation Mercedes-Benz vehicles. Luimnar’s level 3 lidar systems are currently available in top-line models from the company and Luminar counts partners across major vehicle OEMs globally. Story continuesAptiv (APTV)An Aptiv (APTV) office building in Poland.Source: shutterstock.comAptiv (NYSE:APTV) is a global technology company that develops advanced electrical systems including autonomous driving software for automobiles. It is also positioning its products and services across smart cities and connectivity in general. The company has a long history in the vehicle parts industry and was formerly known as Delphi. Aptiv invested heavily in an autonomous driving joint venture with Hyundai in 2019. That 50-50 partnership was valued at $4 billion when formed and is focused on level 4 and level 5 autonomous technologies. A year earlier, Aptiv partnered with Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) to launch a fleet of 30 autonomous vehicles in Las Vegas. The company has continued to grow since, releasing fourth-quarter earnings at the beginning of February. That release describes a company in which revenues increased by 12%, reaching $4.6 billion with operations generating $933 million in cash flow. For the full year, Aptiv generated $17.5 billion in sales, also a 12% increase on a year-over-year basis.  Ambarella (AMBA)Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip.

Semiconductor stocks are in the news.Source: ShutterstockAmbarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) develops and sells video processing chips for cameras and other devices that are used across the autonomous driving sector. That makes its stock one to watch for investors interested in AI-powered vehicles. Ambarella’s products are used in applications including security cameras and automotive cameras for advanced driver assistance systems. The company has partnerships with major automotive manufacturers including Toyota (NYSE:TM), a major name in the evolving automotive space. Ambarella also produces systems-on-chip (SOCs) that allow advanced image processing and the extraction of valuable data therefrom. On Feb. 7, Ambarella announced that Shanghai-based Hyperview had selected it to provide those SOCs for its autonomous driving platforms. That means Ambarella will have an opportunity to establish its name across tier-1 manufacturers and OEMs throughout the large, quickly-growing Chinese automotive market. Consensus analyst target stock prices suggest AMBA stock has reasonably strong upside after 2 straight quarters in which it produced better-than-expected earnings per share. Alphabet (GOOG)GOOG stock: letters spelling out googleSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.comAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock is most closely associated with Google, its primary subsidiary. But Waymo is another subsidiary of Alphabet that is developing self-driving technology for commercial use. The company’s autonomous vehicles can be seen across western states including California and Arizona. Given Alphabet’s large footprint across technology, it is perhaps unsurprising that Waymo is the world’s most experienced driver with a history dating to 2009. The company’s Waymo Driver platform has logged millions of miles on real-life roads with billions of miles in simulation. Readers in Phoenix and San Francisco may be familiar with Waymo through Waymo One, its ride-hailing service. And Waymo is making inroads in the commercial driving space through Waymo Via which delivers goods via tractor-trailer trucks. Currently, investing in Waymo via public equity means buying Alphabet stock. That comes with all of the volatility of the current tech space plagued by unpredictable ad revenue. In time, though, Waymo could foreseeably spin Waymo off if it becomes advisable as a business unit. Baidu (BIDU)A Baidu (BIDU) sign outside a company office in Shenzhen, China.Source: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.comBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is China’s answer to Alphabet stock. The company engages in internet search like Google, and has been developing autonomous driving technology, like Waymo, since 2013. Biadu’s self-driving services include Apollo, which allows developers to create their own autonomous vehicles. Apolong is Baidu’s fully autonomous minibus which began mass production in 2017. Outside of its autonomous driving development, Baidu is arguably a strong buy for the simple reason that China has reopened. The resulting stimulus to the economy should highly benefit advertisers that rely on its search services, spurring growth. BIDU stock currently trades around $137 but bears a consensus $173 target price. Baidu’s Apollo program consists of two open datasets collected in San Francisco and Beijing. Those respective datasets allow developers to test their algorithms and build autonomous vehicles. The company offers lidar systems and other sensors to capture data as well. It is also one of the few Chinese companies that can produce large-scale HD mapping data through deep learning. Innoviz Technology (INVZ)graphic of an orange car emanating an array of circular yellow, green and blue lines to signify light detection and rangingSource: shutterstock.com/temp-64GTXIsrael-based Innoviz Technology (NASDAQ:INVZ) develops and sells solid-state lidar sensors for autonomous vehicles. It is another lidar stock in a company that provides 3D-environment perception for autonomous vehicles. Innoviz has partnerships with major automotive manufacturers, such as BMW and Magna (NYSE:MGA) among others. It is one of many publicly traded firms to have come online through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger, back in 2021. And like many other lidar companies, its stock has fallen since then. Innoviz’s programs and lidar target level 2, 3, and 4 autonomous driving. Innoviz Technology is set up to carve out a significant place within the autonomous driving sector. It boasts a forward-looking order book valued at $6.9 billion representing 15% of the global auto market. Further, its current pipeline of RFQs and RFIs spans 11 OEMs that represent 42% of OEMs globally. Nvidia (NVDA)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.Source: ShutterstockNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading tech company known for many things tech. Most notable to most investors is the company’s development of advanced hardware and software solutions for the autonomous vehicle industry.The company’s DRIVE platform provides a complete solution for autonomous vehicle developers. It includes an in-car solution known as DRIVE Hyperion. It includes a developer kit, DRIVE AGX, and a sensor kit. The platform also includes simulation and training platforms that allow developers to create commercial algorithms for AI-powered vehicles of the present and future. DRIVE Hyperion supports level 3 autonomous driving. Level 3 autonomy means a vehicle can safely handle all aspects of driving while engaged but still requires the driver to be ready to quickly take control if necessary. The company’s vehicle partnerships span cars, trucks, robotaxis and include Polestar (NASDAQ:PSNY), Nio (NYSE:NIO), and Foxconn among others. Foxconn is perhaps best known as a manufacturer for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and could logically manufacture an iCar should it exist in the future. In short, Nvidia has a large network spanning autonomy that should continue to evolve in interesting ways.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Northern Trust's shares before the 9th of March to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of April.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.75 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$3.00 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Northern Trust stock has a trailing yield of around 3.2% on the current share price of $94.98. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Northern Trust's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Northern Trust has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Northern Trust Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Fortunately Northern Trust's payout ratio is modest, at just 47% of profit. Northern Trust paid a dividend despite reporting negative free cash flow last year. That's typically a bad combination and - if this were more than a one-off - not sustainable.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Northern Trust earnings per share are up 4.4% per annum over the last five years.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Northern Trust has delivered an average of 9.6% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Northern Trust? It has been growing its earnings per share somewhat in recent years, although it reinvests more than half its earnings in the business, which could suggest there are some growth projects that have not yet reached fruition. In summary, Northern Trust appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it.Curious what other investors think of Northern Trust?

Shares have lost about 5.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Hologic due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Hologic Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Margins DownHologicreported first-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $1.07, down 50.7% year over year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.95 billion.Adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2023 are estimated within $3.55-$3.85 (up from thre previous guidance of $3.30-$3.60), with a projected decline of 41-36% year over year.

The approval was followed by a full market release of the same.According to Haemonetics, this software upgrade offers customers key enhancements to help simplify operations, while enhancing efficiency and improving user experience.The latest development is expected to upgrade Haemonetics’ Cell Salvage platform and broaden the company’s scope in the growing autotransfusion space.A Few Words on The Cell Saver Elite+This autotransfusion system, with its advanced technology, helps hospitals to recover a patient's blood during surgical procedures with the potential for medium-to-high blood loss. This in turn helps to avoid unnecessary allogeneic transfusions while reducing related procedure costs.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis Intelligent Control software has more than 50 automation enhancements for a better user experience. These include complete user control with a ""Manual Mode"" option, expanded wash volumes adjustable to the Association for the Advancement of Blood &amp; Biotherapies (AABB) recommended levels, and enhanced emergency options.Market ProspectsGoing by a Mordor Intelligence report, the auto-transfusion systems market is projected to witness a CAGR of 5.2% from 2019 to 2027. Per the report, the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic lowered the demand for auto-transfusion systems, thereby impacting the market's overall growth. However, the resumption of surgeries after the relaxation of regulations increased demand for autotransfusion systems. The current scenario is expected to drive the growth of the market over the forecast period.Haemonetics' Recent UpdatesHaemonetics has been witnessing strong growth in the Plasma franchise for quite some time. In the global plasma market, Haemonetics holds approximately 80% share.  Haemonetics is currently witnessing plasma market growth above historic rates, driven by an industry striving to double collections by 2025 and the rising demand for plasma-based medicines.

96,211e6037-fdf7-3c8a-bda3-b0abeb32d6d7,NFLX,2023-03-04,"Netflix is ‘still Netflix’ as they produce live Chris Rock special, resist live sports: Analyst",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/netflix-still-netflix-produce-live-204448973.html,1677876288,VIDEO,['NFLX'],"[Wedbush Managing Director in Equity Research Michael Pachter discusses Netflix and their plans to produce a live Chris Rock special, and gives his outlook on the future of media streaming rights.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: All right, well, Netflix is going live. The streaming giant will be airing the highly anticipated Chris Rock live comedy special on Saturday, bookended by pre- and post-shows. It's the first ever live stream broadcast for the company. For more on this, let's bring in Michael Pachter, Wedbush Securities managing director of equity research. Michael, it's great to see you again. So certainly, it's a big test for Netflix. What do you think of this move, venturing into the live streaming game?MICHAEL PACHTER: It's a free publicity move that's going to have no impact on their business, but it's going to get people like you to turn it into a news feature. And you're not the only one. You're about my 10th interview on this one. They-- look, they need programming. The idea that anybody's going to turn on Netflix by appointment is idiotic. We don't even know when regular TV shows are on. I think the last show I used to tune in, in real-time was ""Friends"" at 9 o'clock on a Thursday night, and I can't-- that was 25 years ago.We use our DVRs. We've all been trained by Netflix that whatever we want to watch is on-demand all the time. And in fact, we're all pissed when something like ""The Mandalorian"" comes out on Disney+ and season three came out on Wednesday, and there's only one episode. We don't get them all.So this whole concept that Chris Rock is going to stand up live, and I'm going to actually show up Saturday night to watch it, it's not any worse if I watch it the first time on Sunday or a week from now or a month from now. They're doing it solely for the publicity. This is not the same thing as signing a real live stream deal like a sports deal, which I don't think they're going to do. So Netflix is still Netflix. It's no different than it was in the past, but they managed to get news media organizations to report on this.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Your cup overflows with enthusiasm, Michael. I will tell you why I--MICHAEL PACHTER: Disdain is the right word. Go ahead. Sorry.DAVE BRIGGS: I'll tell you, I would agree with you for the most part, except for this is a cultural moment because we're all waiting for him to respond to the infamous slap from Will Smith right ahead of the Oscars, which are next weekend. This is a moment that I think has a lot of buzz, and yes, because of organizations like ours talking about it. What number of live viewers will convince you that you're wrong here?MICHAEL PACHTER: Well, what number of live viewers saw the slap in the Oscars? I think it was the lowest rated Oscars of all time. So what is that? I don't even know in the US. 10 million, 20 million? There's no chance it'll be 20 million, 0% chance of 20. And hearken back to the days of shows like ""The Blacklist,"" season one. It got 20 million viewers per episode. And the show ""24"" got 20 million viewers who tuned in, in real-time.This thing, 5 million? Sure. Who cares? It's not going to move the needle. No one is signing up for Netflix to watch this show on Saturday. And oh, by the way, five seconds after the joke about Will Smith's slap, it's going to be on Twitter. So who cares? I'll read about it on Twitter.SEANA SMITH: Michael, you've got two people here that will probably most likely be tuning in--DAVE BRIGGS: Oh, I'm in.SEANA SMITH: --to it live.DAVE BRIGGS: I'm in.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I'm excited. Maybe it's because we're part of the people that are hyping it up. So, Michael, you're not excited about this. Netflix has resisted any sort of venturing into live sports. Would that make sense to you, given the number of eyeballs that it does draw in real-time?MICHAEL PACHTER: No, you know, live sports is a hook to keep someone subscribing. So, you know, it makes sense for a cable provider, for Comcast. And it makes sense for a retransmission company, like CBS or NBC, to buy sports rights. I think Google is going to fail miserably with the YouTube purchase of Sunday Ticket. I think that's going to end up being a disaster for them. But it's going to hurt DirecTV at the same time because you're going to see people start to cut the cord.The one company out there that's kind of built a whole business on this is Fubo, FuboTV, the ticker FUBO. The stocks got crushed because they're not yet profitable, and they're still burning cash. But they are a live broadcast channel, all streaming. And it's mostly sports. I mean, they have all the other networks as well. And they can't make money. So if they're not making money focusing on that, YouTube absolutely is not making money on YouTube+. I don't-- Amazon, no chance they're making money with Thursday Night Football.So I don't think live sports is the way to go. The sports leagues have established that their rights are worth billions of dollars. And Netflix just doesn't have billions to spend on that. And we don't think of Netflix as a by appointment television broadcaster. We think of them as an on-demand, when we feel like it, and binge the whole thing. So we're perfectly happy to tune in to YouTube or tune in to Amazon Prime because we're all Prime members anyway and watch football. We're not going to join Netflix for that.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, they've made a shrewd entrance into sports with some of the series, ""Full Swing"" and ""Drive to Survive,"" the new partnership with the NFL profiling Patrick Mahomes and other quarterbacks. But let me ask you, you've got an outperform and a 410 price target here. That's more than 30% upside. What do you love about the long-term outlook for Netflix?MICHAEL PACHTER: Oh, I mean, you said I was full of enthusiasm, and I said disdain. I love their spirit. So, look, as much as I criticize them for dumb moves like this, I like that they keep getting up after getting just knocked to the ground, and they keep fighting and they keep trying. They had the crap kicked out of them for a brief period of time. They stopped growing subscribers.And they took a look in the mirror and they said, what can we change? They added an ad-supported tier. That was really smart. Not that it's going to attract that many new subscribers, but it's going to keep people from quitting. Anybody who's paying 15.49 a month who says it's too expensive and I don't watch it that often, they have to think hard about trading down to 7 bucks a month with some ads, and they probably will.So I think you're going to see a reduction in churn, which results in higher net new subscribers added because they're going to keep the old ones and add the same number of new ones. And when they grow for two or three more quarters, the stock hits my target. Let's revisit after that. I think that there's opportunity there for profitability because they're cutting their spending. And as long as they don't do stupid things like bid on sports rights and do really smart things like bid on Chris Rock live so you talk about it, I love the stock.[LAUGHTER]DAVE BRIGGS: Eagerly awaiting the Chris Rock stand-up special. Michael Pachter, we love it, man. I like your enthusiasm. Thank you, sir. Enjoy the weekend.]"

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this internet video service have returned -15%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has lost 11.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $2.81 per share, indicating a change of -20.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.18 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.4%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.29 indicates a change of +27.8% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Netflix.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NFLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Netflix, the consensus sales estimate of $8.18 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.9%. The $34.15 billion and $38.12 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8% and +11.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNetflix reported revenues of $7.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.9%. EPS of $0.12 for the same period compares with $1.33 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.84 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.18%. The EPS surprise was -74.47%.Over the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Netflix is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NFLX need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Mar 17, 2023 $50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Netflix shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Netflix is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Broadcast Radio and Television industry that ranks in the Bottom 15% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while none have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.79 per share to $2.81 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Netflix right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$152m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.2% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add TJX Companies To Your Watchlist?One positive for TJX Companies is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with TJX Companies , and understanding this should be part of your investment process.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Most Profitable Biotech Stocks Today.The term ""biotechnology"" refers to the utilization of living organisms or biological systems to create solutions that address various agricultural, industrial, and health-related problems. The most well-known application of biotechnology is the use of genetic engineering to produce therapeutic proteins and other medications. Biotech's comparative advantage over Big Pharma is its increased return on investment. According to a Deloitte report, biotech firms can produce a return on R&amp;D of 9.3% as opposed to a 1.9% return for multinational pharmaceuticals.The biotechnology sector played a crucial role in the fight against COVID-19 in 2020. BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), a German biotechnology company, was responsible for the first COVID vaccine to receive FDA approval, which was later manufactured and marketed in partnership with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines by the biotech industry was a remarkable feat that garnered much attention and appreciation. This, in turn, led to a surge in investor interest, and the biotech IPO boom of 2020 and 2021 saw 158 companies going public.12 Most Profitable Biotech Stocks TodayPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashIn 2021, Venture Capitalists invested in 3,100 biotech startups, while the industry was able to raise a staggering amount of $34 billion globally. Additionally, according to EY, in 2021, the biotechnology industry's revenues were higher by 55% compared to 2016. However, much like other sectors, the biotech sector faced a slowdown in 2022 with low venture funding and a slowdown in number of IPOs as compared to 2021. Even the companies that did go public in 2022 ended up performing not particularly well, as reported by Crunchbase. However, in May 2022, McKinsey claimed that even after the downturn, the S&amp;P biotech index had delivered ten-year returns comparable to those of the S&amp;P 500 and higher than those of the S&amp;P pharmaceuticals index.Story continuesIn the agriculture sector, biotech aims to promote sustainable farming practices that also promise high yields. While in the industrial sector, biotech is being used to generate bio-fuels which are a cheaper alternative to fossil fuels. Several traditional pharma companies have diversified their operations to include biotechnology in their business. For example, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHBY) are pharmaceutical companies that have made significant investments in the biotechnology sector.Our MethodologyTo come up with the 12 most profitable biotech stocks today, we have sourced data from websites like Yahoo Finance to identify profitable biotech companies. We then proceeded to rank the companies in our list in ascending order of their Net Income over the previous four quarters.Most Profitable Biotech Stocks Today12. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)Net Income TTM: $6.32 billionBristol Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is a renowned American biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of therapeutic solutions for oncology, hematology, immunology, and cardiovascular disease. Bristol Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) research pipeline currently includes over 50 compounds in more than 40 disease areas.On February 2, 2023, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) reported its Q4 2022 result, reporting revenue of €11.4 billion, surpassing the analysts’ projection of $11.2 billion. Additionally, the company posted an EPS of $1.82, higher than the analyst’s projection of $1.72 per share.In addition to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHBY) are included in our list of 12 most profitable biotech stocks today. According to Insider Monkey’s database, 69 hedge funds held stakes worth $1.7 billion in Bristol Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) in Q4 2022, compared to 68 funds in the prior quarter with stake worth $1.7 billion.Baron Funds mentioned Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We established a position in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and selling medicines for patients in the therapeutic areas of oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, and neurology. The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo.At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”11. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Net Income TTM: $ 6.55 billionFounded in 1980, Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a distinguished American biotechnology corporation operating across nearly 100 countries and regions worldwide, with a primary focus on six therapeutic domains: cardiovascular disease, oncology, bone health, neuroscience, nephrology, and inflammation.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) in Q4 2022, compared to 53 funds in the prior quarter with stake worth $1.5 billion.Here is what Smead Capital Management had to say about Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”10. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Net Income TTM: $6.95 billionThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is a leading provider of research equipment, reagents, and biopharmaceutical services.

The Normalized EPS of $1.52 posted by the company beat market estimates by $0.09.As per Insider Monkey’s database, 22 hedge funds held stakes worth $1.0 billion in Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) in Q4 2022, compared to 26 funds in the prior quarter with stake worth $783 million.Here is what Madison Investors Fund has to say about Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We sold our position in Novartis. We like the company’s track record of innovation, and its diversified portfolio of drugs. However, we’ve become increasingly concerned about the outlook for some of its recently launched therapeutics, as well as some generic competition in a few of its mature drugs. If pressed, we still like the odds that Novartis will do well, but the outlook is a little cloudier than it’s been in a while. As noted above, we’ve been big fans of its Alcon unit for many years, and now that Alcon is independent, we decided to concentrate our investment there.”8. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)Net Income TTM: $7.97 billionNovo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is a multinational pharmaceutical corporation that operates across two therapy-based business segments: Diabetes &amp; Obesity care and Rare Diseases (previously known as the biopharmaceutical division).

Over the past year, we trimmed our position significantly as we believed the stock’s valuation failed to reflect the windfall nature of COVID-19 vaccine cash flows. With the stock nearly 70% off its highs and, more importantly, at a reasonable discount to our PMV estimate, we view the valuation as opportunistic given its long-term profit cycle potential. BioNTech’s intellectual property in mRNA, and COVID funded manufacturing capacity leave it well-positioned to develop new mRNA vaccines and cancer therapies. In addition, the company has non-mRNA technology (e.g., cell therapy assets) and blue-chip partnerships offering additional optionality. While the company’s R&amp;D pipeline beyond COVID-19 vaccines will take some time to mature, it is well funded by close to $20 billion in COVID-vaccine proceeds. We increased our position within the GardenSM as the stock declined.”6. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)Net Income TTM: $11.76 billionModerna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is a biotech and pharmaceutical company based in the United States. The company specializes in RNA-based therapeutics, with a primary focus on mRNA vaccines.

108,ab52306c-2561-3c4d-a731-d8713c66948c,GD,2023-03-04,General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-dynamics-nyse-gd-seems-120047549.html,1677931247,STORY,['GD'],"[David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics What Is General Dynamics's Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that General Dynamics had US$10.5b of debt in December 2022, down from US$11.5b, one year before. However, it does have US$1.24b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$9.25b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is General Dynamics' Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that General Dynamics had liabilities of US$15.3b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$17.7b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$1.24b in cash and US$11.8b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$20.0b.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since General Dynamics has a huge market capitalization of US$63.3b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).General Dynamics's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1.7 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its commanding EBIT of 12.6 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. The good news is that General Dynamics has increased its EBIT by 5.0% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine General Dynamics's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. During the last three years, General Dynamics produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 73% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewGeneral Dynamics's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that General Dynamics takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. While that brings some risk, it can also enhance returns for shareholders. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with General Dynamics .If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

109,6d0b605b-7396-31e7-8967-ad4139ff3636,GD,2023-03-04,15 Biggest Private Jet Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-private-jet-companies-165444393.html,1677862484,STORY,"['HMC', 'GD']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 biggest private jet companies in the world. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Private Jet Companies in the World. The aviation industry is one of the attractive sectors in the world simply due to the nature of the products. Jets taking off and flying are still marvels of technology despite having been around for decades now. In fact, a little known fact about modern day aviation is that it started out as a private affair - since in its early days most people could not own an aircraft, and companies that sold seats instead of charters did not exist. The first human flight - of Dr. Hans Von Ohain - was of a private jet, and Lockheed's JetStar was the first business jet in the world and one which initially flew the company's executives, alongside others such as Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, President Richard Nixon, and the Shah of Iran.Fast forward to today, and the private jet industry continues to grow. According to a research report from Adroit Market Research, the charter flight market was estimated to be worth $48 billion in 2022 and will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.4% between then and 2029 to sit at an estimated $51.88 billion by the end of the forecast period. This industry is dominated primarily by companies and other large organizations that choose to ferry their employees around the world without being constrained by the hassles of commercial aviation. Additionally, Adroit Market Research also adds that the world's wealthiest are starting to turn to chartered flights more as opposed to owning their own jets, due to the high costs associated with owning an aircraft.Business Jets MarketA report from Fortune Business Insights illustrates that the business jet market was worth $25.87 billion in 2021 and will grow at a CAGR of 4.06% to sit at $38.34 billion in 2029. It explains that the market is divided into small, mid, and large sized jets, with the light and mid sized jets representing the largest chunk of the market. In terms of platform, the industry is divided into on-demand and aircraft management categories, and as a whole, the market covers propulsion systems, airframes, avionics, and software among others.Story continuesAs should be evident, the operator segment is larger than the private segment of the business jet industry, and original equipment manufacturers (OEM) are expected to see stronger growth in the future as the demand for jets grows. Finally, North America is the largest continent with a market value of $9.23 billion and Asia Pacific will be the fastest growing region. Demand for business jets is booming as well, as data from the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) - the aircraft industry's trade association - shows that 712 business jets were delivered in 2022 over the 710 delivered in 2021, even as the global economy battled inflation and high interest rates. In terms of value, the shipments were worth $26.8 billion, marking a 6% growth.Today we'll look at the biggest private jet companies in the world, with the top picks being General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), Bombardier Inc. (TSE:BBD-B.TO), and Dassault Aviation Société anonyme (EPA:AM.PA).15 Biggest Private Jet Companies in the WorldSpumador/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology In order to compile our list, we took a look at two different but interrelated segments of the market. These are the jet operators and manufacturers. For the former, since most of them are private and their revenue details are unavailable, we used total flight hours in 2022 as the ranking criteria. For the latter, their latest available 12 month revenue estimate is used, and the list starts from the operators. Finally, while Boeing and Airbus are the biggest airplane manufacturers in the world, they have not been included, since their private flying hours or private jet operations revenues are not available. We also excluded them to ensure that the list focuses more on pureplay companies.Biggest Private Jet Companies in the World15.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Large-Cap Stocks Hedge Funds Are Dumping.We are now approaching the end of the first quarter of 2023 and the markets are exhibiting an upward trend. As of March 3, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 5.58% year to date and the Nasdaq has shot up by 12.40% since the beginning of the year. After the disastrous year that 2022 was for the stock market, seeing these upward moves can make one wonder whether these moves are just short-term spikes or if they are the real deal.Morgan Stanley's Senior Vice President: ""We Think The Bear Market Is Not Over""On February 27 Morgan Stanley's senior vice president and portfolio manager, Katerina Simonetti, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance Live where she discussed her view of the markets and what she sees moving forward. Simonetti noted that 2022 was centered around ""inflation and Fed action, and markets ""underestimated inflation"" so ""now we're seeing the results of that"". Simonetti further spoke about the Fed's hiking cycle and said that since ""economic data surprised us to the positive"", the central bank is expected to continue its hiking cycle. Here are some comments from Katerina Simonetti of Morgan Stanley:""As we continue to focus on the Fed, in our view, the focus should be on the earnings revisions. Because that's where the real story for '23, in our view, is the fact that it was easier to be profitable during the times of the high inflation and as inflation is coming down, these profit margins are harder to find.""Simonetti noted that U.S. companies ""specifically are going to be revising their earnings and setting them to the more normal level"". The earnings revisions ""to the more normal level"" are going to be ""viewed by the market as a negative, as it should be"" said Simonetti, and ""this is what is really underestimated by the general investing public"". Simonetti thinks that ""there is a lot of risk in this market, and that the risk-reward is just not there"". Katerina Simonetti said that ""earnings have a long way to go"" and ""stocks seem highly overvalued"". Simonetti further said that ""another leg down"" is necessary ""to pivot our way into the next bull market"" since ""the bear market is not over"".Story continuesKaterina Simonetti said she does not think that ""there are not opportunities in this market"". Simonetti likes ""high-quality dividend-paying stocks"" in the healthcare, financials, and utilities sectors and more specifically, she likes the ""combination of blue-chip dividend-paying stocks plus higher-yielding bonds"" in the current market environment. Finally, Simonetti said that though technology outperformed all other sectors in the last bull market, she thinks ""this might not be the leading sector in the next bull market"".Hedge funds are some of the biggest players in the stock market, with their decisions potentially having a large impact on the market.

Recently, the company expanded through the acquisition of Allergan, which added robust growth assets to help offset the loss of U.S. patent protection for Humira, a leading treatment used for rheumatology, dermatology. gastroenterology, and ophthalmology. While AbbVie reported weak third quarter revenues across the board, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vraylar (an antipsychotic treatment) in December. Despite concerns around Humira’s loss of patent protection, we believe AbbVie has significantly diversified its revenue and that its launch of Rinvog for psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis could be promising.”11.

We sold our position at that time due to heightened risk associated with operations in Kazakhstan, which sends oil through a pipeline that runs through Russia out to the Black Sea. When Russia invaded Ukraine, we believed there was real risk that something would happen to inhibit Chevron’s ability to get that oil to the market. We didn’t believe that risk was reflected in the stock price, so we sold our position. Today, 10+ months into the Ukraine crisis, more information has become available regarding the Kazakhstan operations, and the associated risks are now well-known. We believe those risks are fully priced into the current stock valuation. Chevron is one of the best operators in its field, with a diversified portfolio and strong management, and we took the opportunity to reinvest when the stock was trading below our estimate of intrinsic value.”8.

(NYSE:JPM) and has a position worth $643.1 million in the company.Here is what Vltava Fund had to say about JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term.JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008.A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.”7. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 259Number of Hedge Funds That Sold: 10On February 24, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives raised his price target on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to $290 from $280 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares.

Azure now represents nearly 25% of the total business and continues to compound at a higher rate. Although growth is moderating a bit recently (as it is for AWS and Google Cloud Platform as well), these three platforms collectively generated more than $140 billion in revenue during the last 12 months and are still growing at a healthy rate. Further, Microsoft Cloud, or commercial cloud (which includes Azure and other cloud services, Office 365 Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties) continues to grow roughly 30% and is now about half the business. Mathematically, commercial cloud could decelerate to 20% growth with all other segments decelerating to zero growth and total company revenue growth would still be at least double digits. We believe Microsoft is positioned to compound underlying earnings per share at a midteens rate over the next five years. At 22x earnings, we felt the valuation was attractive and that it should be a large position.”6. NextEra Energy, Inc.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Large-Cap Stocks Hedge Funds Are Dumping.We are now approaching the end of the first quarter of 2023 and the markets are exhibiting an upward trend. As of March 3, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 5.58% year to date and the Nasdaq has shot up by 12.40% since the beginning of the year. After the disastrous year that 2022 was for the stock market, seeing these upward moves can make one wonder whether these moves are just short-term spikes or if they are the real deal.Morgan Stanley's Senior Vice President: ""We Think The Bear Market Is Not Over""On February 27 Morgan Stanley's senior vice president and portfolio manager, Katerina Simonetti, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance Live where she discussed her view of the markets and what she sees moving forward. Simonetti noted that 2022 was centered around ""inflation and Fed action, and markets ""underestimated inflation"" so ""now we're seeing the results of that"". Simonetti further spoke about the Fed's hiking cycle and said that since ""economic data surprised us to the positive"", the central bank is expected to continue its hiking cycle. Here are some comments from Katerina Simonetti of Morgan Stanley:""As we continue to focus on the Fed, in our view, the focus should be on the earnings revisions. Because that's where the real story for '23, in our view, is the fact that it was easier to be profitable during the times of the high inflation and as inflation is coming down, these profit margins are harder to find.""Simonetti noted that U.S. companies ""specifically are going to be revising their earnings and setting them to the more normal level"". The earnings revisions ""to the more normal level"" are going to be ""viewed by the market as a negative, as it should be"" said Simonetti, and ""this is what is really underestimated by the general investing public"". Simonetti thinks that ""there is a lot of risk in this market, and that the risk-reward is just not there"". Katerina Simonetti said that ""earnings have a long way to go"" and ""stocks seem highly overvalued"". Simonetti further said that ""another leg down"" is necessary ""to pivot our way into the next bull market"" since ""the bear market is not over"".Story continuesKaterina Simonetti said she does not think that ""there are not opportunities in this market"". Simonetti likes ""high-quality dividend-paying stocks"" in the healthcare, financials, and utilities sectors and more specifically, she likes the ""combination of blue-chip dividend-paying stocks plus higher-yielding bonds"" in the current market environment. Finally, Simonetti said that though technology outperformed all other sectors in the last bull market, she thinks ""this might not be the leading sector in the next bull market"".Hedge funds are some of the biggest players in the stock market, with their decisions potentially having a large impact on the market.

While AbbVie reported weak third quarter revenues across the board, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vraylar (an antipsychotic treatment) in December. Despite concerns around Humira’s loss of patent protection, we believe AbbVie has significantly diversified its revenue and that its launch of Rinvog for psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis could be promising.”11.

We sold our position at that time due to heightened risk associated with operations in Kazakhstan, which sends oil through a pipeline that runs through Russia out to the Black Sea. When Russia invaded Ukraine, we believed there was real risk that something would happen to inhibit Chevron’s ability to get that oil to the market. We didn’t believe that risk was reflected in the stock price, so we sold our position. Today, 10+ months into the Ukraine crisis, more information has become available regarding the Kazakhstan operations, and the associated risks are now well-known. We believe those risks are fully priced into the current stock valuation. Chevron is one of the best operators in its field, with a diversified portfolio and strong management, and we took the opportunity to reinvest when the stock was trading below our estimate of intrinsic value.”8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 100Number of Hedge Funds That Sold: 10In Q4 2022, 10 hedge funds dissolved their positions in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). The stock was a part of 100 investors' portfolios at the close of Q4 2022. These funds held stakes worth $5.17 billion in the company, down from $6.41 billion in the previous quarter with 110 positions. The hedge fund sentiment for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

(NYSE:JPM) to Hold from Buy and lowered his price target on the shares to $145 from $155.As of December 31, Greenhaven Associates is the leading shareholder in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) and has a position worth $643.1 million in the company.Here is what Vltava Fund had to say about JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term.JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008.A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.”7.

Azure now represents nearly 25% of the total business and continues to compound at a higher rate. Although growth is moderating a bit recently (as it is for AWS and Google Cloud Platform as well), these three platforms collectively generated more than $140 billion in revenue during the last 12 months and are still growing at a healthy rate. Further, Microsoft Cloud, or commercial cloud (which includes Azure and other cloud services, Office 365 Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties) continues to grow roughly 30% and is now about half the business. Mathematically, commercial cloud could decelerate to 20% growth with all other segments decelerating to zero growth and total company revenue growth would still be at least double digits. We believe Microsoft is positioned to compound underlying earnings per share at a midteens rate over the next five years. At 22x earnings, we felt the valuation was attractive and that it should be a large position.”6. NextEra Energy, Inc.

(Operator Instructions). I would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded today, March 3, 2023 at 8 a.m. Mountain Time. I will now turn the conference over to Kim Perry, Gold Resource Corporation's Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.Kimberly C. PerryThank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of Gold Resource team, I would like to welcome you to our conference call covering our full year 2022 results. Before we begin the call, there are a couple of housekeeping matters I would like to address. Please note that certain statements to be made today are forward-looking in nature and, as such, are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. All financial measures are unaudited. Audited financial statements will be presented in our 2022 Form 10-K which will be filed at a future date, but no later than March 15 once our audit firm completes their audit procedures. Please note, all amounts referenced during this presentation are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. Joining me on the call today is Allen Palmiere, our President and CEO; and Alberto Reyes, our Chief Operating Officer. Following Allen, Alberto and my prepared remarks, we will be available to answer your questions. This conference call is being webcast. For those of you joining us on the webcast, you can download a PDF copy of the conference call slides. The event will also be available for replay on our website later today. Yesterday's news release issued following the close of the market, and the accompanying updated technical summary report have been filed with the SEC and EDGAR and are also available on our website at www.goldresourcecorp.com. I will now turn the call over to Allen.Story continuesAllen Joseph PalmiereThank you, Kim, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank the listeners for taking the time to join us on this call. While we exceeded production guidance in 2022, the expected production results for 2023 are expected to decline approximately 25%, driven almost entirely by grade. The forecast for 2023, while generating cash flow sufficient to main our capital needs in Mexico and cover our anticipated expenditures elsewhere is tight. We took a very difficult decision to pause the dividend to protect our debt-free balance sheet. Admittedly, it is a conservative stance, but we are strongly of the belief the best way to create long-term value is to preserve our cash to ensure that we can unlock the value in the Don David Gold Mine. Our values underscore transparency and as such, we strive to ensure we keep our investment community fully apprised of information as soon as it is available. Later in the call, Kim will share more details about our 2023 guidance. We are focused on improving our cash flow through productivity improvements assessing our level of staffing and hopefully, through exploration success, which will be discussed in just a moment. A little teaser for the readers, we will publish our inaugural ESG report next week, which highlights the many ESG programs aimed at not only compliance, but also at maintaining our social license to operate by being a good neighbor to our host communities and steward of the environment. After an update on our Don David Gold operations by Alberto and prepared remarks by Kim on our financials, I'd like to provide an update on our Back Forty Project. Lastly, we'll provide a few closing remarks, and then we will take questions from participants. Now please turn to Slide 4, and I'll provide an update on our Q4 exploration results. Our #1 priority is to continue to fund the capital programs at DDGM, including our infill and expansion exploration programs in Mexico. These programs have only been constrained by available drill sites, and this remains true this year. We have never withheld capital for drilling. Unfortunately, we encountered delays in our exploration development during 2022, which resulted in being approximately 6 months behind in our drilling program. These delays involved ventilation and ground support and as the impact of working conditions and the safety of our employees that were not something that could be ignored and resulted in a delay. The technical issue was resolved in the fourth quarter, and we're currently drilling in highly prospective areas to the southeast of Switchback, the Three Sisters and the Marena target parallel to the Arista vein system. As you will have seen from our press release on Tuesday, the initial results are very encouraging and give us confidence in the potential for additional high-grade results. While it takes time to develop a resource from initial drilling, we are excited about the future. It is our objective to increase our resources and reserves this year through exploration and infill drilling programs. On Slide 5, you can see that our commitment to exploration spending since 2021 has been significant. While 2023 appears to decline from 2022, this is largely due to the development work I mentioned earlier, largely conducted in 2022. We are now in a position with drill stations and drilling has commenced. We will still have additional development requirements in 2023. However, they are not as significant as 2022. As you can see from the graph, the significant spend in 2023 relates to underground exploration expansion and infill drilling. Turning to Slide 6. We are confident in the long term at DDGM, as you'll see in the updated technical summary report filed yesterday with our 8-K. In the 12/31/22 resource model, excluding inferred material and not including the recent drill results, represents more than a 6-year mine life. We are able to replace 88% of our resources by performing infill drilling, a comprehensive view of our geological database and interpretation of the mineralization and the block models derived from them. On Slide 7, you'll see that we were able to replace reserves to the extent of 74%. The largest contributing factors 26% decline was the depletion of the reserves by 0.5 million tons relating to 2022 mining activities, offset by additions due to the reclassification of measured and indicated mineral resources to proven and probable reserves as a result of detailed engineering. I'll now pass the presentation over to Alberto to discuss the Don David Gold's full year operational results.Alberto ReyesThank you, Allen, and also good morning to all. Starting with operational health and safety, I am pleased to report the significant progress the operations team has made in cultivating a mature safety culture. The team has surpassed its quota on leading indicators and the results are reflected in an increased number of reports, while accidents and incidents continue to trend down. I am proud of the team for actively participating in identifying and correcting hazards in the workplace while partaken and campaigns, committees and the type of leadership that reinforces safety. The results and safety stats for 2023 have been impressive so far, and I'm confident that the team will continue improving the safety culture. Regarding the operations, the team was able to achieve production targets, despite the ground support needed during the construction of the ventilation raised between levels 22 and 27. Moreover, the completion of the last leg of the ventilation system has significantly improved working conditions, enabling the team to safely pursue new production targets and continuing exploration from drilling stations at the lower levels. Production increased quarter-over-quarter. The changes made to the sequence in Q4 gave access to the higher-grade material obtained from a section in the upper part of Northern Switchback that was only identified in 2022 through infill drilling. I am pleased to report that we process nearly 0.5 million tonnes of ore and sold approximately 30,000 ounces of gold, 1 million ounces of silver, equating to a combined nearly 43,000 gold equivalent ounces. We further sold over 1,300 tonnes of copper, approximately 5,000 tonnes of lead and more than 14,000 tonnes of zinc. Turning to Slide 9. In 2022, our capital expenditure of $14.8 million paid the road for production in 2023. Some of the highlights include the completion of the gold regrind circuit, the dry stack facility and approximately 4,100 meters of development for exploration purposes as well as for access to other mining levels. In other sustaining capital $3.2 million was invested in replacing some mining equipment, surface mine ventilation infrastructure and an electrical substation for the lower levels. This investment is aligned with the company's vision of sustainably growing Don David Gold Mine. I'll now pass over the presentation to Kim to discuss the financial results.Kimberly C. PerryThank you, Alberto. As previously noted, our 2022 Form 10-K will be filed in a few days Once our Audit firm has an opportunity to wrap up the audit. Therefore, all financial measures discussed are unaudited. We closed the year with a strong balance sheet, consisting of nearly $24 million in cash at December 31, 2022. Cash in 2022 declined by $10 million due to nearly $19 million in tax payments made for both 2021 and 2022, a $22 million investment in DDGM exploration and capital projects, a nearly $9 million investment in the Back Forty Project, a $1.7 million investment in Maritime Resources Corporation and nearly $4 million distributed in dividends prior to suspension. For the full year 2022, we reported net losses of $6.3 million. These losses are primarily driven by an increase in depreciation expense and the Back Forty Project costs being reflected as an expense on the P&amp;L. The increase in depreciation expense reflects the addition of the filtration plant dry stack facilities and the addition of the Gold regrind circuit, offset by lower mineral reserve depreciation base. Net sales of nearly $140 million were 11% higher than the same period in 2021 due to both higher sales volumes and commodity prices for gold and zinc. Total production cost of approximately $81 million for the year are 12% higher than the production cost for the same period in 2021. The increase is largely related to increased costs across the board for the same period in 2021. Specifically, labor costs were higher due to both inflation and an increase in headcount as a result of the 2021 Mexican labor reform. However, in Q4 2022, we commenced the exercise of rightsizing our workforce for the future. Secondly, cost of materials consumed and transportation of concentrates for both higher due to inflation. We continue to work with our suppliers to manage this risk. As Alberto mentioned earlier, we incurred additional costs related to ground support and ventilation remediation that will also continue to benefit us in the future. Don David Gold Mine's total cash cost after co-product credits was $458 per gold equivalent ounce sold and total all-in sustaining cost per gold equivalent ounce sold were $1,022 for the full year. These costs were slightly higher than 2021 costs related to the higher production costs just discussed. Moving on to Slide 11. I'd like to discuss our 2023 guidance. The 2 headlines are the year-over-year reduction in gold equivalent ounces and the increase in cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per gold equivalent ounce. The gold and silver production profile was primarily driven by expected decline in metal grades, as Allen mentioned, However, as both Allen and Alberto mentioned, there are many productivity measures being taken to address this decline in both grade and the overall production profile. With regard to cash cost, you will notice significant increase from 2022. The unit cost increase is driven primarily by the decline in the gold equivalent ounces sold. As mentioned throughout this presentation, we are laser-focused on improving operating cash flows. The 2023 guidance further demonstrates the commitment to continue investing both capital and exploration in Mexico and the final (inaudible) on G&amp;A, which is driven by the addition of highly skilled resources to our team.(technical difficulty)I think Allen might be on mute.Allen Joseph PalmiereNo, I'm here. I apologize. Sorry, operator, can everyone hear me?OperatorYes, this is operator, I can hear you.Allen Joseph PalmiereOkay. It was cutting out for some reason. Thanks, Kim, and I apologize, everyone. With the Back Forty Project, we remain optimistic. We made significant progress on the feasibility study. We've completed the mine and mill design as well as the site infrastructure layout that addressed previously raised environmental concerns. The initial capital and operating cost estimates were influenced by inflation and supply chain issues in 2021 and 2022 and resulted in higher costs than we felt were acceptable. We made a decision to slow down work on the study to evaluate alternative mining approaches and process flow sheets as well as site infrastructure layouts, all in an effort to reduce capital and operating costs. This work has resulted in a number of potential improvements. And once the work is complete and the costs appear acceptable, we will incorporate them into the feasibility study and continue to advance the project. The timing of this work is difficult to predict as it entails a substantial amount of engineering, which we are hoping we will conclude during the first half of this year. Upon completion of the feasibility study, we will present it to our Board of Directors for a production decision prior to preparing the permit applications for submittal to state agencies. Overall, 2022 was actually quite a good year. We had many accomplishments in both Mexico and Michigan, while enduring and overcoming several challenges. As we enter 2023, we are aware that we will continue to face challenges that we are prepared to handle and have already started to realize improvements. This is made possible by the strength of the team in place, which is unusual for a company of our size. Our focus has been and remains, first off, to maximize value in Mexico as is evidenced by our commitment to exploration and the results are beginning to show that, as evidenced by Tuesday's press release, we are having some encouraging intersections. We will continue to share these results as they become available. We remain focused on engineering productivity improvements to offset the impacts of inflation to improve the overall economics of the Don David Gold Mine and the Back Forty Project. While we have multiple potential opportunities, it's premature to talk about specifics, However, initial results are encouraging. Our target for 2023 is to beat guidance while expanding our resource and advancing accretive growth opportunities. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Allen, there is no question at this time. Please proceed with your closing remarks.Allen Joseph PalmiereWell, I'm a little bit surprised. I will say that we try to be reasonably comprehensive in our formal remarks. If, in fact, anybody does have questions, we can always deal with them in person or over a specific phone call in the future. I thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I wish you all a good day. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for joining, and you may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.]"

These assets perform consistently in the long-term,” he added, pointing to the example of the last recession in 2008 when “gold [increased] in value almost 300% and silver 400% in just over three years.”Rose started his career working for Prudential Securities, Morgan Stanley and the London metal exchange in England, but stated that he “always believed in having something tangible” to invest in. So when he moved to the U.S. in 1997, he became involved with gold (as well as working as a financial consultant and commodities trader) and was moved to Genesis Gold Group after seeing the interest grow in precious metals.“With what’s happening in the world today, people are interested in learning more about gold or protecting their retirement accounts whether IRAs or 401(k)s,” he said, suggesting gold and even silver are great ways to provide that barrier. “There’s a lot more stability in having something tangible than having fear currency.”How it works, Rose explained, is “if you have a retirement account, the IRS lets you roll over your IRA or 401(k) into a precious metals IRA so it’s still an IRA, you still get your statements. The only difference is you have physical gold and silver that’s held at a licensed depository backed by major exchanges with your name on it so to speak.”Story continuesMore: Automatic 401(k) Enrollment Could Be Coming SoonPrecious metals work in self-directed IRAs (one in which you manage yourself rather than working with a broker, for example). As Rose explained, “People invest real estate in self-directed IRAs, or mineral or oil rights and crypto currencies. There’s also equities they can still invest in this way, self-directed accounts just gives them a lot more control.”Per the IRS, you can generally do one tax-free rollover every year so there’s also safety in the fact that you can change in and out of investments at any time, including precious metals. “So you can roll it into gold and hold onto it for one year or three to five years (we recommend gold as a long-term hold anyway) and then roll it back into equities, whatever you want it to be invested in.”Rose likened the growing interest in gold commodities to the rise of bitcoin the past few years for anyone on the fence about this strategy — it’s just one more unique way to diversify your portfolio.“The past five years, bitcoin was the new gold with everyone touting it as the next generation of investments. I believe there’s space for that and bitcoin is here to stay, but it definitely wasn’t the new gold because a lot of these cryptos have lost 70% of their value and people that actually put cryptos in their IRAs and 401(k)s have lost substantial amounts of money,” he said. “But now people are coming back to the realization that gold is still going to shine and it’s still always going to be a stored value. That’s the thing with gold, it’s got a track record that’s been seen since the dawn of civilization. Whole worlds have been created and fallen on it. It’s not going anywhere.”And when you’re ready to take distributions, it’s pretty simple, said Rose. “It’s one of the things I love about precious metals IRAs. If you have an IRA and take RMDs (required minimum distributions), you can actually liquidate the gold or silver and take the cash value and receive the cash or actually take possession of the metals at that point. That’s something 90-95% of our clients do who are retired or retiring. Rather than cash it out, unless they need the money, they want to take possession of the metal and hold on to it and store it. It’s very simple to liquidate.”Retirement Planning: Average 401(k) Balances Fell 20% in 2022 — Will It Be a Trend?See: 67% of Americans Haven’t Taken This Key Retirement Step — Have You?Rose does caution that, like any other investment, the value of gold goes up and down and should be seen as a long-term option. “We are not day traders. We have a saying: ‘You don’t wait to buy gold, you buy gold and wait.’ So if you’re looking to buy gold and sell it in a month or six months or a year, I’d say gold isn’t for you. It’s really a long-term hold and should be looked at that way. If you look at gold and silver over the past five years, it’s increased 35-40%. And based on what we are seeing, we are very bullish on gold, it looks to repeat those numbers again.”More From GOBankingRates10 US Real Estate Markets To Avoid for NowFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily NewsletterMaximize your savings with these 3 expert tipsTake Our Poll: How Do You File Your Taxes?This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Precious Metals May Be a Good Way To Save for Retirement — How To Rollover Your IRA]"

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.62%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.17%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 12.91%.Coming into today, shares of the processor of debit and credit card payments had lost 5.17% in the past month. In that same time, the Business Services sector lost 5.68%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 4.54%.Investors will be hoping for strength from MasterCard as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.70, down 2.17% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $5.61 billion, up 8.58% from the year-ago period.MA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $12.13 per share and revenue of $25.03 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +13.9% and +12.55%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for MasterCard. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

The data did not indicate whether transport of ore has improved.Copper mines in the country have long faced disruption from community protests that have at times led to lengthy shutdowns.Peru's copper production dropped 3.63% in January from a year earlier, official data showed, the first decline after three straight months of increases.Las Bambas, producer of some 2% of global copper, has operated at full power since the start of March after choppiness since early February.Antapaccay, hit by attacks on its site and supply trucks, has returned to full activity this week, according to the data and a source close to the mine, after a lengthy downturn, also since early February.Representatives of Las Bambas and Antapaccay were not immediately available for comment.Story continuesHowever, communities in Chumbivilcas province, a key area for the southern mining corridor, were planning to meet on Friday to discuss a possible restart of protests.""For now (the mining road) is free, but we have a meeting tonight and we will see what measures we take,"" Carlos Quispe, a leader of the Chumbivilcas Defense Front, told Reuters.""If we maintain things or block the road again, that is decided by the communities themselves.""(Reporting by Marco Aquino; Editing by Adam Jourdan and Cynthia Osterman)]"

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$11.5bUS$13.4bUS$12.7bUS$13.0bUS$13.5bUS$13.6bUS$13.8bUS$14.0bUS$14.2bUS$14.5bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x11Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 0.91%Est @ 1.26%Est @ 1.50%Est @ 1.67%Est @ 1.79% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10.0% US$10.5kUS$11.1kUS$9.6kUS$8.9kUS$8.4kUS$7.7kUS$7.1kUS$6.5kUS$6.0kUS$5.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$81bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 10.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10.0%– 2.1%) = US$187bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$187b÷ ( 1 + 10.0%)10= US$72bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$153b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$124, the company appears about fair value at a 10% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at QUALCOMM as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.332. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for QUALCOMMStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Semiconductor industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

While we are unable to comment on any pending license requests, we work with customers and partners worldwide to comply with all applicable export controls and meet market demand.”A senior State Department Official said the document was a preliminary draft prepared by a contractor, and the department ""would not have approved of the report in its current form."" It also said the government ""has written and contracted multiple reports on this subject, based on different contingencies, which arrive at very different conclusions.""The White House and Commerce Department declined to comment. Huawei did not respond to a request for comment.The document shows the Biden administration is seeking to assess the impact on U.S. companies of proposed Huawei policy changes before imposing new rules that could crimp projected revenue streams at a time when the tech industry is already reeling. It also provides unusual insight into the politically sensitive question of which U.S. companies are seeking business ties to Huawei, one of Washington's most penalized Chinese companies.Story continuesReuters could not learn the details of the specific policy change whose impact was being assessed in the report.The report suggested Qualcomm would likely suffer a ""moderate economic impact"" from the change in policy, in contrast to Huawei. Indeed, the loss of access to Qualcomm's modem chips would have a bigger impact on Huawei, the report forecast, since Huawei ""relies heavily on Qualcomm's modem chips to support its smart phone offering.""Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment.Reuters reported in 2021 that U.S. officials had approved license applications worth hundreds of millions of dollars for Huawei to buy chips for its growing auto component business, including vehicle components such as video screens and sensors, as trade restrictions crippled other business lines.Huawei was placed on the ""entity list"" in 2019 amid fears it could spy on Americans and allegations it was stealing intellectual property and violating sanctions. The U.S requires that suppliers seek a special license that is usually denied when selling U.S. goods to companies on the list. But the Trump administration instituted a more lenient policy for Huawei, blocking its access to 5G chips but allowing other items like 4G chips to be shipped to the firm.The Commerce Department's top export controls official, Alan Estevez, said this week the Trump-era policy allowing U.S. technology below the “5G level"" to be shipped to Huawei was ""under assessment.""But sources say there are differences within the administration odds over how far to go: some officials advocate blocking all licenses to Huawei suppliers and revoking existing authorizations, while others want to extend restrictions only to 4G chips and other targeted technologies going forward.(Reporting by Alexandra Alper; Additional Reporting by Karen Freifeld and Stephen Nellis; Editing by Chris Sanders and William Mallard)]"

(NYSE:BAX) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 88% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baxter-international-inc-nyse-bax-123517740.html,1677933317,STORY,['BAX'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Baxter International implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 15 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownershipUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyA look at the shareholders of Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 88% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Baxter International, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Baxter International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Baxter International?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Baxter International already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Baxter International's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Baxter International. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 10% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.8% and 7.2% of the stock.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 15 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Baxter InternationalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Baxter International Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company.

132,f9f12944-f245-3ab6-9396-0fae6640e92b,WEC,2023-03-04,The 7 Best Utility Stocks to Buy as Yields Rise,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-utility-stocks-buy-201613035.html,1677615373,STORY,"['WTRG', 'AWK', 'EXCVV', 'WEC', 'XEL', 'SO']","[With monetary policy possibly about to take a turn for the worst for risk-on assets, investors should consider the best utility stocks to buy. Unfortunately for Wall Street, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index came in hotter than economists anticipated. In turn, this dynamic suggests that the Federal Reserve may raise the benchmark interest rate to combat stubbornly high inflation.Fundamentally, the best utility stocks to buy shield investors from significant volatility because of their underlying natural monopoly. According to Investopedia, “[a] natural monopoly is a type of monopoly that exists typically due to the high start-up costs or powerful economies of scale of conducting a business in a specific industry which can result in significant barriers to entry for potential competitors.”What makes the below names of the best utility stocks to buy stand out is that they enjoy a combination of relatively strong upside price targets with passive income. Now, the degree to which investors receive either attribute will vary. However, I provided a diversity of ideas so that you can pick what works best for your portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSOSouthern Co.$63.55EXCExelon Corp.$40.72XELXcel Energy$64.72WECWEC Energy$89.24AWKAmerican Water Works$140.61WTRGEssential Utilities$42.90CEGConstellation Energy$74.95Southern Co. (SO)the southern company logo displayed several times on a screenSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Southern Co. (NYSE:SO) is a gas and electric utility holding company. Per its public profile, it’s the second-largest utility in terms of the customer base as of 2021. Through its subsidiaries, it serves nine million gas and electric utility customers in six states. In the trailing year, SO stock slipped 0.32%.For passive income, Southern features a robust forward yield of 4.29%. This hits higher than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. As well, the company commands 21 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Certainly, this will be a status that management will want to keep going.Story continuesAccording to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), SO rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, the company features solid operational attributes. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 10%, above 66.3% of the competition. Also, its net margin is 12.08%, also above 66% of the field. Currently, Wall Street analysts peg SO as a consensus hold. However, their average price target ($70.40) implies 9% upside potential. Thus, SO makes for a balanced example of the best utility stocks to buy.Exelon (EXC)The logo for Exelon (EXC) is visible at the top of an office building.Source: photosounds / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) is the largest electric parent company in the U.S., per its public profile. Presently, it features approximately 10 million regulated electric utility customers. Since the January opener, EXC slipped over 4%. In the trailing year, shares gave up nearly 3% of equity value.On the passive income front, Exelon offers a decent showing, posting a forward yield of 3.48%. Although it’s a bit below the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%, the company features a payout ratio of 57.45%. That affords the yield a bit more confidence and credibility. To be fair, though, Exelon only features one year of dividend increases. As for its financials, Exelon is currently working through the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. However, it did manage to post a trailing-year net margin of 11.37%. This stat ranks above 62.53% of the competition.Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg EXC as a consensus moderate buy. In addition,  their average price target stands at $46.30, implying 12% upside potential. Thus, it makes a solid case for the best utility stocks to buy.Xcel Energy (XEL)close-up of Xcel Energy (XCEL) logo in black and red displayed on smartphone screenSource: shutterstock.com/rafapressBased in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) is a regulated electric utility and natural gas delivery firm. Per its corporate profile, the company serves more than 3.7 million electric customers and 2.1 million natural gas customers across parts of eight states. Since the Jan. opener, XEL declined by 6%. In the trailing year, it’s underwater to the tune of 2%.Still, XEL might be a solid discount among the best utility stocks to buy. For passive income, the company carries a forward yield of 3.16%. While it’s a bit under the sector average, Xcel commands 20 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. As well, its payout ratio of 57.6% is relatively manageable.Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculations, XEL rates as modestly undervalued. As well, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 8.1%, above 60.75% of the competition. Also, its net margin pings at 11.34%, outpacing 62% of its peers. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg XEL as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $73.75, implying 12% upside potential. Thus, it’s well worth considering the best utility stocks to buy.WEC Energy (WEC)WEC Energy Group logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comCalling Milwaukee, Wisconsin home, WEC Energy (NYSE:WEC) is a leading Midwest electric and natural gas holding company with subsidiaries serving 4.6 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota. Since the January opener, WEC gave up over 3% of its equity value. However, in the trailing year, it managed to poke its head barely above breakeven.Still, with investor fears rising about the Fed’s future monetary policy strategy, WEC may rank among the best utility stocks to buy. For passive income, the company carries a forward yield of 3.43%. That’s almost in line with the sector’s average yield. As well, it’s on a 19-year streak regarding consecutive annual dividend increases. So close to 20 years, management won’t give up this payout without a fight.According to Gurufocus.com, WEC rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, the utility features a three-year revenue growth rate of 8.5%, outpacing 62.53% of the field. Its net margin almost touches 15%, which beats out 75% of its rivals. Finally, covering analysts peg WEC as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $102.40, implying 12.5% upside potential. Therefore, it’s another balanced example of the best utility stocks to buy.American Water Works (AWK)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comA public utility firm, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) provides water and wastewater services in the U.S. Per its public profile, the company provides these services to approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states. It serves a total of approximately 14 million customers. Since the Jan. opener, AWK fell more than 8%, indicating a higher risk profile. For the trailing year, it’s down 6.3%.Objectively, AWK may require patience. For instance, it trades at a trailing multiple of 31.39, which ranks on the high side. Further, the relevance of its water business should keep the machinery going. As evidence, its net margin stands at 21.62%, outpacing 87.58% of the competition. In terms of passive income, AWK sits a bit on the modest side, with a forward yield of 1.85%. However, the company enjoys 13 years of consecutive dividend increases. In addition, its payout ratio of 50.93% indicates confidence in its sustainability.Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg AWK as a consensus hold. However, their average price target stands at $162.20, implying almost 15% upside potential. Thus, it can make up ground in the capital gains department, making it one of the best utility stocks to buy for rising rates.Essential Utilities (WTRG)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA utility firm with stakes in Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia, Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) provides drinking water and wastewater treatment infrastructure and services. As with American Water Works, Essential Utilities features a higher-risk profile. Since the beginning of Jan., WTRG slipped nearly 8%. For the trailing year, it’s down almost 6%.Still, contrarian investors may consider WTRG as one of the best utility stocks to buy for rising rates. Per Gurufocus.com, WTRG rates as modestly undervalued. Operationally, the company really comes to life. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 15.7%, ranking better than 80.49% of the field. On the bottom line, its net margin stands at 22.04%, outpacing over 88% of sector rivals.Regarding passive income, WTRG doesn’t provide the most generous rate with a forward yield of 2.59%. Still, it’s something. As well, Essential commands 31 years of consecutive dividend increases. To boot, its payout ratio is just under 56%, which is reasonable for the industry. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg WTRG as a unanimous strong buy. As well, their average price target stands at $53.25, implying 20% upside potential. Folks, this might be the leader of best utility stocks to buy for rising rates.Constellation Energy (CEG)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG) is the nation’s largest producer of carbon-free energy and provides sustainable solutions to homes, businesses, and public-sector customers across the continental U.S. It takes a while to get through the word salad but Constellation specializes in nuclear energy.Now, from a year-to-date perspective, CEG might seem like a losing proposition, shedding over 3% of equity value. However, in the past 365 days, CEG gained a whopping 72%. That might seem challenging in terms of passive income and you’d be right. Per TipRanks, its dividend yield sits at 0.71% at the time of writing.To be fair, the company could also shore up its financials. While it features strong revenue growth, its net margin slipped into negative territory on a trailing-year basis. Still, for those who want to speculate on their best utility stocks to buy, CEG could be intriguing. Right now, analysts peg shares as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $97.60, implying over 23% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Now, even as the economy continues to emerge from the worst of the pandemic disruptions, persistent inflation and higher interest rates are stressing companies’ balance sheets, which can discourage dividend payments.Continue reading]"

Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. Investors in Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 27%. That's disappointing when you consider the market declined 6.2%. Longer term shareholders haven't suffered as badly, since the stock is down a comparatively less painful 18% in three years. Even worse, it's down 14% in about a month, which isn't fun at all. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Crown Castle To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Even though the Crown Castle share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. But we might find some different metrics explain the share price movements better.Crown Castle's dividend seems healthy to us, so we doubt that the yield is a concern for the market. The revenue trend doesn't seem to explain why the share price is down. Unless, of course, the market was expecting a revenue uptick.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. You can see what analysts are predicting for Crown Castle in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Crown Castle the TSR over the last 1 year was -24%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 6.2% in the twelve months, Crown Castle shareholders did even worse, losing 24% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 7% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Crown Castle has   3 warning signs  (and 2 which are a bit concerning)  we think you should know about.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

There's the recent push into the space by CVS (CVS), with its $10.6 billion Oak Street Health acquisition, and Amazon (AMZN) acquiring One Health Medical for $3.9 billion. But all that activity is a reason to pause and reflect what kind of culture for-profit entities will bring to a medical service space.That's according to SCAN Health Group CEO Dr. Sachin Jain, who said the acquisitions could be an opportunity to connect existing health care verticals with the new clinical services. (See video above.)For example, CVS is not just a national drug chain anymore. It is also an insurance company and pharmacy benefits manager. That means it will want one part of its business to support the other, like finding a way to ""highlight"" Oak Street Health with its Aetna members, according to an executive on the latest earnings call.""I've just been around the block enough to know that, oftentimes, publicly traded entities don't necessarily understand clinical culture. They're making decisions, sometimes, for the short term,"" Jain said. ""When you're making decisions to hit a quarterly earnings target, you aren't necessarily doing the things you need to do to improve peoples' health over the long term.""It's why the deals could easily fall apart in the future. Or not. The jury is still out.""They're still figuring it out,"" Jain said.In addition to providing health care services, retail pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens (WBA) are looking to get into the drug trial space, but even that is a work in progress.Jain currently runs the California-based non-profit insurance company, but has held several positions in the past including in the U.S. Health Department, at Anthem (now Elevance Health (ELV)) and Merck (MRK). He is part of a segment of experts that worry about the impact of mergers and acquisitions by large for-profit entities in health care. Over the years, the cost of care has gone up as a result of such M&amp;A activity and an influx of private equity, according to studies.Story continuesIt's why, for now, traditional health care organizations are still the best bet. But that could change with the retail moves.""I worry that some of these entities will put profits before patients. I think the American public is tired of being seen as a profit center when it comes to their health and their wellness,"" Jain said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest trending stock tickers of the Yahoo Finance platformClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

(MRK) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-merck-co-inc-140002866.html,1677852002,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck (MRK) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +3.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.5% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Merck belongs, has lost 0.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.38 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -35.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -11.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.87 points to a change of -8.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -4.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.56 indicates a change of +24.6% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Merck is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRK _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Merck, the consensus sales estimate of $13.76 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -13.5%. The $58.48 billion and $62.28 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.4% and +6.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $13.83 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.3%. EPS of $1.62 for the same period compares with $1.80 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.65%. The EPS surprise was +3.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

139,a6fcd637-e955-32f2-bb2c-135ee8ba0afc,BA,2023-03-04,Is It Too Late To Consider Buying The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-boeing-company-130041110.html,1677934841,STORY,['BA'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Boeing’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Boeing Is Boeing Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Boeing is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $354.00, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Boeing’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will Boeing generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. In Boeing's case, its revenues over the next few years are expected to grow by 49%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. If expense does not increase by the same rate, or higher, this top line growth should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since BA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor?

Chief Executive Dave Calhoun will not receive a $7 million bonus due to the company's failure to enter the 777X into service by the end of 2023, Boeing said Friday.Boeing offered the performance-based incentive to Calhoun when he replaced former CEO Dennis Muilenburg in January 2020 and required that Calhoun achieve seven milestones by the end of this year.Boeing's compensation committee determined in August 2022 that the award would not vest when it became clear that Calhoun would not meet the 777X entry into service goal by 2023, according to a company filing posted on Friday afternoon ahead of an April 18 shareholder meeting.Calhoun took home $7 million in pay last year, slightly less than his $7.4 million compensation in 2021, Boeing stated in the filing.

The split between wide- and narrow-body jets was not immediately clear.An IndiGo representative told Reuters the airline is constantly in talks with manufacturers as it plans its next phase of growth. ""However, we haven't finalised anything till now.""Airbus declined to comment on any talks, saying it is ""always in contact with existing and potential customers"". Boeing had no immediate comment.IndiGo, which counts a 55% share of the domestic market, is widely expected to maintain Airbus as its supplier of narrow-body jets to squeeze out further economies of scale.It is already one of Airbus's largest customers and has so far ordered a total of 830 Airbus A320-family jets of which 488 are still to be delivered.But Indian analysts say Airbus will face a tougher fight for the wide-body order. In a departure from its single-aisle strategy, IndiGo last month began international operations with a Boeing 777, its first wide-body aircraft, taken from codeshare partner Turkish Airlines, which provides the pilots.Story continuesRECORD DEMANDEfforts by Indian carriers to keep pace with the world's fastest-growing aviation market, serving what is soon to become the largest population, have sent industry records tumbling even though manufacturers are struggling to meet output goals.Tata-owned Air India last month sealed deals for a record 470 jets from Airbus and Boeing and plans to lease another 25 for immediate needs, bringing the acquisition to 495 aircraft.The head of budget airline Akasa Air told Reuters last month it would place a ""substantially"" large order for new narrowbody jets this year on top of an existing Boeing 737 MAX order.Industry publication CAPA reported last month that IndiGo was looking at around 500 jets as Air India closed its own deal.Indian aviation has been hobbled in the past by airline failures, weak infrastructure and questions over the rights of foreign leasing companies that step in to finance the sales.While analysts have warned the market could overheat again, Dublin-based Avolon, one of the largest lessors, has said consolidation and airport upgrades have improved the outlook and India is set to remain a major source of growth.Indigo began operations in 2006 and flies to more than 75 Indian cities including to remote destinations in the country's northeast. It also flies internationally to nearby places including Dubai, Singapore, Hanoi and Maldives and is expanding into Europe through its partnership with Turkish Airlines.(Reporting by Aditi Shah, Tim Hepher; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)]"

Unfortunately for Wall Street, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index came in hotter than economists anticipated. In turn, this dynamic suggests that the Federal Reserve may raise the benchmark interest rate to combat stubbornly high inflation.Fundamentally, the best utility stocks to buy shield investors from significant volatility because of their underlying natural monopoly. According to Investopedia, “[a] natural monopoly is a type of monopoly that exists typically due to the high start-up costs or powerful economies of scale of conducting a business in a specific industry which can result in significant barriers to entry for potential competitors.”What makes the below names of the best utility stocks to buy stand out is that they enjoy a combination of relatively strong upside price targets with passive income. Now, the degree to which investors receive either attribute will vary. However, I provided a diversity of ideas so that you can pick what works best for your portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSOSouthern Co.$63.55EXCExelon Corp.$40.72XELXcel Energy$64.72WECWEC Energy$89.24AWKAmerican Water Works$140.61WTRGEssential Utilities$42.90CEGConstellation Energy$74.95Southern Co. (SO)the southern company logo displayed several times on a screenSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Southern Co. (NYSE:SO) is a gas and electric utility holding company. Per its public profile, it’s the second-largest utility in terms of the customer base as of 2021. Through its subsidiaries, it serves nine million gas and electric utility customers in six states. In the trailing year, SO stock slipped 0.32%.For passive income, Southern features a robust forward yield of 4.29%. This hits higher than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. As well, the company commands 21 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Certainly, this will be a status that management will want to keep going.Story continuesAccording to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), SO rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, the company features solid operational attributes. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 10%, above 66.3% of the competition. Also, its net margin is 12.08%, also above 66% of the field. Currently, Wall Street analysts peg SO as a consensus hold. However, their average price target ($70.40) implies 9% upside potential. Thus, SO makes for a balanced example of the best utility stocks to buy.Exelon (EXC)The logo for Exelon (EXC) is visible at the top of an office building.Source: photosounds / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) is the largest electric parent company in the U.S., per its public profile. Presently, it features approximately 10 million regulated electric utility customers. Since the January opener, EXC slipped over 4%. In the trailing year, shares gave up nearly 3% of equity value.On the passive income front, Exelon offers a decent showing, posting a forward yield of 3.48%. Although it’s a bit below the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%, the company features a payout ratio of 57.45%. That affords the yield a bit more confidence and credibility. To be fair, though, Exelon only features one year of dividend increases. As for its financials, Exelon is currently working through the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. However, it did manage to post a trailing-year net margin of 11.37%. This stat ranks above 62.53% of the competition.Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg EXC as a consensus moderate buy. In addition,  their average price target stands at $46.30, implying 12% upside potential. Thus, it makes a solid case for the best utility stocks to buy.Xcel Energy (XEL)close-up of Xcel Energy (XCEL) logo in black and red displayed on smartphone screenSource: shutterstock.com/rafapressBased in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) is a regulated electric utility and natural gas delivery firm. Per its corporate profile, the company serves more than 3.7 million electric customers and 2.1 million natural gas customers across parts of eight states. Since the Jan. opener, XEL declined by 6%. In the trailing year, it’s underwater to the tune of 2%.Still, XEL might be a solid discount among the best utility stocks to buy. For passive income, the company carries a forward yield of 3.16%. While it’s a bit under the sector average, Xcel commands 20 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. As well, its payout ratio of 57.6% is relatively manageable.Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculations, XEL rates as modestly undervalued. As well, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 8.1%, above 60.75% of the competition. Also, its net margin pings at 11.34%, outpacing 62% of its peers. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg XEL as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $73.75, implying 12% upside potential. Thus, it’s well worth considering the best utility stocks to buy.WEC Energy (WEC)WEC Energy Group logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comCalling Milwaukee, Wisconsin home, WEC Energy (NYSE:WEC) is a leading Midwest electric and natural gas holding company with subsidiaries serving 4.6 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota. Since the January opener, WEC gave up over 3% of its equity value. However, in the trailing year, it managed to poke its head barely above breakeven.Still, with investor fears rising about the Fed’s future monetary policy strategy, WEC may rank among the best utility stocks to buy. For passive income, the company carries a forward yield of 3.43%. That’s almost in line with the sector’s average yield. As well, it’s on a 19-year streak regarding consecutive annual dividend increases. So close to 20 years, management won’t give up this payout without a fight.According to Gurufocus.com, WEC rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, the utility features a three-year revenue growth rate of 8.5%, outpacing 62.53% of the field. Its net margin almost touches 15%, which beats out 75% of its rivals. Finally, covering analysts peg WEC as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $102.40, implying 12.5% upside potential. Therefore, it’s another balanced example of the best utility stocks to buy.American Water Works (AWK)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comA public utility firm, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) provides water and wastewater services in the U.S. Per its public profile, the company provides these services to approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states. It serves a total of approximately 14 million customers. Since the Jan. opener, AWK fell more than 8%, indicating a higher risk profile. For the trailing year, it’s down 6.3%.Objectively, AWK may require patience. For instance, it trades at a trailing multiple of 31.39, which ranks on the high side. Further, the relevance of its water business should keep the machinery going. As evidence, its net margin stands at 21.62%, outpacing 87.58% of the competition. In terms of passive income, AWK sits a bit on the modest side, with a forward yield of 1.85%. However, the company enjoys 13 years of consecutive dividend increases. In addition, its payout ratio of 50.93% indicates confidence in its sustainability.Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg AWK as a consensus hold. However, their average price target stands at $162.20, implying almost 15% upside potential. Thus, it can make up ground in the capital gains department, making it one of the best utility stocks to buy for rising rates.Essential Utilities (WTRG)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA utility firm with stakes in Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia, Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) provides drinking water and wastewater treatment infrastructure and services. As with American Water Works, Essential Utilities features a higher-risk profile. Since the beginning of Jan., WTRG slipped nearly 8%. For the trailing year, it’s down almost 6%.Still, contrarian investors may consider WTRG as one of the best utility stocks to buy for rising rates. Per Gurufocus.com, WTRG rates as modestly undervalued. Operationally, the company really comes to life. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 15.7%, ranking better than 80.49% of the field. On the bottom line, its net margin stands at 22.04%, outpacing over 88% of sector rivals.Regarding passive income, WTRG doesn’t provide the most generous rate with a forward yield of 2.59%. Still, it’s something. As well, Essential commands 31 years of consecutive dividend increases. To boot, its payout ratio is just under 56%, which is reasonable for the industry. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg WTRG as a unanimous strong buy. As well, their average price target stands at $53.25, implying 20% upside potential. Folks, this might be the leader of best utility stocks to buy for rising rates.Constellation Energy (CEG)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG) is the nation’s largest producer of carbon-free energy and provides sustainable solutions to homes, businesses, and public-sector customers across the continental U.S. It takes a while to get through the word salad but Constellation specializes in nuclear energy.Now, from a year-to-date perspective, CEG might seem like a losing proposition, shedding over 3% of equity value. However, in the past 365 days, CEG gained a whopping 72%. That might seem challenging in terms of passive income and you’d be right. Per TipRanks, its dividend yield sits at 0.71% at the time of writing.To be fair, the company could also shore up its financials. While it features strong revenue growth, its net margin slipped into negative territory on a trailing-year basis.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Mid-America Apartment Communities How Quickly Is Mid-America Apartment Communities Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Shareholders will be happy to know that Mid-America Apartment Communities' EPS has grown 21% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The good news is that Mid-America Apartment Communities is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 5.0 percentage points to 31%, over the last year.

So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Mid-America Apartment Communities' forecast profits?Story continuesAre Mid-America Apartment Communities Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$19b company like Mid-America Apartment Communities. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$119m. This comes in at 0.6% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Mid-America Apartment Communities, the median CEO pay is around US$12m.Mid-America Apartment Communities offered total compensation worth US$7.7m to its CEO in the year to December 2021. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Is Mid-America Apartment Communities Worth Keeping An Eye On?For growth investors, Mid-America Apartment Communities' raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. If you still have your doubts, remember too that company insiders have a considerable investment aligning themselves with the shareholders and CEO pay is quite modest compared to similarly sized companiess.

150,8cc51a33-efc3-3158-97c0-8c904526f495,MAA,2023-03-04,3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks: A Smarter Way to Boost Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-ranked-dividend-stocks-141002879.html,1677852602,STORY,['MAA-PI'],"[Here's an eye-opening statistic: older Americans are more afraid of running out of money than of death itself.And unfortunately, even retirees who have built a nest egg have good reason to be concerned - with the traditional approaches to retirement planning, income may no longer cover expenses. That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.For example, 10-year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6.50%, which translated to an income source you could count on. However, today's yield is much lower and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements.The impact of this rate decline is sizable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.So what can retirees do? You could dramatically reduce your expenses, and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don't diminish. On the other hand, you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady, higher-rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksAs a replacement for low yielding Treasury bonds (and other bond options), we believe dividend-paying stocks from high quality companies offer low risk and stable, predictable income investors in retirement seek.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.One way to identify suitable candidates is to look for stocks with an average dividend yield of 3%, and positive average annual dividend growth. Many stocks increase dividends over time, helping to offset the effects of inflation.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.06 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.57%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield of 3.61% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.61%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 21.95%. Check Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) is paying out a dividend of $0.72 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 4.35% compared to the Banks - Foreign industry's yield of 3.06% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 3.51% over the past year. Check Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.23 per share, TowneBank (TOWN) has a dividend yield of 3.07%. This is compared to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 2.05% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 15%. Check TowneBank (TOWN) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Bottom LinePursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio. Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low-fee mutual funds or ETFs, this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you’re Warren Buffett, it instantly became one of the stocks to buy due to investor overreactions.“Our ability to deliver growth on top of the $40 billion of sales growth achieved over the prior two-year period while navigating persistent inflation, ongoing global supply chain disruptions, and a tight labor market is a testament to investments we have made in the business, as well as our associates’ relentless focus on our customers,” stated CEO Ted Decker.Home Depot didn’t miss Q4 2022 estimates. On the top line, it had revenue of $35.83 billion, $140 million less than the consensus, plus earnings per share of $3.30, two cents higher than analyst expectations. But plenty of other well-known businesses did.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIf you’re considering making a contrarian bet, these three stocks to buy missed analyst estimates for the third quarter, but are definitely worth buying.NFLXNetflix$322.13MAAMid-America Apartment Communities$160.10SIVBSVB Financial$288.11Netflix (NFLX)The Netflix logo on a tablet with earbuds and a bowl of popcorn nearby.Source: Riccosta / Shutterstock.comFirst on this list of stocks to buy is Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which reported its Q4 2022 results on Jan. 19. On the top line, revenue came in at $7.85 billion, flat on a year-over-year basis. However, on the bottom line, it earned 12 cents per share, 33 cents worse than the Refinitiv consensus.After such a big earnings miss, you would think the share price would drop in value. However, the opposite occurred, as NFLS stock gained nearly 17% in the week following its earnings release. The significant decline in earnings had to do with a $462 million non-cash unrealized loss on its Euro-denominated debt in the quarter due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar versus the Euro.Story continuesIn reality, Netflix added 7.66 million subscribers during the fourth quarter, 3.09 million higher than analyst expectations. But, more importantly, the company said that it didn’t see much switching of plans by customers, which means few customers to date are moving down to a cheaper, ad-supported tier.Netflix is confident that its ad-supported tier can contribute significantly to its overall revenue without affecting its premium plans. CFO Spence Neumann said as much in comments made during its Q4 2022 conference call.“[W]e wouldn’t be getting into this business, obviously, Reed, as you know, if it couldn’t be a meaningful portion of our business,” Neumann stated. “So, we’re over 30 billion in revenue, almost 32 billion in 2022. And we wouldn’t get into a business like this if we didn’t believe it could be bigger than at least 10% of our revenue and hopefully much more over time in that mix as we grow.”Trading at 4.53-times sales, its valuation remains attractively lower than it’s been since 2014.Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA)Image of a man holding a key chain with a key and house attached to the key ring over a office desk in the backgroundSource: ShutterstockMid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:NFLX) reported its Q4 2022 results on Feb. 1. On the top line, its revenue was $527.97 million, nearly $2 million lower than the consensus estimate. However, the multi-unit residential real estate investment trust (REIT) generated $2.32 a share in funds from operations (FFO), five cents better than the analyst estimate.Overall, the REIT’s fourth-quarter results were generally better than expected.“As the broader economy adjusts to a higher interest rate environment, we believe that MAA is well positioned to capture another year of solid performance from our existing portfolio.  Supported by a strong balance sheet, the company can also capture new growth opportunities that we believe will likely emerge,” stated CEO Eric Bolton in Mid-America’s press release.I included MAA in a January article about buying seven REITs that will be big winners in 2023. My rationale for Mid-America is that it targets young, single, high-income professionals who primarily live in Sunbelt U.S. cities such as Atlanta, Dallas, Tampa, Charlotte, and Orlando.As the CEO mentioned, it has a strong balance sheet, with total debt to adjusted total assets of just 28.4% and net debt of 3.71-times adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).Dividend investors will like it’s paid a dividend for 116 consecutive quarters (29 years). For 2023, it expects to grow its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) by $8.16 a share at the midpoint of its guidance.MAA trades at 20.1-times its 2023 AFFO.SVB Financial (SIVB)bank stocksSource: fizkes / Shutterstock.comMy favorite U.S. bank is suffering a mid-life crisis. No, not really. SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB) operates a banking business heavily tied to the tech industry. Unfortunately, that means lower revenues and profits across the board, but I think this is still among the top stocks to buy, for good reason.The bank holding company reported Q4 2022 results in mid-January that missed the analyst estimate for earnings by 65 cents. Analysts were expecting $5.27 a share. It earned $4.62 a stake in the fourth quarter, 26% lower than a year ago.There was some good news. SIVB’s revenue in the quarter was $1.54 billion, $50 million higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top line.As I said, the company does business with innovators, entrepreneurs, venture capital and private equity firms, and everyone else that makes Silicon Valley and other tech-heavy regions tick.CEO Greg Becker’s Q4 2022 shareholder letter painted an optimistic tone despite the challenging banking environment for a company focused on innovation.“We have seen four consecutive quarters of declining V.C. investment, but the pace of decline appears to be slowing. U.S. V.C. investment dollars, at $238 billion – while 30 percent lower than 2021 – were higher than in any other year,” Becker stated.Down 53% over the past year, under $300, SIVB is an excellent long-term buy.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

I'd also like to remind everyone that a replay of this call will become available there shortly as well. With that, I'll turn it over to Doug.Doug Hirsch: Thank you, Aubrey. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. GoodRx operates with a clear mission, to make healthcare affordable and convenient for all Americans. I am proud of report that in 2022, we made great progress delivering on that mission. We've saved consumers over $55 billion since our founding. In 2022 alone we saved more than $10 million consumers over $200 on the cost of their medications. For many, those savings are life changing and the medication adherence we support can be lifesaving. Before discussing our recent performance, I want to highlight a few of the accomplishments that have made these incredible savings possible and are helping to lay the foundation for future growth.First, we leverage technology acquired through RxNXT to launch a new collaboration with Express Scripts. Today allegeable Express Scripts members are automatically able to receive GoodRx discount prices as part of their pharmacy benefits. It's built right into their card with no action required on the consumers' part. Through Express Scripts, we're excited to work with Cigna, which has made this program available to all participating Cigna Health Plans, encompassing over 10 million lives. With positive early results, Express Scripts continues to educate and enroll planned sponsors across the balance of their commercial book of business. This program opens up a huge new segment of the prescription savings TAM for us and we're seeing great early results.Over the coming months, we plan to continue rolling the offering out to other health plans as a way to expand our reach in serviceable, addressable market. Based on an August 2020 survey we commissioned, we estimate that 70% of consumers do not know that the price of a prescription can vary widely across pharmacies. With this product, consumers can now benefit from GoodRx without having to consciously price shop. The collaboration is seamless for payers, benefit plans and most importantly, eligible Express Scripts members who are now getting access to GoodRx prices for eligible generic medication when that price is lower than their benefit price. We've also made important progress with our provider partners as we continue to expand the health care provider value proposition and make GoodRx a destination for providers.We've now enrolled almost 400,000 new prescribers into provider mode. One way we did this was by delivering new offerings, in part enabled by past acquisitions such as flipMD. This brings even more value to these providers, who are choosing to use GoodRx as a way to improve patient outcomes. Lastly, we've expanded our core retail network. We recently added Sams Club and their 560 retail pharmacy locations to our network of pharmacies that accept GoodRx discount, another proof point in our strengthening retail network. And we look forward to extending GoodRx's value to Sams Club shoppers. While there is much to be proud of in advancing our mission, 2022 was not the year we anticipated in terms of financial performance. The grocer issue that began in the first half of the year impacted us significantly, and we haven't yet recouped the volume loss resulting from that event.But our resourceful team used this event as an opportunity to take actions to make the business more resilient, and we exited the year with results that were better than our expectations following the grocer issue. Since the second quarter of 2022, we expanded adjusted EBITDA and consistently drove high cash conversion in line with our priorities. We have more work to do, but I am pleased with how our team responded to the unexpected challenges and the progress we are making. Trevor will provide more details on our actions in a moment. We believe our consumer facing offerings remain incredibly relevant in light of the current macroeconomic environment. When economic uncertainty increases, American families take a close look at their expenses, and we expect even more consumers to turn to GoodRx for help with their healthcare needs.A reminder catalyzed by the grocer issue last year was how critical it is for us as a company to engage even more deeply with our partners to ensure mutual success, and the degree to which our relationships deliver value to our entire ecosystem. As we articulated in our third quarter earnings call, we are taking a hybrid approach to our pharmacy and retailer constituents, where we have complemented our PBM networks contracts with formalized retail relationships to ensure ecosystems stability. As a result of prioritizing increasing engagement, we now have direct contracts with many of our top pharmacy partners. Our pharma manufacturer solutions' offering continues to benefit from the shift to digital ad spending, and we expect that to remain the case for the foreseeable future.At the end of the fourth quarter, over 7 million consumers use GoodRx across our prescription and subscription offerings. Our net promoter score is 90 among both healthcare providers and consumers, and speaks to the value we continue to provide and the preference for our platform over other options in the marketplace. And we continue to deepen our relationships with consumers through our engagement efforts. These engagement efforts resulted in the doubling of the proportion of prescription transactions by fully registered members between the start of the third quarter and the end of the fourth quarter. I want to briefly touch on our strategy and in particular, four key areas of investment we believe will position us for long term profitable growth.Number one, create a more direct consumer relationship to increase touch points and access. Number two, built on our strong foundation to increase savings across the entire prescription basket, including by leveraging our deep HTP relationships. Number three, grow our leading position as the B2B partner of choice across retailers, PBMs and pharma manufacturers, driving foot traffic for retailers, volume for PBMs and awareness, access and adherence for pharma, all of which we anticipate will increase our relevance even further. And number four, leveraged data and marketing to reach more consumers and providers and drive higher revenue from our users be they visitors, max, subscribers or health care providers. This brings me to another point.While we separately disclose max and subscription counts, we view our users as a rate along a spectrum of opportunity for us. Subscribers have the deepest relationships with us, engaged consumers have growing relationships, and max, who have not yet fully registered as well as visitors, create opportunities for strong future relationships. Regardless of the consumer type, we are expanding our relevance to them. I am looking forward to continuing to deliver on our mission and make further progress on our strategic priorities in 2023. I will now turn the call over to Trevor to provide more details on the quarter and on our strategic priorities.Trevor Bezdek: Thank you, Doug, and good afternoon everyone. Before getting into our fourth quarter results, I'm going to update you further on actions we've taken to strengthen our retail, PBM and pharma manufacturer relationships. As Doug said, the last quarters were disappointing relative to our original aspirations, primarily due to the unanticipated headwind presented from the grocer issue. However, from crisis comes opportunity, and we applied our learning from the first half of last year to make our business and specifically our prescription transactions offering, even more durable going forward. The steps we have taken span our entire ecosystem of retailer and PBMs and all our staff, structures, systems and shared values.No stone was left unturned. Our hybrid strategy Doug mentioned has now been implemented across our key retailers, greatly enhancing the stability and strength of our retail and PBM relationships. Moreover, we are happy to announce the recent addition of Sams Club our core prescription transactions network, showcasing our retail strength. Consumers can now present a GoodRx discount at over 560 Sams Club locations across the US and access our low prices on medications, regardless of whether or not there are Sams Club member. With our retail network continuing to strengthen and expand, our hybrid strategy has helped to offset the churn we have seen at the grocer. I am proud of the resilience our employees and partners demonstrated throughout the year.Additionally, our engagement efforts are bearing fruit. We have doubled the proportion of prescription transactions by fully registered members between the start of the third quarter and the end of the fourth quarter, and progress is continuing. We expect higher registrations will drive more frequent and customized engagement with consumers, which we believe will increase the LTV of these relationships. Beyond the engagement efforts, we are continuing to deepen our relationships with consumers by offering timely, relevant and actionable services and content. These include our medicine cabinet functionality that we believe helps drive adherence for consumers, prescription transaction revenue for us, volume for PBMs and foot traffic for retailers.We believe that we continue to offer the most competitive prices on medications in the industry, feeding our key competitors on the top 30 prescribed medications in America, 87% of the time at top pharmacies by our analysis. We believe our competitive position has never been stronger, and when we take a new entrant into our space seriously, the stickiness of our relationships with over 80% of our transactions being repeat is a direct function of our value proposition. Our take rates has remained stable since the grocer issue, which demonstrates the value that PBMs derived from us by leveraging millions of consumers across the GoodRx network. Volume across pharmacies increased approximately 5% quarter-over-quarter and approximately 12.5% year-over-year, excluding the impacts from the grocer issue.We believe that growth is much faster than the broader prescriptions market, which we estimate excluding COVID vaccine was up approximately 3% in the fourth quarter year-over-year. In addition, the impact to our prescription transaction volume from registration efforts to support engagement in Q4 '22 represented a smaller headwind than we expected. Within our subscriptions platform, we successfully launched initiatives to help ensure Gold members consistently receive even better pricing relative to our core prescription transaction offerings than in the past. On the marketing side, we launched product and CRM initiatives to drive growth and reduce churn, including incorporating gold pricing on to core price savings. As one of our strategic initiatives, product innovation and delivering on product initiatives, the result in near term growth will remain a key focus and is critical for sustaining our competitive advantage.Medicine, Care, HealthPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashWe believe we will see Gold user growth in the quarters to come, and we lapped last year's subscription fee increases. Across prescription transactions and prescriptions offerings, our platform serves millions, over 7 million at the end of the quarter. This represents an increase of over 1 million consumers since we became a public company. Pharma manufacturing solutions revenue declined in the quarter against a difficult year-over-year comparison, and pockets of advertising sped moderation across manufactures. We increased our engagement with pharma customers and rolled out a number of solutions to help manufacturers reach more patients and providers. We enabled several exciting medication assets products for high profile pharma customers.For example, our Dexcom G6 and G7 work, including rebates, saving $200 for consumers. We believe we're becoming even more critical to the largest global manufacturers. Through our investments in new solutions, we are solving critical pain points for manufacturers and catalyzing further growth in the $30 billion pharma manufacturers' solutions TAM. Despite some slowing in manufacturer decision making starting in the fourth quarter, we anticipate strong secular tailwinds and growth over the long term as pharma sales and marketing spend increasingly shifts to digital in the quarters and years ahead. We believe our runway is very long. I'm particularly excited about GoodRx provider mode. In the fourth quarter we saw strong provider growth with almost 400,000 providers engaging with us through our provider mode technology, and in turn we are building capabilities, connect those increasingly engaged providers to brand partners in new and beneficial ways.I could not be more enthusiastic about what our team has achieved. There are significant synergies between provider mode and our pharma manufacturers' solutions platform, and we look forward to sharing more on these initiatives and our growing momentum into 2023. Turning to our fourth quarter highlights. Total revenue of $184.1 million was down 14% year-over-year, but above the top end of our fourth quarter guidance for revenue of $175 million to $180 million. Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $50 million represented a margin of approximately 27% was also ahead of our adjusted EBITDA guidance. Efficiency gains were driven by actions to improve marketing efficiencies and productivity. Sales and marketing came in at 46% of revenue in the quarter, consistent with our third quarter and our cash flow provided by operating activities was $31.9 million, compared to $33.7 million in the third quarter.During 2022 we adjusted to the new macro reality with the goal of advancing our mission and maximizing shareholder value. We prioritize investments that we expect will drive adjusted EBITDA growth in the near term, as well as profitability and cash conversion. We remain focused on initiatives and innovations that we believe will pay back sooner with higher certainty. Along with our focus on increasing our marketing efficiency, we are very early in realizing the benefits of acquisitions made over the last three years, which includes RxNXT exciting technology that underlies our Express Scripts integrated savings collaboration, and our Scriptcycle acquisition, which contributes to our success in our hybrid PBM and retail contracting strategy, as well as vitaCare critical, branded drugs, access and assurance capabilities that support our pharma manufacturer solutions offering.We have taken specific actions to drive focus and efficiency, including divesting our GoodRx Care backend technology to wheel, while maintaining the consumer facing GoodRx Care website and mobile app. This is an example of our ability to positively impact our expense structure and asset light model, while simultaneously focusing on our end user experience. Our focused strategic and tactical prioritization has positioned us to build on the adjusted EBITDA margin improvement we've achieved relative to the second quarter of 2022 in the future. We are confident we have strengthened our business model, the stabilization and expansion of our retail network and the increasing value we add to our PBM and pharma manufacturers and customers, have laid the foundation for returning to year-over-year revenue growth as we move closer to lapping the grocer headwinds in the fourth quarter of 2023.We remain committed to executing on our mission to make healthcare more affordable and accessible to Americans and to returning to our historical levels of adjusted EBITDA margin and revenue growth, driving value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Karsten to discuss our financial results and guidance.Karsten Voermann: Thank you, Trevor. Total revenue for the quarter decreased 14% year-over-year to $184.1 million, which exceeded our quarterly guidance of $175 million to $180 million. Prescription transactions revenue growth was down 19% year-over-year to $129.4 million, but was also ahead of our expectations by approximately $4 million. The estimated grocer issue impact to our revenue in the quarter was approximately $40 million to $50 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 while the volume friction from engagement efforts was again less than we expected. Max declined 8% year-over-year to $5.9 million, while PTR per MAC decreased approximately 11% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter. The shift in volume to other retailers from the grocer contributed to the Y-o-Y, PTR per MAC decrease, the average volume of scripts for MAC at the grocer was higher than the average volume of scripts per MAC across all pharmacies prior to grocer issue arising, likely due to the historical low consumer pricing at the grocer.Flu activity and the increase in growth across the prescriptions market had a slight positive volume impact; however we did see some offsetting impact from adverse weather in the latter part of December. In line with our expectations, pharma manufacturing solutions revenue declined 23% year-over-year in the fourth quarter to $24.9 million, driven partly by our increased focus on prioritizing recurring service arrangements relative to the prior year from timing and from a moderation and spending across pharma companies, resulting in part from some deal approval periods being extended by our customers. Revenue is up 2% quarter-over-quarter and full year revenue growth was up 36%, despite the challenging fourth quarter comp last year. We remain very optimistic about this business long term, and our ability to drive growth in this extremely large and fast growing $30 billion market.Turning to subscriptions, subscriptions revenue again was very strong, growing 42% year-over-year to $24.6 million, approximately $2 million ahead of our latest expectations as the Gold membership fee increase implemented in the first half of 2022, more than offset the churn related decline and paid members. We ended the quarter with over 1 million plans, down 15% year-over-year and approximately 1.5 million total members, with both plans and members lower as a result of the continued churn throughout the fourth quarter from the pricing increase. Kroger Savings declined sequentially as expected, given its reduced priority. Other revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $5.2 million, slightly ahead of our expectation. Cost of revenue is $17.4 million or 9% of revenue versus $13.9 million or 7% of revenue in Q4 '21.An increase in personnel related to consumer support and the vitaCare acquisition primarily drove the year-over-year increase. Product development and technology expenses were $36.8 million or 20% of revenue compared to $35.1 million or 16% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by increases in third party costs associated with cloud computing and hosting arrangements and in stock based compensation expense, partially offset by lower allocated overhead as a result of lower headcount as well as higher capitalization of qualified costs related to software development. Adjusted product development, technology expense was relatively flat at $26.3 million compared to $25.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sales and marketing expenses were $84.1 million or 46% of revenue versus $106.5 million or 50% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 and declined approximately 2% quarter-over-quarter.As Trevor and Doug discussed, we are proactive in managing marketing expenses in response to the current environment, our efficiency goals and our adjusted EBITDA and cash conversion focus. We will continue to look for ways to further leverage our marketing spend, while still building the GoodRx brand. Excluding stock based compensation expense and other items, adjusted sales and marketing expense was down 22% year-over year and was 43% of revenue compared to 47% of revenue in the year ago quarter. Despite lower marketing spend, we've modestly increased our MAC count quarter-over-quarter. General and administrative expenses were $28.6 million or 16% of revenue, versus $35.4 million or 17% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by stock based compensation, principally related to non-recurring co-CEOs' award made in connection with the IPO.Excluding stock based compensation expense and other items, adjusted G&amp;A expenses as percentage of revenue is 7% compared to 5% percent in the fourth quarter of 2021. The decline in sales resulting from the grocer issue is the primary contributor to the increase in adjusted general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues. Net loss was $2 million compared to a net loss of $39.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and was impacted by the grocer issue and our investment in vitaCare, partially offset by our ability to proactively manage marketing spend. Adjusted net income was $27.4 million compared to $40.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA decrease 20% year-over year to approximately $50 million, which was ahead of expectations.The decline in our PTR related to the grocer issue was the biggest driver with an estimated impact of approximately $40 million to $50 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $110 million to $120 million for the year, which we believe has an almost straight flow through to adjusted EBITDA. We expect vitaCare will continue to be a drag in adjusted EBITDA margins as we work to scale and integrate the business. Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27% was down 230 basis points year-over-year due to the flow through impact of the revenue from the grocer falling. We are pleased with our resiliency and our profitability since the issue and we are committed to driving efficiencies and targeted growth investments. We generated net cash, provided from operating activities of $31.9 million compared to $49.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.Cash conversion will remain a key focus along with growing our adjusted EBITDA going forward as we progress through 2023. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. These priorities play a critical role in our organizational realignment and how we are thinking about growing adjusted EBITDA and cash flow going forward. We expect to continue to focus on high return projects and investments and deploy capital in ways that create the most value for shareholders most quickly. Currently, our priorities are investing for organic growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet, buying back shares, and possibly strategic M&amp;As that aligns with her longer term priorities. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended the quarter with $757.2 million in cash on the balance sheet, and $667.1 million of outstanding debt.I'd now like to spend a moment talking about our guidance. For the first quarter we expect prescription transactions revenue of approximately $134 million to $135 million, which assumes impacts from the grocer issue of approximately $35 million to $45 million and ongoing engagement effort had been consistent with the fourth quarter of '22. Recall, as we have discussed previously, we expect to continue seeing a year-over-year impact from the grocer issue until 4Q 2023, when we'll lap the volume impact. Our expectation for PTR per MAC is to show a modest decrease quarter-over-quarter until that time. We expect subscription revenue of approximately $23 million to $24 million, slightly down quarter-over-quarter from the decreasing levels of price increase churn as we are nearing the anniversary of fee increases implemented last year.We may see additional churn, although we'd expected to be increasingly modest in future quarters. We expect pharma manufacturers' solutions revenue to increase modestly in the first quarter following the same fourth quarter to first quarter pattern as a year ago, and also due to the continuing effects of longer deal approval cycles discussed on our last earnings call and the resulting delays in our ability to deliver and recognize revenue. As a reminder, this offering comprises of relatively large, often multimillion dollar deals that can create quarterly volatility depending on agreement and delivery time. From our pharma manufacturers solutions, we expect Q1 revenue of approximately $20 million down 15% year-over-year and 20% quarter-over-quarter.However, we have a number of engagements we're working on with some of the largest manufacturers, which we anticipate will drive sequential growth in future quarters. The favorable macro tailwinds driving more digital or outreach to HCPs and their staff and a focus by pharma manufacturers and continue to move more spend to digital, generally make me highly optimistic about our ability to grow this offering sequentially in coming quarters and over the coming years. Finally, we expect other revenue to be approximately $4 million in the first quarter, which is slightly below the fourth quarter. In aggregate, the total outlook for revenue is $181 million to $183 million in the first quarter. We anticipate making additional targeted investments that quickly scale some of our new retail expansions, as well as our efforts to drive user engagement.We are also integrating and working to better leverage vitaCare, which will be a key growth driver in our pharma business in the coming years. As we said in our last earnings call, the new pioneer period can mean opportune time to invest in marketing, so while we didn't invest substantially in the fourth quarter, we're maintaining the flexibility to do so. For that reason, expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to fall in the mid-20% range for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect total revenue across our entire business of approximately $780 million to $790 million, and adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-20 range. As I mentioned with respects for the first quarter, maintaining the flexibility to make strategic and tactical investments throughout the year remains a priority.On the capital deployment side, I'd also like to call out for everyone that the equity relating to our co-CEO grants made around the time of our IPO will be delivered to our co-CEOs in the fourth quarter. We expect to withhold part of the equity to cover the recipient's taxes and to use cash to pay the taxing authorities. The exact amount depends on the stock price, but anticipated figure in the range of $40 million to $75 million of cash will be required to fund the tax obligation. Finally, also on the cash and capital deployment side, I'd like to note that approximately $148 million over original $250 million share repurchase authorization remains. Our strategy is clear, to deploy capital only to where we see potential for higher returns and profitable growth and where investments are strategic and support proven offerings.We look forward to leveraging our brand and technology to continue strengthening our platform for the long term and returning to our historical profitability growth profile. With that, I'll turn over to Trevor for closing remarks.Trevor Bezdek: Thanks, Karsten.

And with no set norms for military space behavior, some fear a potential space weapon attack that could generate far more debris.At stake are billions of dollars in assets - the orbital devices crucial to navigation and smartphone maps, text messaging, calls and internet connections that are used by industries and people globally.U.S. Space Command on Friday released a formal list of what it views as responsible space behaviors, in a bid to steer military norms in orbit.""The idea is we hope our adversaries do the same,"" Brigadier General Richard Zellmann, deputy director of the command's operations unit, told Reuters.The wide-ranging report includes a section on space debris that urges space players to dispose safely of their defunct satellites and notify other operators if any problems with their spacecraft might pose a debris hazard.""You have to find a way to allow the economy to grow in the space domain, and in order to do that you need to make sure that it remains sustainable,"" said Zellmann, who oversees much of the Pentagon's space tracking efforts.""Key to that is going to be ensuring that we can either solve that debris problem, or at least mitigate it to the point that it's acceptable.""While governments try to tackle international rules, the immediate response to the littering of orbit is coming in large part from the private sector.Tokyo-based Astroscale, with subsidiaries in the U.S. and Britain, is testing a debris removal device called ELSA designed to latch onto defunct satellites and drag them toward Earth's atmosphere for a fiery disposal.Story continuesJack Deasy, vice president of business development at Astroscale's U.S. subsidiary, said industry-specific policies for space behavior similar to the norms proposed by U.S. Space Command are urgently needed before a catastrophic collision occurs that could lead to burdensome regulations.""That kind of rushed, crisis-driven thing is not always the best way of setting up long-term policies that sustain the ecosystem,"" he said.Elon Musk's SpaceX has launched thousands of Starlink internet satellites in low-Earth orbit in recent years. A handful of other companies, including Jeff Bezos' Amazon , plan to do the same.""Particularly in the (low-Earth orbit), which is increasingly crowded, the people who are investing billions of dollars to run those constellations have a lot of incentive to keep that clean themselves,"" said Deasy.Astroscale this week closed a series G funding round that brought in $76 million, a substantial sum in an industry otherwise facing a drought in investment as investors seek safer bets amid rising inflation.Putting the firm's total funding at $376 million, investors included Mitsubishi Electric and Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, a prospective passenger on SpaceX's next-generation Starship rocket system.""Garbage scattered in outer space can become a big problem in the future,"" Maezawa tweeted on Monday as he announced a $23 million investment in Astroscale.Another part of the space debris mitigation equation is in-space satellite servicing, concepts in development by dozens of firms including Astroscale, Northrop Grumman, Maxar and Airbus. The idea: deploy service satellites to approach and latch onto broken or fuel-spent spacecraft to extend their lifespan.Those mission extension concepts, which Astroscale and Northrop Grumman have begun testing in space, have sprouted a patchwork of other companies looking to build on the momentum.Australia-based Neumann Space, for instance, is developing a technology that could help recycle old, defunct satellites into fuel - using the scrap metal to generate plasma thrust for new satellites. That could be used in partnership with satellite-serving companies, it hopes.""It's great because you can do mission extension by refueling with what's already in space,"" Neumann Chief Executive Herve Astier said. His company plans to launch a test satellite in June.""Using the metal that's already there, that's a way to move forward in terms of sustainability.""

157,a47d2c26-e936-3a74-b3b9-2ba37057233d,WFC,2023-03-04,Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 75% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-company-nyse-wfc-110044302.html,1677927644,STORY,['WFC-PD'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Wells Fargo's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 25 shareholders own 49% of the company Insiders have sold recently If you want to know who really controls Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 75% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Wells Fargo. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Wells Fargo already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Wells Fargo's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Wells Fargo is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.0% and 4.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Wells Fargo &amp; Company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$117m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 25% stake in Wells Fargo. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Healthcare Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.According to a report by T.Rowe Price, healthcare stocks can be generally divided into two categories. The first is high-growth stocks from the life sciences and biotechnology segments. These companies are promising breakthrough therapies, have high valuations and aggressive growth models. However, investing in these stocks is not without risk and volatility. The second category comprises major pharmaceutical companies that are mature and considered as defensive plays. Earnings growth expectations for these companies are more “modest but also expected to be more consistent from quarter to quarter,” the report added. The report also gave some practical advice to investors when it comes to healthcare stocks:“If you are a disciplined long-term investor, health care stocks may be a good addition to the aggressive part of your equity portfolio. For example, of the equity portion of a well- diversified portfolio, 20% might be in health care.”The Bull Case for the US Healthcare IndustryA team of Morgan Stanley analysts highlighted the bull case for the US healthcare sector in a 2019 report. The report said that the US healthcare sector has outperformed broader markets over the past 45 years. Most importantly, the report said that the sector has outperformed during five of the last six recessions, that too by 9% on average. This makes the healthcare sector worthy of investors’ attention as we are in the middle of a recession scenario that is becoming likely by the day amid persistent inflation and the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes.The Morgan Stanley report highlighted that unlike other sectors, the healthcare sector’s underperformance tends to be short-lived.The report also said that the healthcare sector in the US is undervalued relative to other defensive sectors. The sector, according to the report,  trades at a 17% discount to the average of staples and utilities forward P/E ratios.Story continuesMost Undervalued Healthcare Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsOur MethodologyFor this article, we scoured the Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds’ holdings and picked top 13 healthcare stocks with PE ratios (trailing or forward) under 15 as of February 22 with highest number of hedge fund investors.

The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors.Most Undervalued Healthcare Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds13. Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22California-based Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI) ranks 13th in our list of the most undervalued healthcare stocks to buy according to hedge funds.Insider Monkey’s database of elite hedge funds shows that 22 funds reported owning stakes in Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI) at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The biggest stakeholder of Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI) out of these funds was Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP which had a $39 million stake in the firm.In Q4, Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI)’s EPS came in at $0.35, surpassing estimates by $0.01. Revenue however fell 10.4% on a YoY basis to $204.7 million, missing estimates by $0.25 million.12. QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33California-based QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) makes diagnostics products. Recently, QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) posted strong Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.76, beating estimates by $0.34. Revenue in the period jumped about 36% on a YoY basis to reach $866.5 million, beating estimates by $90.69 million.QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) said that for 2023 it expects adjusted EPS in the range of $5.00-$5.60. The consensus estimate for this figure was $5.19. Revenue was expected to come in the range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion, versus the consensus estimate of $2.81 billion. QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) said that it expects to deliver high-single-digit top-line growth over the long term.A total of 33 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The total value of these stakes was $720 million. The biggest stakeholder of QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) during this period wasMeridian Funds made the following comment about QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) is a global leader in the diagnostics industry. The merger of Quidel and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics has resulted in a top 10 player in the in-vitro diagnostics industry, combining Quidel’s strong point of care platform with Ortho’s blood chemistry and transfusion platform. We believe the new company will be much more consistent in its ability to deliver steady top-line growth at attractive margins to fuel free cash flow growth. Further boosting our conviction in QuidelOrtho is its robust product pipeline. Pipeline developments include the company’s Savanna platform, which solves a long-term need for near-patient molecular testing that is accurate, fast, and economical. We believe the stock weakness is due to the anticipated decline in COVID-19 testing. However, we believe the long-term earnings and free cash flow profile are underappreciated, and as a result we increased our position in the stock.”11. BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) saw a jump in hedge fund sentiment during the fourth quarter, as Insider Monkey’s propritery database of 943 hedge fund holdings shows that 34 hedge funds ended the fourth quarter with BNTX in their portfolios, compared with 18 hedge funds in the previous quarter.

Over the past year, we trimmed our position significantly as we believed the stock’s valuation failed to reflect the windfall nature of COVID-19 vaccine cash flows. With the stock nearly 70% off its highs and, more importantly, at a reasonable discount to our PMV estimate, we view the valuation as opportunistic given its long-term profit cycle potential. BioNTech’s intellectual property in mRNA, and COVID funded manufacturing capacity leave it well-positioned to develop new mRNA vaccines and cancer therapies. In addition, the company has non-mRNA technology (e.g., cell therapy assets) and blue-chip partnerships offering additional optionality. While the company’s R&amp;D pipeline beyond COVID-19 vaccines will take some time to mature, it is well funded by close to $20 billion in COVID-vaccine proceeds. We increased our position within the GardenSM as the stock declined.”10. DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) is known for its kidney dialysis services. Insider Monkey database of 943 hedge fund holdings shows that 34 funds had invested in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, up from 30 hedge funds in the previous quarter. The total value of these stakes at the end of December 2022 was close to $3 billion.

Adjusted operating income in the quarter was $317 million.Some other notable stocks hedge funds are piling into from the healthcare sector include Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA). Moon Capital made the following comment about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)9.

(NYSE:AMN) (short), CBIZ Inc (short), Asana (short) and Palomar (short). AMN Healthcare Services provides workforce solutions and staffing services at healthcare facilities. An unstable healthcare employment environment is driving pricing and volume growth for contract labor, which we believe is unsustainable.”8. Organon &amp; Co.

Organon reported 2Q22 revenue of $1.59 billion, -0.6% Y/Y, ahead of consensus of $1.54 billion, and Adjusted EPS of $1.25, -27.3% Y/Y, in-line with analyst expectations.

Investors are concerned about legal liabilities associated with its antacid drug Zantac. While it is impossible to know the outcome with certainty, our preliminary assessment suggests that the decline in market capitalization exceeds the likely financial impact on the company.”6.

Meanwhile, one report estimates the government invested $900 million in pre-clinical research for multiple candidate vaccines.However, the authors of the study are also concerned with the public's return on investment.While mRNA vaccine doses are estimated to cost between $1-$3 apiece to manufacture, according to the researchers, Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA) and Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) recently announced plans to charge health insurance plans between $110-$130 per dose.Despite the significant public money investment, the U.S. paid Pfizer-BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX) $19.50/dose in 2020, $24 in 2021, and $30.48 in 2022 for the bivalent booster.Meanwhile, the U.S. paid Moderna $15.25 per dose for the first order and $26.36 in 2022.Moderna's CEO, Stéphane Bancel, will testify in March on its plans to raise the price of its COVID-19 vaccine in front of the Senate.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Most Profitable Biotech Stocks Today.The term ""biotechnology"" refers to the utilization of living organisms or biological systems to create solutions that address various agricultural, industrial, and health-related problems. The most well-known application of biotechnology is the use of genetic engineering to produce therapeutic proteins and other medications. Biotech's comparative advantage over Big Pharma is its increased return on investment. According to a Deloitte report, biotech firms can produce a return on R&amp;D of 9.3% as opposed to a 1.9% return for multinational pharmaceuticals.The biotechnology sector played a crucial role in the fight against COVID-19 in 2020. BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), a German biotechnology company, was responsible for the first COVID vaccine to receive FDA approval, which was later manufactured and marketed in partnership with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines by the biotech industry was a remarkable feat that garnered much attention and appreciation. This, in turn, led to a surge in investor interest, and the biotech IPO boom of 2020 and 2021 saw 158 companies going public.12 Most Profitable Biotech Stocks TodayPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashIn 2021, Venture Capitalists invested in 3,100 biotech startups, while the industry was able to raise a staggering amount of $34 billion globally. Additionally, according to EY, in 2021, the biotechnology industry's revenues were higher by 55% compared to 2016. However, much like other sectors, the biotech sector faced a slowdown in 2022 with low venture funding and a slowdown in number of IPOs as compared to 2021. Even the companies that did go public in 2022 ended up performing not particularly well, as reported by Crunchbase. However, in May 2022, McKinsey claimed that even after the downturn, the S&amp;P biotech index had delivered ten-year returns comparable to those of the S&amp;P 500 and higher than those of the S&amp;P pharmaceuticals index.Story continuesIn the agriculture sector, biotech aims to promote sustainable farming practices that also promise high yields. While in the industrial sector, biotech is being used to generate bio-fuels which are a cheaper alternative to fossil fuels. Several traditional pharma companies have diversified their operations to include biotechnology in their business. For example, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHBY) are pharmaceutical companies that have made significant investments in the biotechnology sector.Our MethodologyTo come up with the 12 most profitable biotech stocks today, we have sourced data from websites like Yahoo Finance to identify profitable biotech companies.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We established a position in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and selling medicines for patients in the therapeutic areas of oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, and neurology. The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo.At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”11. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Net Income TTM: $ 6.55 billionFounded in 1980, Amgen Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”10.

We like the company’s track record of innovation, and its diversified portfolio of drugs. However, we’ve become increasingly concerned about the outlook for some of its recently launched therapeutics, as well as some generic competition in a few of its mature drugs. If pressed, we still like the odds that Novartis will do well, but the outlook is a little cloudier than it’s been in a while. As noted above, we’ve been big fans of its Alcon unit for many years, and now that Alcon is independent, we decided to concentrate our investment there.”8.

Over the past year, we trimmed our position significantly as we believed the stock’s valuation failed to reflect the windfall nature of COVID-19 vaccine cash flows. With the stock nearly 70% off its highs and, more importantly, at a reasonable discount to our PMV estimate, we view the valuation as opportunistic given its long-term profit cycle potential. BioNTech’s intellectual property in mRNA, and COVID funded manufacturing capacity leave it well-positioned to develop new mRNA vaccines and cancer therapies. In addition, the company has non-mRNA technology (e.g., cell therapy assets) and blue-chip partnerships offering additional optionality. While the company’s R&amp;D pipeline beyond COVID-19 vaccines will take some time to mature, it is well funded by close to $20 billion in COVID-vaccine proceeds.

162,ea5f229a-1aac-37b7-9e64-99d71d1becc5,PFE,2023-03-04,Investors Heavily Search Pfizer Inc. (PFE): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-pfizer-inc-140002289.html,1677852002,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this drugmaker have returned -8.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.5% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Pfizer belongs, has lost 0.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $1.06 per share, indicating a change of -34.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.7% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.54 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -46.2%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.87 indicates a change of +9.4% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Pfizer.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PFE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $18.1 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -29.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $68.61 billion and $70.18 billion estimates indicate -31.6% and +2.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $24.29 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.9%. EPS of $1.14 for the same period compares with $1.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.2 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.36%. The EPS surprise was +10.68%.Over the last four quarters, Pfizer surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Fintech companies use technology to disrupt the traditional financial services sector, creating innovative solutions that increase efficiency and accessibility. This disruptive potential can lead to impressive growth, making it an attractive sector for investors with a more aggressive risk tolerance threshold.Such investors will certainly hope 2023 will be better than 2022, which saw fintech stocks waver. Payment stocks performed worse than the overall S&amp;P 500, which dropped more than 19%. That said, this disruptive sector promises better days.When investing in fintech growth stocks, as with all stocks, you must do your due diligence and research the companies you are considering. That means seeking companies with strong financials, solid growth potential, and a competitive edge in their niche.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are seven fintech growth stocks I think are worth diving deeper into.ADYYFAdyen$1,417.00MELIMercadoLibre$1,220.00FOURShift4 Payments$64.50GPNGlobal Payments$112.20TOSTToast$18.92PYPLPayPal$73.60FICOFair Isaac Corp.$677.39Adyen (ADYYF)Illustration of phone with dollar sign and other graphics symbolizing fintech displayed on and around it, with a blue backgroundSource: shutterstock.com/ZinetroNAdyen (OTCMKTS:ADYYF) is a global payment technology company offering a simplified platform to accept payments anywhere in the world. The company helps businesses increase revenue by providing customer payment solutions across multiple channels and devices. These solutions include a range of payment methods and currencies, as well as fraud prevention and data analysis tools to assist their customers.The company recently released its full fiscal year 2022 earnings results. Most metrics indicate that the company continues to experience strong overall growth, making it a reasonable investment.Adyen processed €767.5 billion of payments for the entire year, representing a 49% year-over-year increase. That resulted in €1.3 billion in total revenues, up 30% over the same period a year earlier.Story continuesAdyen noted solid growth in North America and Asia, and its shares carry several hundred dollars of upside beyond their current price. The company maintains hubs in Singapore, Chicago, San Francisco, Madrid, and Sao Paolo.MercadoLibre (MELI)MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comLatin American e-commerce company MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) provides various fintech offerings in Latin America. The company offers payment processing, digital wallets, and other financial services. Those services allow users to make payments, send money, and access credit in markets that may otherwise be under-served.The company and its fintech platform have become very popular in Latin America, where traditional banking services are less accessible. The company’s high-quality offerings have contributed to the its regional growth and success.Mercadolibre’s recent earnings report highlights the firm’s fintech success. Unique active users reached 44 million in the fourth quarter, representing a 27% increase year-over-year. MercadoLibre also rocessed $36 billion in total payment volume in Q4, a 45% increase over the same time frame. Notably, more than $25 billion of that volume was off-platform. The company’s POS (point of sale) business has expanded rapidly, with that $25 billion in payment volume representing 51% year-over-year growth.The company’s strong growth across an underserved Latin American payments landscape provides excellent upside to long-term investors.Shift4 Payments (FOUR)a person holding a smartphone over a check out scanner representing payments stocks to buySource: ShutterstockAnother up-and-coming fintech stock, Shift4 Payments (NYSE:FOUR) provides payment processing solutions and related services. The company’s offerings include contactless payments, gift cards, loyalty programs, and advanced security and fraud prevention tools. Shift4 Payments also offers a variety of software integrations to support businesses in a range of industries.FOUR stock has been relatively stable over the last year, price-wise, yet it still offers approximately 15% upside according to analysts.Shift4 Payments serves more than 200,000 current partners across the U.S., Canada, Japan, and Europe, processing over $200 billion of transactions annually.One of the more exciting developments from the company is its recent partnership with the self-checkout company Mashgin. Mashgin’s kiosks are equipped with computer vision-enabled cameras that allow users to place all their goods on kiosk trays and have them instantly rung up.Mashgin’s stadium kiosks have seen sales increases between 25%-400%, with the partnership promising to increase Shift4 Payments’ total processing volume substantially over the long-term.Global Payments (GPN)A concept image of mobile payment with a smart phone for a cup of coffee.Source: ShutterstockGlobal Payments (NYSE:GPN) provides similar offerings to the companies on this list. The company is a leading provider of a comprehensive suite of payment processing solutions and related services, including point-of-sale systems, online payments, and fraud prevention tools.But unlike the other shares listed above, GPN stock isn’t currently experiencing robust growth. Instead, 2022 revenues increased by a modest 5.2%, reaching $8.975 billion. It was more of the same in the fourth quarter, with the company posting only 2.7% year-over-year revenue growth. Fortunately, Global Payments’ net income grew by 19.1% to $258.56 million – a bright spot for the firm overall.However, Global Payments has a clear path toward growth with its acquisition of EVO Payments (NASDAQ:EVOP) expected to be completed by the end of March. That acquisition will increase the firm’s addressable markets and strengthen its current B2B payment solutions portfolio.Global Payments is shifting toward enterprise clients and away from consumer-focused businesses, with plans to divest two businesses soon.Toast (TOST)A close-up of a Toast (TOST) ordering screen.Source: TonelsonProductions / Shutterstock.comSome fintech stocks, including Toast (NYSE:TOST), also serve more niche areas of the fintech market. Toast is a cloud-based restaurant management platform that offers a variety of software and hardware solutions to support restaurant operations. Its solutions include point-of-sale systems, online ordering, and delivery management. The company serves a growing customer base domestically and internationally.Toast is fast becoming a household name within restaurant payments, posting 60% revenue growth in 2022. However, that impressive growth still did not propel Toast’s bottom line out of the red in 2022. The company posted a net loss of $275 million. The positive spin is that this net loss narrowed significantly from $487 million in 2021.Toast expects its $2.731 billion in 2022 revenues to grow to between $3.57 and $3.66 billion in 2023. That would represent top-line growth between 30.7% and 34%. The company also anticipates as much as $30 million in EBITDA, meaning it will still produce net losses in 2023 based on management’s expectations.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquartersDespite its size and prominent name, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) remains a noteworthy fintech growth stock to buy. It may be a pioneering name in the payments space, but that doesn’t mean it is a dinosaur that can’t keep up.It is more established than other names on this list. And as a consequence, it doesn’t boast the dramatic growth of several other stocks above. That said, PayPal reported meaningful Q4 and FY ’22 top-line growth of 7% and 8%, respectively.Of particular importance for fundamentals-based investors, PayPal’s earnings per share grew by 19% in Q4 after falling 41% in 2022. One interpretation of that metric is a reversal of negative momentum and a positive forward outlook.PYPL stock has proven volatile this year. It began 2023 trading at $74.58, rose to nearly $87 to start February, and has since fallen to $73. The positive is that analysts have pegged its target stock price above $99, so growth is certainly there.Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO)a pile of credit cardsSource: Teerasak Ladnongkhun/Shutterstock.comFair Isaac Corp. (NYSE:FICO) provides analytics software and tools. These solutions are utilized across the banking, insurance, and healthcare industries. Fair Issac provides credit risk assessment, fraud detection, and decision management. Most of us know Fair Isaac Corp. for the FICO credit score, determining individual and business creditworthiness.It’s also a fintech stock worth considering, underpinned by moderate growth. The company’s net income rose by 15% in Q4, reaching $97.6 million. Revenues grew by a more modest 6.98% during the same period.FICO will likely push fintech leaders to continue to define their AI strategies shortly. The company recently released its third annual State of Responsible AI in Financial Services report. The report notes an ongoing increase in demand for AI in fintech but a lack of transparency. Further, most companies surveyed have only vague notions of how to define and implement standards for AI across financial services.FICO could benefit from AI if it can improve the accuracy of the credit scores it assigns to individuals and businesses.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

He said the application process for the money is designed to prod companies to “express to us their vision for how we drive economic development, how we drive competitiveness, not just at a local level, not just at a state level, but at a regional level.”The funds come from about $53 billion put aside in the CHIPs and Science Act. The administration goal: achieving both a revitalization of the U.S. semiconductor industry— as well as broader political and economic goals that officials say will produce hundred of thousands of jobs in the U.S.One model? “I look to our experience in rebuilding and bringing back from the edge of complete collapse the city of Detroit,” Graves said, referencing his time during the Obama administration as the leader of the federal government’s efforts after the city filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy in 2013. He also mentioned a government-funded network of manufacturing innovation institutes called Manufacturing USA.But the question that remains is whether it’s possible to achieve these goals all at once. Already, some industry voices have reportedly been grumbling about the many restrictions on the money with others pointing out that the most successful projects historically have had limited instead of broader objectives.Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo speaks at the signing event for the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 at the White House on August 9. (REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein)The new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers; the application process opened this past week. An additional $11 billion is set to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design beginning later this year. The law also includes an investment tax credit of up to 25% towards a manufacturer’s capital expenditures.‘We're already a hub’Another point made by those who have a stake: these hubs already exist. Thus, they hope the money from Washington will primarily service as an amplifier—not only focus on new development.Story continuesFor example: In a Yahoo Finance Live interview this week, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) noted “we're already a hub for semiconductor manufacturing in the United States, this is just going to expand dramatically because of this legislation.”Intel (INTC) already has a strong presence in Kelly's state with 12,000 employees, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) recently announced plans there as well. For Kelly, a key point of the money is to help develop other companies around Intel and TSMC to help supply the giant fabrication plants to come with equipment, raw materials, and innovation in the years ahead.President Joe Biden walks with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company CEO C. C. Wei and Chairman Mark Liu during a visit to TSMC's planned Semiconductor Fabrication Plant in Arizona in December (REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)It's a similar situation about 2,500 miles away in upstate New York. IBM (IBM) and Micron (MU) are two of the big companies there. There has been years of semiconductor development in the region, which is also seen as a frontrunner for government money.But again, an official there is quick to point out that this area is far from starting from scratch with government money likely to boost what is already there. “Today, I'm talking with you from Albany NanoTech,” said Mukesh Khare, an IBM vice president, in an interview this week. Khare was also recently named to an Industrial Advisory Committee that is advising the Commerce department on the deployment of the law.The Albany Nanotech Complex is a public private partnership that has been growing for decades and was completed in 2015 as a host for a range of companies focused on semiconductor research at the SUNY Polytechnic Institute.Albany’s existing cluster makes good business sense, said Khare, and currently “serves the needs of companies who are here but expanding — with investment from places like CHIPS Act, the state, as well as private companies — will really have a multiplication effect.”The research facilties in New York could be paired with burgeoning manufacturing efforts. IBM recently announced a $20 billion manufacturing plan in nearby Poughkeepsie, N.Y. During an October visit, President Biden took credit for the expansion saying the CHIPs and Science act is “a law that’s going to build the future and a proud, proud legacy not only for IBM, but for the country.”In addition, Micron recently announced plans to invest up to $100 billion over the coming decades in Syracuse N.Y.President Joe Biden participates in a tour of an IBM semiconductor facility with CEO Arvind Krishna in Poughkeepsie, New York in October. (REUTERS/Tom Brenner)But Biden officials have repeatedly promised that no company or region is a shoo-in for the money. “The way that we've structured this and what we've been conveying to potential applicants throughout this process is that their expectation shouldn't be that we're giving a nod to any one area just simply because it already has a fab,” Deputy Secretary Graves said.Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo added “I expect there will be many disappointed companies"" and that her primary lens here ""is the achievement of our national security goals.”Aiming for ‘a win-win situation’The clusters to come will need to strike a balance between the financial imperatives of the semi-conductor sector and the Biden administration's larger policy goals.In addition to economic development, the Commerce Department has stressed that as a condition of applying for the money, companies will have to provide detailed financial information, not engage in stock buybacks with the money they get—and provide detailed workforce development plans down to the level of the childcare facilities they will provide.In a recent Yahoo Finance Live interview, Secretary Raimondo defended the restrictions and said that her goal is not to impose overly burdensome requirements. “We want to work in partnership with these companies.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Advocates of the multi-pronged goals said that the incentives can be aligned so that it’s beneficial to both the private and public sectors. Speaking of the childcare provisions this week, Sen. Kelly argued “This is a win-win situation, it helps families in Arizona and in other states that are going to have these companies there, but at the same time it helps the employer.”As for the timeline ahead, a Commerce official said the first awards will likely be for big fabrication plants - i.e., the anchors of the clusters to come. Deputy Secretary Graves said “we're hopeful that we'll be able to make our first awards by the end of the year, but it's going to depend on whether we get these strong, strategic-thinking applications.”IBM’s Khare added his praise of the government’s rollout so far and notes that, of course, ""we all want it to be much faster than where we are but, that said, it's a process and it needs to be fair and transparent and accountable so we are here to help.”Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

To skip our detailed analysis of the battery market, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Battery Manufacturers in the World. With the increasing shift towards electric vehicles (EVs), the global demand for batteries has seen major amounts of growth. According to the Wall Street Journal, the global sales of electric vehicles reached around 7.8 million which accounted for around 10% of the total auto sales for the year. The number of electric vehicles sold in 2022 saw a 68% increase from 2021 according to research from LMC Automotive and EV-Volumes.com. Meanwhile, the market share of electric vehicles was 11% of total car sales in Europe and 19% of total car sales in China. However, when plug-in hybrid vehicles which also have a small combustion engine are taken into account, the market share of electric vehicles in Europe increases to 20.3%. While the share of completely electric vehicles in the United States was lower at 5.8% in 2022, it was still a major jump from 3.2% in 2021.The increase in market share for electric vehicles is projected to continue. According to a report prepared by BloombergNEF, the market share of electric vehicles is projected to reach 40% by 2030. This rise is directly correlated with a projected increase in battery manufacturing. Atlas Public Policy has estimated that the investments in battery manufacturing in the United States alone reached $73 billion in 2022 which was three times as high as the investments in 2021. BloombergNEF also pointed out this trend in the rise of battery manufacturing, citing a 38% rise in battery manufacturing capacity since 2021.While the investments in battery manufacturing have been global, the market is still dominated by China. The New York Times estimates that China produces about 75% of all electric vehicle battery cells and does more refining of the major raw inputs than every other country in the world combined. It also had more electric vehicles sold than the rest of the world combined along with exports of electric vehicles rising to $3.2 billion in worth by November 2022. The country has 5 of the largest EV battery makers in the world according to market share.Story continuesThese battery manufacturers dominate the market, with the top 10 battery manufacturers accounting for more than 90% of the market share while the top 5 battery manufacturing companies account for around 75% of the total market share. According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the top six players in the cell manufacturing market will continue to dominate the market shares through 2030, when they will have a projected 61% market share despite a much larger market with more producers. The report also predicts that the total addressable market for batteries will grow to 2.8 TWh by 2030. While the production of batteries increases, it is also projected that battery prices will decrease due to the introduction of battery innovations that aim on reducing the costs of production via more efficient processes as well as cheaper outputs. Like other battery and automotive manufacturers such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), the battery manufacturers listed below are revolutionizing the automotive industry today.12 Biggest Battery Manufacturers in the Worldcharlotte-stowe-WkqHU1G2_sg-unsplashLet's now take a look at the 12 biggest battery manufacturers in the world. Our MethodologyIn order to shortlist these companies, we took a look at all the major battery manufacturing companies in the world.

172,29faab25-977a-3f20-8235-fdd857c27b5c,GM,2023-03-04,COLUMN-Automakers rush in where miners fear to tread: Andy Home,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-automakers-rush-where-miners-140342114.html,1677852222,STORY,"['HG=F', 'LAC', 'GM']","[By Andy HomeLONDON, March 3 (Reuters) - The race for electric vehicle (EV) battery metals is heating up.Automakers can't go green without having sufficient quantities of the lithium, nickel and cobalt that make the batteries work.Fear of missing out, quite literally, is generating an industry-wide shift to investing directly in the mining sector to ensure future supplies of the battery inputs.General Motors Co has announced a $650-million investment in Lithium Americas Corp to help fund development of the Thacker Pass project in Nevada.GM gets exclusive rights to 40,000 tonnes per year of lithium from a domestic mine, which is key to qualifying for the EV subsidies available under the Inflation Reduction Act.Carmakers have already been busy tying up supplies of battery metals under direct off-take agreements with existing metals producers.Now they are getting into the business of actually digging the mines, or at least helping with the finance.The investment rush has until now largely played out in the lithium sector but French-Italian carmaker Stellantis has just pivoted into copper with an investment in an Argentinian project.COPPER PIVOTStellantis, the third largest automotive group by sales, will pay $155 million for a 14.2% stake in McEwen Copper, a subsidiary of Canada's McEwen Mining, which owns the Los Azules project in Argentina.The deposit, ranked in the top 10 global undeveloped copper resources by Mining Intelligence, is expected to yield 100,000 tonnes per year of refined cathode from its anticipated start date in 2027.The automaker's investment comes with an option to purchase the mine's output at a ratio equivalent to its equity ownership.With the help of existing shareholder Nuton, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto, and its copper leaching technology, McEwen is aiming to make the mine carbon-neutral by 2038, adding to the project's green credentials.Copper is an often forgotten component of EV batteries, but it plays a critical role as a current collector. All battery chemistries require copper, albeit to varying degrees. Lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, a burgeoning part of the EV market, need around 50% more copper than nickel-manganese-cobalt, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).Story continuesOutside of the battery pack copper is also used in the electric motor, the busbar and in what can be up to a mile of internal wiring.The amount of copper used in a typical battery electric vehicle is 83 kilograms, compared with just 23 kilograms in an internal combustion vehicle, according to the International Copper Association.FEAR OF FALLING SHORTStellantis' leap upstream in the copper processing chain follows similar deals with Germany's Vulcan Energy for lithium and Australia's Element 25 for manganese.The copper investment has the same strategic rationale, one of ""ensuring strategic supplies of raw materials necessary for the success of the Company's global electrification plans"", to quote Stellantis.Automakers' collective move into the mining sector has so far largely prioritised the lithium sector, where Western companies have been playing catch-up with Chinese investors.Lithium supply is struggling to scale up at the speed required to meet accelerating demand from battery-makers. Even with a recent pullback in the spot Chinese market, the price of lithium carbonate has risen seven-fold since the start of 2021.Where lithium is today, copper could be tomorrow, if you believe Glencore, which has warned of a cumulative shortfall of 50 million tonnes by 2030 under the IEA's net zero emissions pathway.Imminent shortfall has been part and parcel of the copper narrative for many years, largely due to poor visibility on future project time-lines.However, this time could be different given the sector's chronic under-investment in new mine capacity. Producers have been collectively scarred by the experience of the 2000s, when they spent heavily on new mines only to see the copper price slide steadily lower over the first half of the 2010s.Capital expenditure in the sector slumped, miners opting to return cash to shareholders rather than dig more big copper mines. It hasn't recovered despite the pick-up in the copper price from a cycle low of $4,318 per tonne in 2016 to $9,000.Current guidance ""points toward 34% less growth capex deployed in nominal terms between 2022-2026 than was deployed over the same time frame during the early-mid 2000's,"" according to Goldman Sachs. (""Copper: The end of surplus"", Dec. 6, 2022).If copper producers remain too wary of investing in future supply growth, automotive capital may be the answer. It is already a key enabler in the build-out of lithium, nickel and manganese production capacity.BACK TO THE FUTUREThe automotive sector is driving back to the future, the new rush to take control of supply chains an echo of Henry Ford, who famously bought iron and steel operations to supply the iconic River Rouge complex in Dearborn, Michigan.Ford's ambition to own the full automotive supply chain from mine to product was driven by the raw material shortages created by the first world war.The company's modern-day successors are faced with the same raw materials shortfall across the battery metals spectrum. If they could have sourced their metals using their favoured horizontal supply chain model, they would have done.But so intense is the competition for battery metals and so entrenched the dominant Chinese operators that Western automotive companies have little choice but to invest directly in the next generation of supply projects.However, the move upstream comes with plenty of potential pitfalls.Greenfield mines have a history of running late and over budget, particularly when they are experimenting with new processing technology such as is being deployed at many lithium projects.It's worth remembering that Henry Ford's vertical integration model wasn't always successful.The Brazilian rubber plantations, intended to supply latex for tire production, were plagued by poor yields and bad relations with the local workforce. It didn't help that Ford initially insisted on a Midwestern diet and participation in events such as square-dancing.However, even after the rules were relaxed and the operations transferred to a more promising site, Ford's Brazilian dreams were overtaken by the invention of synthetic rubber.Ford ended up selling the assets back to the Brazilian government for just $250,000 without having achieved a commercially viable operation.It's a useful reminder that going upstream can be a high-risk business for even the biggest automotive companies.The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.

He’ll also be featured on planes and even the tarmac.""Every airline burns jet fuel to run their business, but no airline will solve climate change on its own,” said Josh Earnest, United’s chief communications officer in a statement. “So United has enlisted Oscar to help us educate the traveling public of all ages about SAF and rally them to the cause of fighting climate change. From banana peels to fryer grease, Oscar is uniquely qualified to help us explain why trash could be the treasure that fuels the jets of the future.""SAF is made largely from recycled food and agricultural waste, and cuts greenhouse emissions by 80% compared to the more frequently used jet fuel. However, it costs up to eight time as much as typical fuel, which is why airlines have been slow to adopt it. By 2030, the industry has vowed to use SAF for 10% of its global fuel supply. (United has vowed to be “100% green” by 2050, eliminating all greenhouse gas emissions without relying on carbon offsets.)Earlier this year, the head of London’s Heathrow Airport suggested increasing fares for the wealthiest of travelers to cover the costs of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), sparing less wealthy passengers the cost.United hopes that future SAF can be made from things like household trash or forest waste. To date, the carrier has invested in the future production of over three billion gallons of SAF, which it says is more than any other airline.Story continuesThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeHow to save $750 a month, according to financial advisersThe 10 best high yield savings accounts for March 2023This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

Earnings reports this week from Best Buy, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and others showed major improvement in inventory levels — setting the stage for better profit margins later in 2023 (provided the economy doesn't tank).Story continuesA few notable retailers this week that showed 4Q inventory declines year over year:Target: -3% (more on the quarter here from CFO Michael Fiddelke)Abercrombie &amp; Fitch: -4% (more on the quarter here from CEO Fran Horowitz)Best Buy: -14%Nordstrom: -15.2%Key quote on retailer inventory:“Everybody has a (fight) plan until they get punched in the face”. That is a quote attributed to former boxing champ Mike Tyson, which we believe is helpful to keep in mind as we assess retailers’ fight to get inventories clean. Now that we are 70% through the retail earnings season, it is a good time to check on the progress retailers/brands are making. The data are mixed, though we believe the news is more good than bad, as many retailers are making progress consistent with their plan of getting inventory growth more inline with sales growth. But given that sales growth is a moving target, Mike Tyson’s words of wisdom might suggest (which we believe is relevant to the current situation) ‘what if retailers get punched in the face with sales growth that is below forecast."" — Citi retail analyst Paul LejuezTesla Investor Day = Flop, Kind Of?The EV maker's hotly anticipated investor day left much to be desired, reports Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian.No introduction of a new $25,000 car.

Most retailers painting a cautious forecast over consumer sentiment. This even as strong buying continues. Target earnings beat estimates with same store sales increasing by 7/10 of a percent. That was higher than what Wall Street had been expecting. They were expecting a decline of about 1.7%. The company crediting strength in food, beauty, and household essentials. Costco reported a mixed quarter. Revenue coming in just a bit light here, but the company's CEO saying that there was weakness here in big ticket discretionary items, a headwind there for Costco.We also heard from Lowe's, which warned of the cautious consumer after issuing a softer than expected outlook. Obviously, higher prices, inflation a huge headwind here for all of these retail names. And Costco's earnings call, after the bell yesterday, inflation was mentioned by their CFO numerous times. In total, on the call, it was mentioned over 30 times. Just really points to the fact that higher prices is such an issue here for a number of those retailers. And we talk about people trading down. Their Kirkland brand is doing very, very well, and the sales penetration there increasing just about 1 and 1/2%. So, Costco's weathering the storm, but they look pretty well positioned here going forward.DAVE BRIGGS: If I take one pattern out of this week, it's private label brands. You mentioned Kirkland. Target saw very much success in the private labels, as well as cosmetics. We talked about that a lot. Blue Mercury had a great quarter, and Target saw a great cosmetics number. But you mentioned the buzzword, which, really, we saw from every retailer-- ""cautious consumer."" When we heard from the bank CEOs early in earnings, they talked about a mild recession. The buzzword in retail was a cautious consumer where they are beginning to trade down. I think we'll hear a lot more about that.]"

(NASDAQ:ADI) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices Analog Devices Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Vice President of Global Operations &amp; Technology, Vivek Jain, sold US$2.3m worth of shares at a price of US$166 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$186). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 43% of Vivek Jain's stake.Analog Devices insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Analog Devices better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Analog Devices Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Analog Devices shares. In total, insiders dumped US$3.7m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Analog Devices Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Analog Devices insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$314m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Analog Devices Tell Us?Insiders sold Analog Devices shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since Analog Devices is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example - Analog Devices has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

187,000e9f92-e5cd-3a62-96b2-d9861c0b95f9,RF,2023-03-04,There's A Lot To Like About Regions Financial's (NYSE:RF) Upcoming US$0.20 Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/theres-lot-regions-financials-nyse-122038715.html,1677932438,STORY,"['RF', 'RF-PC']","[Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Regions Financial's shares on or after the 9th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 4th of April.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.20 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.80 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Regions Financial stock has a trailing yield of around 3.4% on the current share price of $23.35. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Regions Financial's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Regions Financial If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately Regions Financial's payout ratio is modest, at just 32% of profit.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. For this reason, we're glad to see Regions Financial's earnings per share have risen 18% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Regions Financial has delivered an average of 35% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Regions Financial? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business. This strategy can add significant value to shareholders over the long term - as long as it's done without issuing too many new shares. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating Regions Financial more closely.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Regions Financial is facing. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for Regions Financial that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) share price is up 56% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 34% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 9.6% in the last year , including dividends .So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Marriott International There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Marriott International achieved compound earnings per share growth of 26% per year. The average annual share price increase of 16% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Marriott International has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Marriott International will grow revenue in the future.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Marriott International shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 9.6% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 5% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Marriott International better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Marriott International   you should know about.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

But despite the widespread complaining about high inflation, one of the sectors that continued to show resilience was travel and tourism. Several reports show that consumers are continuing to spend on travel and entertainment despite inflation worries.Luxury and wealth research firm Altiant in a report mentions a detailed survey which shows that wealthy Americans prefer to spend more on experiences instead of things.Altiant conducted a survey of 1,200 of affluent travels across Asia, Europe and the Americas during the second half of 2022. The survey’s results show that about 60% of the individuals in question planned to spend more on travel in 2023.“People are Prioritizing Travel Over Just About Everything”The increase in travel demand is not just driven by the rich. Expedia’s management, after revealing weak Q4 results, said that the company is continuing to see that “people are prioritizing travel over just about everything.” Expedia’s CFO said in the company’s Q4 earnings call that so far the demand is “quite robust” and the company is “pleased” to see the upbeat start to 2023.In this backdrop, it would be interesting to see which hotel stocks are undervalued and how the smart money is piling into them for future returns.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Large-Cap Stocks Hedge Funds Are Dumping.We are now approaching the end of the first quarter of 2023 and the markets are exhibiting an upward trend. As of March 3, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 5.58% year to date and the Nasdaq has shot up by 12.40% since the beginning of the year. After the disastrous year that 2022 was for the stock market, seeing these upward moves can make one wonder whether these moves are just short-term spikes or if they are the real deal.Morgan Stanley's Senior Vice President: ""We Think The Bear Market Is Not Over""On February 27 Morgan Stanley's senior vice president and portfolio manager, Katerina Simonetti, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance Live where she discussed her view of the markets and what she sees moving forward. Simonetti noted that 2022 was centered around ""inflation and Fed action, and markets ""underestimated inflation"" so ""now we're seeing the results of that"". Simonetti further spoke about the Fed's hiking cycle and said that since ""economic data surprised us to the positive"", the central bank is expected to continue its hiking cycle. Here are some comments from Katerina Simonetti of Morgan Stanley:""As we continue to focus on the Fed, in our view, the focus should be on the earnings revisions. Because that's where the real story for '23, in our view, is the fact that it was easier to be profitable during the times of the high inflation and as inflation is coming down, these profit margins are harder to find.""Simonetti noted that U.S. companies ""specifically are going to be revising their earnings and setting them to the more normal level"". The earnings revisions ""to the more normal level"" are going to be ""viewed by the market as a negative, as it should be"" said Simonetti, and ""this is what is really underestimated by the general investing public"". Simonetti thinks that ""there is a lot of risk in this market, and that the risk-reward is just not there"". Katerina Simonetti said that ""earnings have a long way to go"" and ""stocks seem highly overvalued"". Simonetti further said that ""another leg down"" is necessary ""to pivot our way into the next bull market"" since ""the bear market is not over"".Story continuesKaterina Simonetti said she does not think that ""there are not opportunities in this market"". Simonetti likes ""high-quality dividend-paying stocks"" in the healthcare, financials, and utilities sectors and more specifically, she likes the ""combination of blue-chip dividend-paying stocks plus higher-yielding bonds"" in the current market environment. Finally, Simonetti said that though technology outperformed all other sectors in the last bull market, she thinks ""this might not be the leading sector in the next bull market"".Hedge funds are some of the biggest players in the stock market, with their decisions potentially having a large impact on the market.

Recently, the company expanded through the acquisition of Allergan, which added robust growth assets to help offset the loss of U.S. patent protection for Humira, a leading treatment used for rheumatology, dermatology. gastroenterology, and ophthalmology. While AbbVie reported weak third quarter revenues across the board, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vraylar (an antipsychotic treatment) in December. Despite concerns around Humira’s loss of patent protection, we believe AbbVie has significantly diversified its revenue and that its launch of Rinvog for psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis could be promising.”11.

We sold our position at that time due to heightened risk associated with operations in Kazakhstan, which sends oil through a pipeline that runs through Russia out to the Black Sea. When Russia invaded Ukraine, we believed there was real risk that something would happen to inhibit Chevron’s ability to get that oil to the market. We didn’t believe that risk was reflected in the stock price, so we sold our position. Today, 10+ months into the Ukraine crisis, more information has become available regarding the Kazakhstan operations, and the associated risks are now well-known. We believe those risks are fully priced into the current stock valuation. Chevron is one of the best operators in its field, with a diversified portfolio and strong management, and we took the opportunity to reinvest when the stock was trading below our estimate of intrinsic value.”8.

(NYSE:JPM) and has a position worth $643.1 million in the company.Here is what Vltava Fund had to say about JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term.JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008.A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.”7.

Azure now represents nearly 25% of the total business and continues to compound at a higher rate. Although growth is moderating a bit recently (as it is for AWS and Google Cloud Platform as well), these three platforms collectively generated more than $140 billion in revenue during the last 12 months and are still growing at a healthy rate. Further, Microsoft Cloud, or commercial cloud (which includes Azure and other cloud services, Office 365 Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties) continues to grow roughly 30% and is now about half the business. Mathematically, commercial cloud could decelerate to 20% growth with all other segments decelerating to zero growth and total company revenue growth would still be at least double digits. We believe Microsoft is positioned to compound underlying earnings per share at a midteens rate over the next five years. At 22x earnings, we felt the valuation was attractive and that it should be a large position.”6. NextEra Energy, Inc.

(NYSE:TPR) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Tapestry's shares before the 9th of March to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 27th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.30 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.20 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Tapestry has a trailing yield of 2.7% on the current share price of $44.47. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for Tapestry Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Tapestry paid out a comfortable 32% of its profit last year. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Tapestry generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Over the last year it paid out 52% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Fortunately for readers, Tapestry's earnings per share have been growing at 11% a year for the past five years. Tapestry is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Tapestry's dividend payments are broadly unchanged compared to where they were 10 years ago.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Tapestry for the upcoming dividend? From a dividend perspective, we're encouraged to see that earnings per share have been growing, the company is paying out less than half of its earnings, and a bit over half its free cash flow. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces.

Earnings reports this week from Best Buy, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and others showed major improvement in inventory levels — setting the stage for better profit margins later in 2023 (provided the economy doesn't tank).Story continuesA few notable retailers this week that showed 4Q inventory declines year over year:Target: -3% (more on the quarter here from CFO Michael Fiddelke)Abercrombie &amp; Fitch: -4% (more on the quarter here from CEO Fran Horowitz)Best Buy: -14%Nordstrom: -15.2%Key quote on retailer inventory:“Everybody has a (fight) plan until they get punched in the face”. That is a quote attributed to former boxing champ Mike Tyson, which we believe is helpful to keep in mind as we assess retailers’ fight to get inventories clean. Now that we are 70% through the retail earnings season, it is a good time to check on the progress retailers/brands are making. The data are mixed, though we believe the news is more good than bad, as many retailers are making progress consistent with their plan of getting inventory growth more inline with sales growth. But given that sales growth is a moving target, Mike Tyson’s words of wisdom might suggest (which we believe is relevant to the current situation) ‘what if retailers get punched in the face with sales growth that is below forecast."" — Citi retail analyst Paul LejuezTesla Investor Day = Flop, Kind Of?The EV maker's hotly anticipated investor day left much to be desired, reports Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian.No introduction of a new $25,000 car.

Just a lot of droning on by the world's richest person, Elon Musk.Tesla shares finished the week down about 3% compared to a slight gain for the S&amp;P 500.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas — a long-time Tesla bull — did his best hype job post the company's investor day.""Tesla's audacious efforts on vertical integration are about to pay off.

While we are unable to comment on any pending license requests, we work with customers and partners worldwide to comply with all applicable export controls and meet market demand.”A senior State Department Official said the document was a preliminary draft prepared by a contractor, and the department ""would not have approved of the report in its current form."" It also said the government ""has written and contracted multiple reports on this subject, based on different contingencies, which arrive at very different conclusions.""The White House and Commerce Department declined to comment. Huawei did not respond to a request for comment.The document shows the Biden administration is seeking to assess the impact on U.S. companies of proposed Huawei policy changes before imposing new rules that could crimp projected revenue streams at a time when the tech industry is already reeling. It also provides unusual insight into the politically sensitive question of which U.S. companies are seeking business ties to Huawei, one of Washington's most penalized Chinese companies.Story continuesReuters could not learn the details of the specific policy change whose impact was being assessed in the report.The report suggested Qualcomm would likely suffer a ""moderate economic impact"" from the change in policy, in contrast to Huawei. Indeed, the loss of access to Qualcomm's modem chips would have a bigger impact on Huawei, the report forecast, since Huawei ""relies heavily on Qualcomm's modem chips to support its smart phone offering.""Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment.Reuters reported in 2021 that U.S. officials had approved license applications worth hundreds of millions of dollars for Huawei to buy chips for its growing auto component business, including vehicle components such as video screens and sensors, as trade restrictions crippled other business lines.Huawei was placed on the ""entity list"" in 2019 amid fears it could spy on Americans and allegations it was stealing intellectual property and violating sanctions. The U.S requires that suppliers seek a special license that is usually denied when selling U.S. goods to companies on the list. But the Trump administration instituted a more lenient policy for Huawei, blocking its access to 5G chips but allowing other items like 4G chips to be shipped to the firm.The Commerce Department's top export controls official, Alan Estevez, said this week the Trump-era policy allowing U.S. technology below the “5G level"" to be shipped to Huawei was ""under assessment.""But sources say there are differences within the administration odds over how far to go: some officials advocate blocking all licenses to Huawei suppliers and revoking existing authorizations, while others want to extend restrictions only to 4G chips and other targeted technologies going forward.(Reporting by Alexandra Alper; Additional Reporting by Karen Freifeld and Stephen Nellis; Editing by Chris Sanders and William Mallard)]"

(NYSE:TRV) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smart-buy-travelers-companies-inc-121854163.html,1677932334,STORY,['TRV'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Travelers Companies' shares on or after the 9th of March, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 31st of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.93 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$3.72 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Travelers Companies has a trailing yield of 2.0% on the current share price of $183.59. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Travelers Companies If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Travelers Companies paying out a modest 31% of its earnings.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see Travelers Companies's earnings per share have risen 10% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Travelers Companies has delivered an average of 7.3% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpIs Travelers Companies worth buying for its dividend? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business. This strategy can add significant value to shareholders over the long term - as long as it's done without issuing too many new shares. Overall, Travelers Companies looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.In light of that, while Travelers Companies has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. To help with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Travelers Companies that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

212,b64b66e3-cc63-3818-9994-15307d6bf28b,CHRW,2023-03-04,Returns on Capital Paint A Bright Future For C.H. Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-paint-bright-future-140608835.html,1677852368,STORY,['CHRW'],"[What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of C.H. Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW) we really liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on C.H. Robinson Worldwide is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.50 = US$1.3b ÷ (US$6.0b - US$3.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, C.H. Robinson Worldwide has an ROCE of 50%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Logistics industry average of 12%. Check out our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide roceIn the above chart we have measured C.H. Robinson Worldwide's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is C.H. Robinson Worldwide's ROCE Trending?C.H. Robinson Worldwide's ROCE growth is quite impressive. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 44% in that same time. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.Story continuesOn a side note, C.H. Robinson Worldwide's current liabilities are still rather high at 56% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.In Conclusion...To bring it all together, C.H. Robinson Worldwide has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 24% to shareholders. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.C.H. Robinson Worldwide does come with some risks though, we found 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those makes us a bit uncomfortable...High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Large-Cap Stocks Hedge Funds Are Dumping.We are now approaching the end of the first quarter of 2023 and the markets are exhibiting an upward trend. As of March 3, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 5.58% year to date and the Nasdaq has shot up by 12.40% since the beginning of the year. After the disastrous year that 2022 was for the stock market, seeing these upward moves can make one wonder whether these moves are just short-term spikes or if they are the real deal.Morgan Stanley's Senior Vice President: ""We Think The Bear Market Is Not Over""On February 27 Morgan Stanley's senior vice president and portfolio manager, Katerina Simonetti, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance Live where she discussed her view of the markets and what she sees moving forward. Simonetti noted that 2022 was centered around ""inflation and Fed action, and markets ""underestimated inflation"" so ""now we're seeing the results of that"". Simonetti further spoke about the Fed's hiking cycle and said that since ""economic data surprised us to the positive"", the central bank is expected to continue its hiking cycle. Here are some comments from Katerina Simonetti of Morgan Stanley:""As we continue to focus on the Fed, in our view, the focus should be on the earnings revisions. Because that's where the real story for '23, in our view, is the fact that it was easier to be profitable during the times of the high inflation and as inflation is coming down, these profit margins are harder to find.""Simonetti noted that U.S. companies ""specifically are going to be revising their earnings and setting them to the more normal level"". The earnings revisions ""to the more normal level"" are going to be ""viewed by the market as a negative, as it should be"" said Simonetti, and ""this is what is really underestimated by the general investing public"". Simonetti thinks that ""there is a lot of risk in this market, and that the risk-reward is just not there"". Katerina Simonetti said that ""earnings have a long way to go"" and ""stocks seem highly overvalued"". Simonetti further said that ""another leg down"" is necessary ""to pivot our way into the next bull market"" since ""the bear market is not over"".Story continuesKaterina Simonetti said she does not think that ""there are not opportunities in this market"". Simonetti likes ""high-quality dividend-paying stocks"" in the healthcare, financials, and utilities sectors and more specifically, she likes the ""combination of blue-chip dividend-paying stocks plus higher-yielding bonds"" in the current market environment. Finally, Simonetti said that though technology outperformed all other sectors in the last bull market, she thinks ""this might not be the leading sector in the next bull market"".Hedge funds are some of the biggest players in the stock market, with their decisions potentially having a large impact on the market. It can be especially insightful to look where smart money is placing its bets. However, looking at stocks that hedge funds are dumping can potentially save retail investors from short-term volatility and potential losses.

Recently, the company expanded through the acquisition of Allergan, which added robust growth assets to help offset the loss of U.S. patent protection for Humira, a leading treatment used for rheumatology, dermatology. gastroenterology, and ophthalmology. While AbbVie reported weak third quarter revenues across the board, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vraylar (an antipsychotic treatment) in December. Despite concerns around Humira’s loss of patent protection, we believe AbbVie has significantly diversified its revenue and that its launch of Rinvog for psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis could be promising.”11.

Payment volume grew 21% in local currency (excluding Russia) as consumer spending remained resilient and the international travel recovery continued as border restrictions were lifted.

We sold our position at that time due to heightened risk associated with operations in Kazakhstan, which sends oil through a pipeline that runs through Russia out to the Black Sea. When Russia invaded Ukraine, we believed there was real risk that something would happen to inhibit Chevron’s ability to get that oil to the market. We didn’t believe that risk was reflected in the stock price, so we sold our position. Today, 10+ months into the Ukraine crisis, more information has become available regarding the Kazakhstan operations, and the associated risks are now well-known. We believe those risks are fully priced into the current stock valuation. Chevron is one of the best operators in its field, with a diversified portfolio and strong management, and we took the opportunity to reinvest when the stock was trading below our estimate of intrinsic value.”8.

(NYSE:JPM) to Hold from Buy and lowered his price target on the shares to $145 from $155.As of December 31, Greenhaven Associates is the leading shareholder in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) and has a position worth $643.1 million in the company.Here is what Vltava Fund had to say about JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term.JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008.A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.”7. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 259Number of Hedge Funds That Sold: 10On February 24, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives raised his price target on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to $290 from $280 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. As of March 2, the stock has lost 16.74% over the past 12 months.10 hedge funds dissolved their positions in the company in Q4 2022. The stock was held by 259 hedge funds at the close of Q4 2022. The total stakes of these hedge funds amounted to $58.65 billion, down from $61.17 billion in the preceding quarter with 269 positions.As of December 31, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the most prominent investor in the company and owns more the 39.2 million shares of the company.Here is what Polen Capital had to say about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“In the case of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), the company is performing very well. Azure now represents nearly 25% of the total business and continues to compound at a higher rate. Although growth is moderating a bit recently (as it is for AWS and Google Cloud Platform as well), these three platforms collectively generated more than $140 billion in revenue during the last 12 months and are still growing at a healthy rate. Further, Microsoft Cloud, or commercial cloud (which includes Azure and other cloud services, Office 365 Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties) continues to grow roughly 30% and is now about half the business. Mathematically, commercial cloud could decelerate to 20% growth with all other segments decelerating to zero growth and total company revenue growth would still be at least double digits. We believe Microsoft is positioned to compound underlying earnings per share at a midteens rate over the next five years. At 22x earnings, we felt the valuation was attractive and that it should be a large position.”6. NextEra Energy, Inc.

Unfortunately for Wall Street, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index came in hotter than economists anticipated. In turn, this dynamic suggests that the Federal Reserve may raise the benchmark interest rate to combat stubbornly high inflation.Fundamentally, the best utility stocks to buy shield investors from significant volatility because of their underlying natural monopoly. According to Investopedia, “[a] natural monopoly is a type of monopoly that exists typically due to the high start-up costs or powerful economies of scale of conducting a business in a specific industry which can result in significant barriers to entry for potential competitors.”What makes the below names of the best utility stocks to buy stand out is that they enjoy a combination of relatively strong upside price targets with passive income. Now, the degree to which investors receive either attribute will vary. However, I provided a diversity of ideas so that you can pick what works best for your portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSOSouthern Co.$63.55EXCExelon Corp.$40.72XELXcel Energy$64.72WECWEC Energy$89.24AWKAmerican Water Works$140.61WTRGEssential Utilities$42.90CEGConstellation Energy$74.95Southern Co. (SO)the southern company logo displayed several times on a screenSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Southern Co. (NYSE:SO) is a gas and electric utility holding company. Per its public profile, it’s the second-largest utility in terms of the customer base as of 2021. Through its subsidiaries, it serves nine million gas and electric utility customers in six states. In the trailing year, SO stock slipped 0.32%.For passive income, Southern features a robust forward yield of 4.29%. This hits higher than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. As well, the company commands 21 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Certainly, this will be a status that management will want to keep going.Story continuesAccording to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), SO rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, the company features solid operational attributes. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 10%, above 66.3% of the competition. Also, its net margin is 12.08%, also above 66% of the field. Currently, Wall Street analysts peg SO as a consensus hold. However, their average price target ($70.40) implies 9% upside potential. Thus, SO makes for a balanced example of the best utility stocks to buy.Exelon (EXC)The logo for Exelon (EXC) is visible at the top of an office building.Source: photosounds / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) is the largest electric parent company in the U.S., per its public profile. Presently, it features approximately 10 million regulated electric utility customers. Since the January opener, EXC slipped over 4%. In the trailing year, shares gave up nearly 3% of equity value.On the passive income front, Exelon offers a decent showing, posting a forward yield of 3.48%. Although it’s a bit below the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%, the company features a payout ratio of 57.45%. That affords the yield a bit more confidence and credibility. To be fair, though, Exelon only features one year of dividend increases. As for its financials, Exelon is currently working through the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. However, it did manage to post a trailing-year net margin of 11.37%. This stat ranks above 62.53% of the competition.Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg EXC as a consensus moderate buy. In addition,  their average price target stands at $46.30, implying 12% upside potential. Thus, it makes a solid case for the best utility stocks to buy.Xcel Energy (XEL)close-up of Xcel Energy (XCEL) logo in black and red displayed on smartphone screenSource: shutterstock.com/rafapressBased in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) is a regulated electric utility and natural gas delivery firm. Per its corporate profile, the company serves more than 3.7 million electric customers and 2.1 million natural gas customers across parts of eight states. Since the Jan. opener, XEL declined by 6%. In the trailing year, it’s underwater to the tune of 2%.Still, XEL might be a solid discount among the best utility stocks to buy. For passive income, the company carries a forward yield of 3.16%. While it’s a bit under the sector average, Xcel commands 20 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. As well, its payout ratio of 57.6% is relatively manageable.Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculations, XEL rates as modestly undervalued. As well, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 8.1%, above 60.75% of the competition. Also, its net margin pings at 11.34%, outpacing 62% of its peers. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg XEL as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $73.75, implying 12% upside potential. Thus, it’s well worth considering the best utility stocks to buy.WEC Energy (WEC)WEC Energy Group logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comCalling Milwaukee, Wisconsin home, WEC Energy (NYSE:WEC) is a leading Midwest electric and natural gas holding company with subsidiaries serving 4.6 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota. Since the January opener, WEC gave up over 3% of its equity value. However, in the trailing year, it managed to poke its head barely above breakeven.Still, with investor fears rising about the Fed’s future monetary policy strategy, WEC may rank among the best utility stocks to buy. For passive income, the company carries a forward yield of 3.43%. That’s almost in line with the sector’s average yield. As well, it’s on a 19-year streak regarding consecutive annual dividend increases. So close to 20 years, management won’t give up this payout without a fight.According to Gurufocus.com, WEC rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, the utility features a three-year revenue growth rate of 8.5%, outpacing 62.53% of the field. Its net margin almost touches 15%, which beats out 75% of its rivals. Finally, covering analysts peg WEC as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $102.40, implying 12.5% upside potential. Therefore, it’s another balanced example of the best utility stocks to buy.American Water Works (AWK)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comA public utility firm, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) provides water and wastewater services in the U.S. Per its public profile, the company provides these services to approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states. It serves a total of approximately 14 million customers. Since the Jan. opener, AWK fell more than 8%, indicating a higher risk profile. For the trailing year, it’s down 6.3%.Objectively, AWK may require patience. For instance, it trades at a trailing multiple of 31.39, which ranks on the high side. Further, the relevance of its water business should keep the machinery going. As evidence, its net margin stands at 21.62%, outpacing 87.58% of the competition. In terms of passive income, AWK sits a bit on the modest side, with a forward yield of 1.85%. However, the company enjoys 13 years of consecutive dividend increases. In addition, its payout ratio of 50.93% indicates confidence in its sustainability.Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg AWK as a consensus hold. However, their average price target stands at $162.20, implying almost 15% upside potential. Thus, it can make up ground in the capital gains department, making it one of the best utility stocks to buy for rising rates.Essential Utilities (WTRG)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA utility firm with stakes in Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia, Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) provides drinking water and wastewater treatment infrastructure and services. As with American Water Works, Essential Utilities features a higher-risk profile. Since the beginning of Jan., WTRG slipped nearly 8%. For the trailing year, it’s down almost 6%.Still, contrarian investors may consider WTRG as one of the best utility stocks to buy for rising rates. Per Gurufocus.com, WTRG rates as modestly undervalued. Operationally, the company really comes to life. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 15.7%, ranking better than 80.49% of the field. On the bottom line, its net margin stands at 22.04%, outpacing over 88% of sector rivals.Regarding passive income, WTRG doesn’t provide the most generous rate with a forward yield of 2.59%. Still, it’s something. As well, Essential commands 31 years of consecutive dividend increases. To boot, its payout ratio is just under 56%, which is reasonable for the industry. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg WTRG as a unanimous strong buy. As well, their average price target stands at $53.25, implying 20% upside potential. Folks, this might be the leader of best utility stocks to buy for rising rates.Constellation Energy (CEG)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG) is the nation’s largest producer of carbon-free energy and provides sustainable solutions to homes, businesses, and public-sector customers across the continental U.S. It takes a while to get through the word salad but Constellation specializes in nuclear energy.Now, from a year-to-date perspective, CEG might seem like a losing proposition, shedding over 3% of equity value. However, in the past 365 days, CEG gained a whopping 72%. That might seem challenging in terms of passive income and you’d be right. Per TipRanks, its dividend yield sits at 0.71% at the time of writing.To be fair, the company could also shore up its financials. While it features strong revenue growth, its net margin slipped into negative territory on a trailing-year basis. Still, for those who want to speculate on their best utility stocks to buy, CEG could be intriguing. Right now, analysts peg shares as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $97.60, implying over 23% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

However, there is another key element of the issue that is too often ignored: the digital skills gap.Earlier this week, the National Skills Coalition (NSC) released a report in conjunction with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on the task at hand and what it means to close the digital skills divide in the workforce.Here are the key numbers:92%92% of jobs available today require digital or likely digital skills - yet nearly one-third of US workers lack opportunities to build these skills.23%Jobs that require even one digital skill can earn an average of 23% more than jobs requiring no digital skills - an increase of $8,000 in annual income.$27KBusinesses can save more than $27,000 per position when they offer upskilling opportunities, versus the cost of replacing a worker who departs.What does this report tell us?Across every industry and firm size, the US labor market shows an incredible demand for digital skills and workforce development. This is the reality we face today - not a projection of where jobs will be in the future. When we close the digital skills divide, we can create big payoffs for individuals, businesses, and the overall economy.What should we do?The answer lies in partnerships. Both the public and private sectors must work together to equip workers with digital skills. These skills must be both fundamental, like using a computer, and industry specific, like using bookkeeping software.Story continuesWith an unprecedented federal investment in broadband deployment and adoption, there is no better time for government, private companies, and community organizations to collaborate.Policymakers can use federal Digital Equity Act and Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) funds to supercharge free or low-cost digital skills training programs. Such programs include Digital Navigators, in which local experts help folks understand the importance of digital skills and how to access available resources, like the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). Across the nation at Comcast, we've launched a network of Digital Navigators who are breaking down barriers to digital literacy and helping more people get and stay online.As these federal funds are distributed, we have a special opportunity to bring digital skills resources to the communities that need them the most. This includes workers of color as well as small businesses and education providers, many of which rely on publicly funded programs to upskill employees.The NSC's findings reiterate why I am so proud of the work Comcast has been doing for so long and why we are proud to call NSC a valued partner. Over the last decade, we have grown our Internet Essentials program, the largest and most successful broadband adoption initiative in the industry. Through that program, more than 10 million individuals have become broadband subscribers.And through Project UP, our $1 billion commitment to help advance digital equity, we're partnering with organizations like CodePath, Hispanic Federation, NPower, and Per Scholas to create equitable access to skills and training so more people secure good jobs and climb the economic ladder.One of the featured states in the NSC report is Illinois, which Comcast is proud to serve. 90% of the jobs in that state require digital skills. That's why we're working with local organizations like City Colleges of Chicago to ensure students can build critical digital skills.The pandemic accelerated digital transformation. The importance of not only digital access but also digital skills is clear, and so is the path forward. The NSC's report lays out a roadmap to close the digital skills divide, through increased public investments in digital skill-building.With this knowledge in hand, let's continue to build and nurture partnerships across the public and private sectors to give everyone the opportunity to succeed in today's digital world.Broderick Johnson is Executive Vice President, Public Policy &amp; Executive Vice President, Digital Equity.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/comcast-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/741906/National-Skills-Coalition-Report-We-Must-Close-the-Digital-Skill-Divide]"
223,63d2d67a-4df6-314d-9de5-62aac62167f0,DVN,2023-03-04,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Devon Energy Corporation (DVN) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-devon-energy-140002169.html,1677852002,STORY,['DVN'],"[Devon Energy (DVN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -8.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Devon Energy falls in, has lost 1.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.69 per share, indicating a change of -10.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9.6% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.36 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -11.4%. This estimate has changed -5.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.28 indicates a change of -1.2% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Devon Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $4.29 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.5%. The $17.82 billion and $17.75 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -7% and -0.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $4.3 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.66 for the same period compares with $1.39 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.65 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -7.5%. The EPS surprise was -5.14%.Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have added about 2.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Otis Worldwide due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Otis Q4 Earnings &amp; Sales Beat Estimates, Backlog SolidOtis Worldwide Corporation reported solid results fourth-quarter 2022. Its earnings and sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Its quarterly results reflected strong performance, including mid-single-digit organic sales growth in New Equipment and Service and continued operating profit margin expansion in the Service business.The company remains focused on strong portfolio growth and generating a solid New Equipment backlog. It also intends to expand operating margins, return cash to shareholders through a capital-allocation strategy and pursue additional progress toward ESG goals.Chair, president &amp; CEO of Otis, Judy Marks, stated, “For the third year in a row, we delivered strong annual results. We are successfully navigating through macro challenges that have pressured our business.

The upside was mainly driven by operating profit growth at constant currency and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by headwinds from foreign exchange translation.Net sales of $3.4 billion topped the consensus mark of $3.3 million by 3.8% but declined 3.6% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted net sales fell 1.9% year over year to $3.4 billion. Organically, net sales rose 6.1% year over year for the quarter. Currency headwinds impacted sales by 8.2%.Adjusted operating margin remained flat year over year at 14.7%, as gains from segment performance and the mix were offset by corporate cost headwinds.Story continuesSegment DetailsNew Equipment’s net sales of $1.5 billion fell 6.5% and adjusted net sales of $1.5 billion dropped 3.1% from the prior-year period’s levels. An 8.1% reduction in foreign exchange was partly offset by a 5.1% increase in organic sales.Organic sales were up 12% and 10.7% in the EMEA and the Americas, respectively.

A 6.9% rise in organic sales was offset by an 8.3% headwind from foreign exchange. Organic maintenance and repair sales grew 6.5%, and organic modernization sales rose 8.8% from the prior-year quarter.Adjusted operating margin registered an improvement of 70 bps year over year to 23.9%, driven by higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity, partially offset by wage inflation.2022 HighlightsEarnings were $3.17 per share in the year, reflecting an increase of 7.5% from 2021. Net sales of $13.69 billion declined 4.3% and decreased 3.3% on an adjusted basis. Organic sales witnessed 2.5% growth.New Equipment sales were down 8.8% and down 6.9% on an adjusted basis.

In 2022, FCF was $1.44 billion, down from $1.59 billion in 2021.2023 GuidanceFor 2023, the company expects net sales to be within $13.8-$14.1 billion. The new projection indicates 1.5-4% year-over-year growth. Organic sales growth is projected to be 4-6% (up 3-5% for New Equipment and up 5-7% for Service). Adjusted operating profit is projected to be $2.2-$2.25 billion, up $130 to $175 million at constant currency and up $70 to $130 million at actual currency.Adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to be $3.35-$3.50, suggesting 6-10% year-over-year growth.

He said the application process for the money is designed to prod companies to “express to us their vision for how we drive economic development, how we drive competitiveness, not just at a local level, not just at a state level, but at a regional level.”The funds come from about $53 billion put aside in the CHIPs and Science Act. The administration goal: achieving both a revitalization of the U.S. semiconductor industry— as well as broader political and economic goals that officials say will produce hundred of thousands of jobs in the U.S.One model? “I look to our experience in rebuilding and bringing back from the edge of complete collapse the city of Detroit,” Graves said, referencing his time during the Obama administration as the leader of the federal government’s efforts after the city filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy in 2013. He also mentioned a government-funded network of manufacturing innovation institutes called Manufacturing USA.But the question that remains is whether it’s possible to achieve these goals all at once. Already, some industry voices have reportedly been grumbling about the many restrictions on the money with others pointing out that the most successful projects historically have had limited instead of broader objectives.Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo speaks at the signing event for the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 at the White House on August 9. (REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein)The new law has $39 billion earmarked for semiconductor manufacturers; the application process opened this past week. An additional $11 billion is set to go to companies as well as universities and others for chip research and design beginning later this year. The law also includes an investment tax credit of up to 25% towards a manufacturer’s capital expenditures.‘We're already a hub’Another point made by those who have a stake: these hubs already exist. Thus, they hope the money from Washington will primarily service as an amplifier—not only focus on new development.Story continuesFor example: In a Yahoo Finance Live interview this week, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) noted “we're already a hub for semiconductor manufacturing in the United States, this is just going to expand dramatically because of this legislation.”Intel (INTC) already has a strong presence in Kelly's state with 12,000 employees, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) recently announced plans there as well. For Kelly, a key point of the money is to help develop other companies around Intel and TSMC to help supply the giant fabrication plants to come with equipment, raw materials, and innovation in the years ahead.President Joe Biden walks with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company CEO C. C. Wei and Chairman Mark Liu during a visit to TSMC's planned Semiconductor Fabrication Plant in Arizona in December (REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)It's a similar situation about 2,500 miles away in upstate New York. IBM (IBM) and Micron (MU) are two of the big companies there. There has been years of semiconductor development in the region, which is also seen as a frontrunner for government money.But again, an official there is quick to point out that this area is far from starting from scratch with government money likely to boost what is already there. “Today, I'm talking with you from Albany NanoTech,” said Mukesh Khare, an IBM vice president, in an interview this week. Khare was also recently named to an Industrial Advisory Committee that is advising the Commerce department on the deployment of the law.The Albany Nanotech Complex is a public private partnership that has been growing for decades and was completed in 2015 as a host for a range of companies focused on semiconductor research at the SUNY Polytechnic Institute.Albany’s existing cluster makes good business sense, said Khare, and currently “serves the needs of companies who are here but expanding — with investment from places like CHIPS Act, the state, as well as private companies — will really have a multiplication effect.”The research facilties in New York could be paired with burgeoning manufacturing efforts. IBM recently announced a $20 billion manufacturing plan in nearby Poughkeepsie, N.Y. During an October visit, President Biden took credit for the expansion saying the CHIPs and Science act is “a law that’s going to build the future and a proud, proud legacy not only for IBM, but for the country.”In addition, Micron recently announced plans to invest up to $100 billion over the coming decades in Syracuse N.Y.President Joe Biden participates in a tour of an IBM semiconductor facility with CEO Arvind Krishna in Poughkeepsie, New York in October. (REUTERS/Tom Brenner)But Biden officials have repeatedly promised that no company or region is a shoo-in for the money. “The way that we've structured this and what we've been conveying to potential applicants throughout this process is that their expectation shouldn't be that we're giving a nod to any one area just simply because it already has a fab,” Deputy Secretary Graves said.Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo added “I expect there will be many disappointed companies"" and that her primary lens here ""is the achievement of our national security goals.”Aiming for ‘a win-win situation’The clusters to come will need to strike a balance between the financial imperatives of the semi-conductor sector and the Biden administration's larger policy goals.In addition to economic development, the Commerce Department has stressed that as a condition of applying for the money, companies will have to provide detailed financial information, not engage in stock buybacks with the money they get—and provide detailed workforce development plans down to the level of the childcare facilities they will provide.In a recent Yahoo Finance Live interview, Secretary Raimondo defended the restrictions and said that her goal is not to impose overly burdensome requirements. “We want to work in partnership with these companies.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Advocates of the multi-pronged goals said that the incentives can be aligned so that it’s beneficial to both the private and public sectors. Speaking of the childcare provisions this week, Sen. Kelly argued “This is a win-win situation, it helps families in Arizona and in other states that are going to have these companies there, but at the same time it helps the employer.”As for the timeline ahead, a Commerce official said the first awards will likely be for big fabrication plants - i.e., the anchors of the clusters to come. Deputy Secretary Graves said “we're hopeful that we'll be able to make our first awards by the end of the year, but it's going to depend on whether we get these strong, strategic-thinking applications.”IBM’s Khare added his praise of the government’s rollout so far and notes that, of course, ""we all want it to be much faster than where we are but, that said, it's a process and it needs to be fair and transparent and accountable so we are here to help.”Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

(NYSE:FIS) Just Because It's Going Ex-Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-race-buy-fidelity-national-121731422.html,1677932251,STORY,['FIS'],"[Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Fidelity National Information Services' shares before the 9th of March to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 24th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.52 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.08 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Fidelity National Information Services has a trailing yield of 3.3% on the current stock price of $63.93. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Fidelity National Information Services's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Fidelity National Information Services reported a loss last year, so it's not great to see that it has continued paying a dividend. Given that the company reported a loss last year, we now need to see if it generated enough free cash flow to fund the dividend. If Fidelity National Information Services didn't generate enough cash to pay the dividend, then it must have either paid from cash in the bank or by borrowing money, neither of which is sustainable in the long term. Fortunately, it paid out only 45% of its free cash flow in the past year.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fidelity National Information Services was unprofitable last year and, unfortunately, the general trend suggests its earnings have been in decline over the last five years, making us wonder if the dividend is sustainable at all.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Fidelity National Information Services has delivered 10% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Fidelity National Information Services's financial health, by checking our visualisation of its financial health, here.The Bottom LineHas Fidelity National Information Services got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? We're a bit uncomfortable with it paying a dividend while being loss-making. However, we note that the dividend was covered by cash flow. Overall it doesn't look like the most suitable dividend stock for a long-term buy and hold investor.With that being said, if you're still considering Fidelity National Information Services as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing.

Strong momentum across electric vehicle space on the back of its robust Battery Management System solutions is a positive.Increasing power design wins are other positives.

Considering the abovementioned factors, we expect first-quarter fiscal 2023 total revenue to rise 15.3% year over year.However, weak momentum across major applications and leveraged balance sheet are concerns.

Solid Reinsurance Solutions and Commercial Risk Solutions segments continue to drive the top line.Aon has been divesting non-core operations to streamline its business. It expects that focusing on more profitable operations will generate a higher return on equity. Its pooled employer plan has reached the milestone of $1 billion in U.S. assets and commitments.The company engages in prudent capital deployment. It had around $6.7 billion fund left under its share buyback program as of Sep 30, 2022. However, elevated operating costs can put pressure on margins.

Shares have lost about 1.3% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Brinker International due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Brinker Q2 Earnings and Revenues Surpass EstimatesBrinker reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.Kevin Hochman, chief executive officer and president of Brinker International, stated, ""Our focus on the Team Member and Guest experience, coupled with a more strategic pricing strategy, has allowed us to grow our top line and sequentially improve our margins.

The top line increased 10.1% on a year-over-year basis. The company gained from the solid performance of Maggiano's.Chili'sChili’s revenues in the fiscal second quarter increased 8.7% year over year to $878.7 million. The gain was primarily due to increased menu pricing and the acquisition of 68 restaurants in fiscal 2022, marginally overshadowed by lower traffic.Chili's company restaurant expenses (as a percentage of company sales) in the fiscal second quarter increased to 89.7% year over year from 88.6% reported in the prior-year quarter. The upside can be attributed to a rise in commodity costs, delivery fees, manager salary expenses, hourly wage rates, rent and utilities expenses, marginally offset by sales leverage.Chili's company-owned traffic in the quarter declined 7.6% year over year against the 6.3% growth reported in the prior-year quarter.The segment’s company-owned comps increased 8% in the fiscal second quarter from the year-ago quarter.At Chili’s, domestic comps (including company-owned and franchised) rose 7.5% year over year compared with an 11.5% rise in the prior-year quarter’s levels.Story continuesMaggiano’sMaggiano’s sales rose 19.3% year over year to $140.3 million, primarily due to an increase in the dining room and banquet traffic and a rise in menu pricing. This and growth in off-premise business added to the upside. Comps increased 21.2% year over year. Traffic in the quarter rose 8.4% year over year compared with a gain of 53.3% reported in the prior-year quarter.Maggiano's company restaurant expenses (as a percentage of company sales) in the fiscal second quarter were 80.1% compared with 82.9% reported in the prior-year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to sales leverage. However, this was partially offset by commodity price inflation, higher hourly wage rates, delivery fees, and repair and maintenance costs.Operating ResultsTotal operating costs and expenses in the fiscal second quarter were $978.3 million compared with $886 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The restaurant operating margin, as a percentage of company sales, was 11.6% compared with the 12.1% reported in the prior-year quarter.Balance SheetAs of Dec 28, 2022, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $14.7 million compared with $19.5 million as of Sep 28, 2022.Long-term debt as of Dec 28, 2022, was $1,023.3 million compared with $1,020.8 million as of Sep 28, 2022.

Capital expenditures are expected in the range of $170-$180 million. The company expects fiscal 2023 diluted EPS in the range of $2.60-$2.90.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresCurrently, Brinker International has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

(UPS) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-united-parcel-140002512.html,1677852002,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service (UPS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this package delivery service have returned -3.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.5% change. The Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, to which UPS belongs, has lost 3.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.UPS is expected to post earnings of $2.28 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -25.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -11.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.58 points to a change of -10.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.71 indicates a change of +1.1% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UPS is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UPS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of UPS, the consensus sales estimate of $22.98 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -5.7%. The $97.99 billion and $101.13 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -2.3% and +3.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $27.03 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.7%. EPS of $3.62 for the same period compares with $3.59 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.95 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.27%. The EPS surprise was +1.12%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders.”Berkshire Hathaway bought Coca-Cola (KO) in 1994 and American Express (AXP) in 1995. It still owns big positions in both stocks. The annual letter says that Coke paid Berkshire $75 million in dividends in 1994 and by 2022 it was paying $704 million. That’s the power of patience, discipline and compounding over the course of 28 years.What can the rest of us learn from great investor’s long-term stock trades?5 Stocks for Long-Term Investors1.       Merck &amp; Co., Inc. MRKIn 1950, Anne Scheiber, considered one of the most successful retail investors ever, bought 1,000 shares of Schering-Plough for $10,000. She held it for 45 years until her death in 1995. After 45 years, the shares were worth $7.2 million, with dividends reinvested. Schering-Plough was bought by Merck in 2009.Merck still pays a dividend. It is currently yielding 2.75%.Should Merck be on your short list?2.       Coca-Cola Inc. KOCoca-Cola has paid a dividend for 60 consecutive years. Not only that, it has actually raised it every year during that time. It’s a true dividend aristocrat.But shares of Coca-Cola have lagged the S&amp;P 500 since Buffett bought it. It’s up just over 400% since Aug 31, 1994 while the S&amp;P 500 was up 734% during that same time.Story continuesShould you sacrifice performance for Coca-Cola’s dividend?3.       Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. COKEWhat if Buffett had bought the Coca-Cola bottler, instead of the beverage company, in 1994? Coca-Cola Consolidated pays a dividend too, but it’s only yielding 0.4% in 2023.But shares of Coca-Cola Consolidated have outperformed in that time. $10,000 invested in Coca-Cola Consolidated would have been $304,464 by Mar 1, 2023. Shares were up 2,952% during that time.Should you look beyond the well-known big cap names with a company like Coca-Cola Consolidated?4.       American Express AXPAmerican Express has been a staple in Buffett’s portfolio since 1995. It paid Berkshire $41 million in dividends that first year but in 2022 it paid $302 million.American Express is currently yielding 1.2%.Shares of American Express have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 since 1995. Shares are up 1,359% since Dec 29, 1995 compared to the S&amp;P 500 which was up 556% in that same period.Should American Express be on your short list?5.       Chevron Corp. CVXChevron has only recently been added to the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio so it doesn’t have a 28-year track record in the portfolio like Coke does. But it does also have an outstanding dividend paying track record. Coincidence? Chevron has raised it’s dividend 36 consecutive years.In Jan 2023, Chevron raised its quarterly dividend again, raising it 6%, or $0.09, to $1.51. It currently yields 3.8%.Should long-term investors consider buying Chevron?What Else Do You Need to Know About How to Be a Great Long-Term Investor?  Listen to this week’s podcast to find out. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Earnings and net sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were hurt by the continued impact of inflationary pressures, supply chain inefficiencies and drab sales volumes in the company’s business segments. Incidentally, management lowered its earnings per share (EPS) guidance range for fiscal 2023.Quarter in DetailHormel Foods’ earnings of 40 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents per share. The metric declined from 44 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Net sales in the quarter were $2,971 million compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,097.6 million. The top line decreased 2.4% from $3,044.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Gross profit declined to $495.9 million from $538.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Gross profit margin contracted 100 basis points due to an unfavorable mix and continued inflationary pressures. These were somewhat offset by the impact of pricing actions.Selling, general and administrative expenses came in at $222.1 million compared with almost $226 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Hormel Foods Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hormel Foods Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseHormel Foods Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Hormel Foods Corporation Quote Segment DetailsBeginning Oct 31, 2022, Hormel Foods transitioned to three operating segments namely Retail, Foodservice and International.Net sales in the Retail unit decreased 1.9% year over year to $1,957.8. The downside can be attributed to reduced sales for value-added meats, and snacking and entertaining verticals. These were somewhat offset by rise in net sales growth from global flavors, bacon, convenient meals and proteins as well as emerging brands verticals. Volume in the segment fell 13%. Segmental profit went down 9% in the quarter.Net sales in the Foodservice segment fell 2.3% to $834.8 million, while volumes fell 6%. The decline in the net sales can be somewhat attributed to reduced net pricing reflecting commodity relief for some categories. Segmental profit went up 1% in the quarter.Net sales in the International unit fell 8.1% year over year to $178.4 million on reduced sales in China owing to the ongoing COVID-related disruption. That said, branded exports, including SPAM and SKIPPY brands and better results in Brazil, were a breather. Volume in the segment went down 27%.

In the quarter that ended Jan 29, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $203.6 million and capital expenditures totaled $37 million. Management expects to incur capital expenditures of $350 million in fiscal 2023.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGuidanceHormel Foods remains well-placed in the retail, foodservice and international channels and expects to fuel top-line growth. Management expects to see favorable demand for its leading retail brands and Foodservice business. Increased brand investments, innovation and HRL’s initial GoFWD actions are likely to support growth. However, the company’s earnings have been pressured by higher inefficiencies in the supply chain due to increased inventory levels and softness in the snack nuts unit.HRL projects fiscal 2023 net sales in the range of $12.6-$12.9 billion, indicating 1-3% growth from the fiscal 2022 level.

251,3b656252-cf9b-3713-aa3e-6638b1e93a0f,OXY,2023-03-04,Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-corporation-oxy-attracting-140002116.html,1677852002,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (OXY) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned -3.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, which Occidental falls in, has lost 2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Occidental is expected to post earnings of $1.52 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.48 points to a change of -30.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.78 indicates a change of -10.9% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.8%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Occidental.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Occidental, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.09 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -5.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $32.84 billion and $31.18 billion estimates indicate -11.5% and -5.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $8.33 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4%. EPS of $1.61 for the same period compares with $1.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.67 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.95%. The EPS surprise was -12.02%.Over the last four quarters, Occidental surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have lost about 1.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Boston Scientific due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Boston Scientific Q4 Earnings Lag Estimates, Operating Margin GrowsBoston Scientific posted adjusted earnings per share of 45 cents for the fourth quarter of 2022, in line with the year-ago figure. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.3%.

This adjusted figure matched the lower end of the company’s guidance of $1.71 to $1.74. However, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.2%.Fourth-quarter revenues of $3.24 billion improved 3.7% year over year on a reported basis and 8.7% on an operational basis (at a constant exchange rate or CER). Revenues grew 7.1% on an organic basis (adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations and certain recent acquisitions and divestments). The top line came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The quarter’s top-line performance also remained within the company’s projection of organic revenue growth of approximately 7-9%.For 2022, revenues were $12.68 billion, up 6.7% on a reported basis, 11.1% on an operational basis and 8.7% on an organic basis, all compared to the year-ago period. Full-year revenues were also in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s guidance was 9% organic revenue growth for the full year.Story continuesQ4 Revenues in DetailIn the fourth quarter, revenues rose 10.5% in the United States on a reported basis (same operationally). Revenues were down 0.8% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region (up 10.8%) and 4.1% in the Asia Pacific zone (up 15.3%). Revenues increased 14.6% in Latin America and Canada (up 17.7%) and 11.6% in emerging markets (up 23.3%).Segmental AnalysisBoston Scientific recently reorganized its operational structure and aggregated its core businesses, each of which generates revenues from the sale of Medical Devices, into two reportable segments, MedSurg and Cardiovascular.The company generates maximum revenues from Cardiovascular. Sales from its sub-segments, Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions, were $1.53 billion (up 9.6% year over year organically) and $476 million (up 8.8%), respectively, in the fourth quarter.Within MedSurg, Endoscopy generated revenues of $571 million, up 7.4% organically. Urology and Urology revenues were $477 million, reflecting organic growth of 11.8%. Neuromodulation within MedSurg reported $249 million in revenues, reflecting a 4.9% rise organically year over year.MarginsGross margin in the fourth quarter contracted 13 basis points (bps) year over year to 68.8%. There was a 4.1% rise in the cost of products sold to $1.01 billion.Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 0.9% to $1.16 billion. Research and development expenses rose 3.1% to $330 million. Royalty expenses of $13 million increased 18.2% year over year. Adjusted operating margin expanded 87 bps to 22.4% in the reported quarter.2023 GuidanceBoston Scientific provided its full-year and first-quarter 2023 guidance.Full-year net sales growth is expected in the range of 5-7% on a reported basis. Net sales growth is expected to be in the range of 6-8% on an organic basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $12.68 billion, indicating a 6.7% rise from the 2022 reported figure. Full-year adjusted earnings per share is expected in the range of $1.86 to $1.93. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.73 remains below the guided range.For the first quarter of 2023, revenue growth is projected in the range of approximately 3-5% on a reported basis (an increase of 6-8% organically). Adjusted earnings are expected in the range of 42-44 cents per share. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings and revenues is pegged at 44 cents and $3.17 billion, respectively.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresAt this time, Boston Scientific has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions has been net zero. Notably, Boston Scientific has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders.”Berkshire Hathaway bought Coca-Cola (KO) in 1994 and American Express (AXP) in 1995. It still owns big positions in both stocks. The annual letter says that Coke paid Berkshire $75 million in dividends in 1994 and by 2022 it was paying $704 million. That’s the power of patience, discipline and compounding over the course of 28 years.What can the rest of us learn from great investor’s long-term stock trades?5 Stocks for Long-Term Investors1.       Merck &amp; Co., Inc. MRKIn 1950, Anne Scheiber, considered one of the most successful retail investors ever, bought 1,000 shares of Schering-Plough for $10,000. She held it for 45 years until her death in 1995. After 45 years, the shares were worth $7.2 million, with dividends reinvested. Schering-Plough was bought by Merck in 2009.Merck still pays a dividend. It is currently yielding 2.75%.Should Merck be on your short list?2.       Coca-Cola Inc. KOCoca-Cola has paid a dividend for 60 consecutive years. Not only that, it has actually raised it every year during that time. It’s a true dividend aristocrat.But shares of Coca-Cola have lagged the S&amp;P 500 since Buffett bought it. It’s up just over 400% since Aug 31, 1994 while the S&amp;P 500 was up 734% during that same time.Story continuesShould you sacrifice performance for Coca-Cola’s dividend?3.       Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. COKEWhat if Buffett had bought the Coca-Cola bottler, instead of the beverage company, in 1994? Coca-Cola Consolidated pays a dividend too, but it’s only yielding 0.4% in 2023.But shares of Coca-Cola Consolidated have outperformed in that time. $10,000 invested in Coca-Cola Consolidated would have been $304,464 by Mar 1, 2023. Shares were up 2,952% during that time.Should you look beyond the well-known big cap names with a company like Coca-Cola Consolidated?4.       American Express AXPAmerican Express has been a staple in Buffett’s portfolio since 1995. It paid Berkshire $41 million in dividends that first year but in 2022 it paid $302 million.American Express is currently yielding 1.2%.Shares of American Express have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 since 1995. Shares are up 1,359% since Dec 29, 1995 compared to the S&amp;P 500 which was up 556% in that same period.Should American Express be on your short list?5.       Chevron Corp. CVXChevron has only recently been added to the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio so it doesn’t have a 28-year track record in the portfolio like Coke does. But it does also have an outstanding dividend paying track record. Coincidence? Chevron has raised it’s dividend 36 consecutive years.In Jan 2023, Chevron raised its quarterly dividend again, raising it 6%, or $0.09, to $1.51. It currently yields 3.8%.Should long-term investors consider buying Chevron?What Else Do You Need to Know About How to Be a Great Long-Term Investor?  Listen to this week’s podcast to find out. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Has Coca-Cola European (CCEP) been one of those stocks this year? Let's take a closer look at the stock's year-to-date performance to find out.Coca-Cola European is one of 198 individual stocks in the Consumer Staples sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #3 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.The Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks. This system has a long record of success, and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months. Coca-Cola European is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CCEP's full-year earnings has moved 3.2% higher. This signals that analyst sentiment is improving and the stock's earnings outlook is more positive.Based on the most recent data, CCEP has returned 0.6% so far this year. Meanwhile, stocks in the Consumer Staples group have lost about 2.1% on average. As we can see, Coca-Cola European is performing better than its sector in the calendar year.One other Consumer Staples stock that has outperformed the sector so far this year is Chewy (CHWY). The stock is up 7.9% year-to-date.The consensus estimate for Chewy's current year EPS has increased 270% over the past three months.

272,b56f89e9-909a-311d-ab3b-1e259390d428,KO,2023-03-04,Investors Heavily Search CocaCola Company (The) (KO): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-cocacola-company-140002843.html,1677852002,STORY,"['KO', '^GSPC']","[Coca-Cola (KO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned -0.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.5% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coke belongs, has gained 0.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.60 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4.8%. This estimate has changed +1.9% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.79 indicates a change of +7.2% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Coke.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Coke, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.8 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $44.67 billion and $46.97 billion estimates indicate +3.9% and +5.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $10.13 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7%. EPS of $0.45 for the same period compares with $0.45 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.2%. The EPS surprise was 0%.Over the last four quarters, Coke surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:MHK)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportunity-mohawk-industries-inc-122805471.html,1677932885,STORY,['MHK'],"[Mohawk Industries, Inc. (NYSE:MHK), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Mohawk Industries’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Mohawk Industries What's The Opportunity In Mohawk Industries?Great news for investors – Mohawk Industries is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $144.03, but it is currently trading at US$106 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Mohawk Industries’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Mohawk Industries?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Mohawk Industries. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder?

Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients who have a targeted reduction in Total Symptom Score (TSS), change in TSS, time to the first ≥50% reduction in TSS, overall survival, number of treatment emergent adverse events, time of onset of targeted reduction in spleen volume and duration of maintenance of targeted reduction in spleen volume.About LIMBERIncyte is a leader in the discovery and development of therapies for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

(NYSE:WM) Pays A US$0.70 Dividend In Just Four Days",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waste-management-inc-nyse-wm-122609312.html,1677932769,STORY,['WM'],"[Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Waste Management's shares before the 9th of March in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 24th of March.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.70 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.80 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Waste Management has a trailing yield of 1.9% on the current share price of $150.08. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Waste Management's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Waste Management has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Waste Management Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Waste Management paying out a modest 48% of its earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out more than half (55%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see Waste Management earnings per share are up 4.3% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share growth has been slim, and the company is already paying out a majority of its earnings. While there is some room to both increase the payout ratio and reinvest in the business, generally the higher a payout ratio goes, the lower a company's prospects for future growth.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Waste Management has lifted its dividend by approximately 7.0% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpHas Waste Management got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share growth has been modest, and it's interesting that Waste Management is paying out less than half of its earnings and more than half its cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends. Overall, it's hard to get excited about Waste Management from a dividend perspective.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Waste Management is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Waste Management you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Healthcare Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.According to a report by T.Rowe Price, healthcare stocks can be generally divided into two categories. The first is high-growth stocks from the life sciences and biotechnology segments. These companies are promising breakthrough therapies, have high valuations and aggressive growth models. However, investing in these stocks is not without risk and volatility. The second category comprises major pharmaceutical companies that are mature and considered as defensive plays. Earnings growth expectations for these companies are more “modest but also expected to be more consistent from quarter to quarter,” the report added. The report also gave some practical advice to investors when it comes to healthcare stocks:“If you are a disciplined long-term investor, health care stocks may be a good addition to the aggressive part of your equity portfolio. For example, of the equity portion of a well- diversified portfolio, 20% might be in health care.”The Bull Case for the US Healthcare IndustryA team of Morgan Stanley analysts highlighted the bull case for the US healthcare sector in a 2019 report. The report said that the US healthcare sector has outperformed broader markets over the past 45 years. Most importantly, the report said that the sector has outperformed during five of the last six recessions, that too by 9% on average. This makes the healthcare sector worthy of investors’ attention as we are in the middle of a recession scenario that is becoming likely by the day amid persistent inflation and the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes.The Morgan Stanley report highlighted that unlike other sectors, the healthcare sector’s underperformance tends to be short-lived.The report also said that the healthcare sector in the US is undervalued relative to other defensive sectors. The sector, according to the report,  trades at a 17% discount to the average of staples and utilities forward P/E ratios.Story continuesMost Undervalued Healthcare Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsOur MethodologyFor this article, we scoured the Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds’ holdings and picked top 13 healthcare stocks with PE ratios (trailing or forward) under 15 as of February 22 with highest number of hedge fund investors. The idea was the pick the most favorite undervalued healthcare stocks of elite hedge funds. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors.Most Undervalued Healthcare Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds13. Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22California-based Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI) ranks 13th in our list of the most undervalued healthcare stocks to buy according to hedge funds.Insider Monkey’s database of elite hedge funds shows that 22 funds reported owning stakes in Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI) at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The biggest stakeholder of Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI) out of these funds was Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP which had a $39 million stake in the firm.In Q4, Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVI)’s EPS came in at $0.35, surpassing estimates by $0.01. Revenue however fell 10.4% on a YoY basis to $204.7 million, missing estimates by $0.25 million.12. QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33California-based QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) makes diagnostics products. Recently, QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) posted strong Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.76, beating estimates by $0.34. Revenue in the period jumped about 36% on a YoY basis to reach $866.5 million, beating estimates by $90.69 million.QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) said that for 2023 it expects adjusted EPS in the range of $5.00-$5.60. The consensus estimate for this figure was $5.19. Revenue was expected to come in the range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion, versus the consensus estimate of $2.81 billion. QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) said that it expects to deliver high-single-digit top-line growth over the long term.A total of 33 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The total value of these stakes was $720 million. The biggest stakeholder of QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) during this period wasMeridian Funds made the following comment about QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL) is a global leader in the diagnostics industry. The merger of Quidel and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics has resulted in a top 10 player in the in-vitro diagnostics industry, combining Quidel’s strong point of care platform with Ortho’s blood chemistry and transfusion platform. We believe the new company will be much more consistent in its ability to deliver steady top-line growth at attractive margins to fuel free cash flow growth. Further boosting our conviction in QuidelOrtho is its robust product pipeline. Pipeline developments include the company’s Savanna platform, which solves a long-term need for near-patient molecular testing that is accurate, fast, and economical. We believe the stock weakness is due to the anticipated decline in COVID-19 testing. However, we believe the long-term earnings and free cash flow profile are underappreciated, and as a result we increased our position in the stock.”11. BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) saw a jump in hedge fund sentiment during the fourth quarter, as Insider Monkey’s propritery database of 943 hedge fund holdings shows that 34 hedge funds ended the fourth quarter with BNTX in their portfolios, compared with 18 hedge funds in the previous quarter. The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) at the end of 2022 was Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management which had a stake worth over $93 million in the company.BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and Pfizer recently announced that they have submitted applications seeking FDA approval to use Omicron-adjusted vaccine as a primary series or a booster dose in people aged 12 years and above.Artisan Partners made the following comment about BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) is a leading biotech company focused on developing immunotherapies to treat cancer and other serious diseases. Over the past year, we trimmed our position significantly as we believed the stock’s valuation failed to reflect the windfall nature of COVID-19 vaccine cash flows. With the stock nearly 70% off its highs and, more importantly, at a reasonable discount to our PMV estimate, we view the valuation as opportunistic given its long-term profit cycle potential. BioNTech’s intellectual property in mRNA, and COVID funded manufacturing capacity leave it well-positioned to develop new mRNA vaccines and cancer therapies. In addition, the company has non-mRNA technology (e.g., cell therapy assets) and blue-chip partnerships offering additional optionality. While the company’s R&amp;D pipeline beyond COVID-19 vaccines will take some time to mature, it is well funded by close to $20 billion in COVID-vaccine proceeds. We increased our position within the GardenSM as the stock declined.”10. DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) is known for its kidney dialysis services. Insider Monkey database of 943 hedge fund holdings shows that 34 funds had invested in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, up from 30 hedge funds in the previous quarter. The total value of these stakes at the end of December 2022 was close to $3 billion. The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) was Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.The Colorado-based company recently posted its fourth-quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $0.59, while revenue totaled $2.92 billion. Operating income in the quarter came in at $256 million. Adjusted operating income in the quarter was $317 million.Some other notable stocks hedge funds are piling into from the healthcare sector include Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA). Moon Capital made the following comment about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)9.

(NYSE:AMN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“New positions initiated in Q3 included Ciena Corporation (long), AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (NYSE:AMN) (short), CBIZ Inc (short), Asana (short) and Palomar (short). AMN Healthcare Services provides workforce solutions and staffing services at healthcare facilities. An unstable healthcare employment environment is driving pricing and volume growth for contract labor, which we believe is unsustainable.”8. Organon &amp; Co.

Organon reported 2Q22 revenue of $1.59 billion, -0.6% Y/Y, ahead of consensus of $1.54 billion, and Adjusted EPS of $1.25, -27.3% Y/Y, in-line with analyst expectations. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter came in at $512 million (32.3% margin), compared to 2Q21 Adjusted EBITDA of $627 million (39.3% margin). Management revised FY22 guidance for revenue of $6.1-6.3 billion, compared to previous guidance for revenue of $6.1-6.4 billion, to reflect persisting foreign exchange (FX) headwinds, and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 32-34%, compared to prior guidance for a margin of 34-36%, which incorporates ~$110 million of in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) and milestone expenses from business development.

Investors are concerned about legal liabilities associated with its antacid drug Zantac. While it is impossible to know the outcome with certainty, our preliminary assessment suggests that the decline in market capitalization exceeds the likely financial impact on the company.”6.

New product launches and channel expansion initiatives are also aiding the segment.Graco’s policy of investing in product innovation and capacity expansion should fuel its growth. In 2023, the company anticipates capital expenditures of approximately $200 million, with $130 million for facility expansion projects at its Minnesota, South Dakota, Switzerland and Romania facilities. In 2022, GGG invented products like ES 500 Stencil rig, LineLazer ES 500 electric battery-powered airless striper, et al.GGG’s measures to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are noteworthy. It paid out dividends of $142.1 million in 2022 and repurchased shares worth $233.4 million in the same period. Also, the quarterly dividend rate was hiked by 11.9% in December 2022.In light of the abovementioned positives, we believe, investors should hold on to Graco stock for now, as suggested by its current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This consists of nearly $114 million SDG&amp;E applied for and secured on behalf of its customers via the California Arrearage Payment Program to offset customers' outstanding bills incurred between March 4, 2020 and Dec. 31, 2021; more than $10 million processed through the federally funded Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to offset overdue bills; and more than $15 million forgiven under the Arrearage Management Payment Plan.Additionally, SDG&amp;E has run multiple marketing campaigns and collaborated with many nonprofit, community-based organizations to publicize a variety of assistance programs. About a third of SDG&amp;E customers are enrolled in assistance programs ranging from bill discounts to debt forgiveness to payment arrangements.""Inflation, the lingering effects of the pandemic, and the recent unprecedented conditions in the natural gas market have caused financial strain for our customers,"" said SDG&amp;E Vice President of Customer Services Dana Golan. ""Our priority is to help them get the financial relief they need through a variety of assistance programs.""Numbers at a Glance ~ 354,000 SDG&amp;E customers are currently enrolled in the CARE program, which offers 30% or more in bill discounts for income-qualified customers.More than 12,000 customers, who don't qualify for the CARE discount, are enrolled in the FERA program, which offers an 18% discount on electric bills.Nearly 11,600 customers are enrolled in the Arrearage Management Payment Plan, a 12-month payment plan that forgives up to $8,000 in utility debt.Nearly 50,000 customers are currently enrolled in payment installment plans.Nearly 70,000 customers are enrolled in the Medical Baseline Program, which provides a higher allowance of electricity at a lower cost for eligible customers who depend on certain medical devices for their health.Story continuesMore information about assistance programs can be found at sdge.com/assistance.SDG&amp;E Shareholder-Funded Assistance ProgramsRecently, SDG&amp;E also announced $16 million in relief for customers and in community assistance funds. As part this commitment, SDG&amp;E will fund a new $10 million program to support local nonprofit, community-based organizations that provide essential services to vulnerable residents. The company is also immediately increasing funding for its Neighbor-to-Neighbor bill assistance program to $6 million while doubling the amount of financial support available to each qualifying household (from $300 to $600 per year) and expanding eligibility to ensure more customers can take advantage of the program.CA Climate Credit Offsetting February and March BillsSDG&amp;E customers are also seeing some bill relief in February and March, thanks the California Climate Credit. SDG&amp;E worked with regulators to move up the timing of the natural gas and electric climate credit to help offset winter bills. In February, natural gas customers received a $43.40 credit, and this month, electric customers will see a $60.70 credit. The California Public Utilities Commission moved up the timing of the climate credit to provide winter bill relief.SDG&amp;E is an innovative San Diego-based energy company that provides clean, safe and reliable energy to better the lives of the people it serves in San Diego and southern Orange counties. The company is committed to creating a sustainable future by providing its electricity from renewable sources; modernizing natural gas pipelines; accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles; supporting numerous non-profit partners; and, investing in innovative technologies to ensure the reliable operation of the region's infrastructure for generations to come.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance the Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) share price is 124% higher than it was three years ago. That sort of return is as solid as granite. On top of that, the share price is up 11% in about a quarter. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.Since it's been a strong week for Valero Energy shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Valero Energy achieved compound earnings per share growth of 74% per year. The average annual share price increase of 31% is actually lower than the EPS growth. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 4.56.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Valero Energy has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on Valero Energy's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Valero Energy the TSR over the last 3 years was 160%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Valero Energy shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 69% over one year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 13%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Shares have lost about 1.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Murphy USA due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Murphy USA’s Q4 Earnings Miss EstimateMurphy USA announced fourth-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $5.21, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.16. The underperformance could be attributed to lower-than-expected petroleum product sales.However, MUSA’s bottom line was significantly above the year-earlier quarter’s adjusted profit of $4.23 per share, backed by a rise in the retail gasoline price and a higher retail margin of 30.6 cents per gallon, up 11.3% year over year.Meanwhile, Murphy USA’s operating revenues of $5.4 billion rose 12.6% year over year and brushed past the consensus mark by $47 million, primarily due to improved merchandise sales.Merchandise sales, at $989.4 million, rose 6.7% year over year and outperformed the consensus mark of $970 million. However, revenues from petroleum product sales came in at $4.3 billion, falling 1.8% short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but up 13.6% from the fourth quarter of 2021.Key TakeawaysMUSA’s total fuel contribution rose 20.1% year over year to $369.3 million due to margin expansion and higher volumes. Total fuel contribution (including retail fuel margin plus product supply and wholesale results) came in at 30.6 cents per gallon, which improved more than 11% from the fourth quarter of 2021.Retail fuel contribution increased 19.6% year over year to $341.2 million as margins widened to 28.3 cents per gallon from 25.5 cents in the corresponding period of 2021. Retail gallons rose 7.8% from the year-ago period to 1,206.3 million in the quarter under review and edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4%. Volumes on an SSS basis (or fuel gallons per store) improved 5.2% from the fourth quarter of 2021 to 241.6 thousand. Meanwhile, the average retail gasoline price during the quarter came in at $3.19 per gallon, up from $3.05 per gallon a year ago.Contribution from Merchandise increased 4.2% to $189 million on higher sales, which more than offset the fall in unit margins, from 19.6% a year ago to 19.15% in the fourth quarter of 2022. On an SSS basis, total merchandise contribution was up 3.1% year over year, primarily on the back of 5.5% higher tobacco margins. Meanwhile, merchandise sales increased 4.4% on an SSS basis due to an increase in tobacco as well as non-tobacco sales.The company’s monthly fuel gallons were up 5.4% from the prior-year period, while merchandise sales increased 4.7% on an average per store month basis.Story continuesBalance SheetAs of Dec 31, Murphy USA — which opened 13 new retail locations in the quarter to take its store count to 1,712 — had cash and cash equivalents of $60.5 million and long-term debt (including lease obligations) of $1.8 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 73.7%.During the quarter, MUSA bought back shares worth $239.5 million.GuidanceThe company projects 2023 fuel volume in a range of 240 to 245 thousand gallons on an APSM basis. Further, Murphy USA’s 2023 guidance includes up to 45 new stores and up to 30 raze-and-rebuilds, $795-$815 million in merchandise margin contribution, and $375-$425 million in capital expenditures.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresAt this time, Murphy USA has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Murphy USA has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerMurphy USA is part of the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry. Over the past month, Valero Energy (VLO), a stock from the same industry, has gained 4.6%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended December 2022 more than a month ago.Valero Energy reported revenues of $41.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.3%. EPS of $8.45 for the same period compares with $2.47 a year ago.For the current quarter, Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $6.90 per share, indicating a change of +198.7% from the year-ago quarter.

AN, CNH Industrial N.V. CNHI, Valero Energy Corp. VLO, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Ryder System, Inc. R.Top 5 Stocks with High ROE as Equity Markets Flop in FebruaryThe U.S. equity markets' downtrend continued in the past few trading sessions as strong economic data and a tight labor market portrayed signs that inflation was still a force to reckon with. Despite a solid start to the year, the equity markets largely remained choppy in February, while the 10-year Treasury yields jumped sharply to hit the highest level since November 2022. Experts widely believe that these will likely force the Fed to continue its aggressive stance against inflationary pressures.Fed had earlier raised the interest rates by 25 basis points – much akin to the broader expectations – and kept the door ajar for future hikes as it indicated that the battle against inflation was far from over. It also expected economic growth to remain subdued in 2023. Average hourly earnings in January fell 0.2% on a sequential basis and were down 1.8% from a year ago. The uncertain business environment failed to paint a clearer picture of the overall economy and led to the cacophony that drove the broader equity market volatility.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. AutoNation, Inc., CNH Industrial N.V., Valero Energy Corp., Hologic, Inc. and Ryder System, Inc. are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityStory continuesROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Here are five of the 22 stocks that qualified the screen:AutoNation: Incorporated in Delaware in 1991, AutoNation is the largest automotive retailer in the United States.

289,5e724531-1ed4-3727-8a9d-d63374185f86,UNH,2023-03-04,Humana (HUM) Ties Up To Offer Value-Based Care to MA Members,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/humana-hum-ties-offer-value-170005998.html,1677862805,STORY,['UNH'],"[Humana Inc. HUM recently teamed up with the largest independent primary care network in the United States – Aledade. By virtue of the decade-long tie-up, the Medicare Advantage members of Humana under value-based care agreements will be entitled to receive uninterrupted primary care from in-network Aledade-enabled physicians. The latest partnership is expected to strengthen the existing ties between Humana and Aledade, who have been working in unison since 2019 to bring about better patient health outcomes. The success of their collaboration can be substantiated across those limited markets in which they have jointly catered to and brought about higher primary care visits, lower inpatient hospitalizations and reduced readmissions. The recent announcement of collaborating with one of the largest value-based care providers of Humana (Aledade) reflects HUM’s intensified focus to bring more patients under the ambit of value-based care agreements. Enrollment in such deals fetches multiple benefits for patients, some of which are increased preventive screenings that result in the early diagnosis and treatment of a disease, improved patient engagement and a decline in emergency room visits.Value-based care agreements also assure to bring down the healthcare expenses of patients. And Aledade seems to be the apt partner to complement Humana’s endeavor of minimizing the out-of-pocket expenses of its members. Aledade is backed by a solid history of enabling primary care clinicians to render quality care to patients and managing to generate healthcare cost savings of over $1.2 billion in the past eight years.Encouraged by such tailwinds, more individuals are likely to be motivated to opt for physician care under value-based care agreements. Consequently, the count of patients in Humana’s network that receive care under a value-based agreement with an Aledade-enabled physician practice, which stood at 100,000-plus at 2022-end, is expected to receive a boost with the latest move. Story continuesA growing customer base might fortify premiums and the nationwide presence of Humana. The healthcare provider seems prudent to bolster its Medicare Advantage business through the tie-up. Among approximately 8.6 million members served through its Medicare business, Medicare Advantage members of around 5.6 million form a significant portion. Also, the thought of effectively catering to the Medicare Advantage plan is time opportune, considering the growing aging population in the United States.HUM’s management anticipates individual Medicare Advantage membership to witness minimum membership growth of 625,000 in 2023, up from the earlier projection of an increase in the range of 325,000-400,000.To grow its Medicare business, Humana pursues alliances with physicians and well-established healthcare organizations. HUM has also taken the help of such initiatives to devise Medicare Advantage plans, similar to the one named Humana USAA Honor with Rx that Humana developed by teaming up with USAA Life for the benefit of the U.S. veteran community. Other factors such as contract wins and renewals have also provided an impetus to Humana’s Medicare business.Shares of Humana have gained 12.3% in a year against the industry’s 3.9% decline.

The acquisitions were effective from Mar 1, 2023, and are subject to long-term, triple net leases.These buyouts reflect ENSG’s efforts to bring better health outcomes in its operational markets and consolidate its presence in Colorado.Such growth endeavors should provide an impetus to revenues of the ENSG’s Skilled Services segment, through which it provides skilled nursing and senior living services, physical, occupational and speech therapies as well as other rehabilitative and healthcare services. This segment generated $2.9 billion in revenue for 2022, an increase of 15.2% from the prior year.The Ensign Group invests in and provides skilled nursing and senior living services, amongst many other services. Post this acquisition, the company’s portfolio would have 290 healthcare operations, 26 of which are senior living operations in 13 states.Ensign Group follows an aggressive inorganic growth strategy and multiple buyouts which were pursued almost every month of this year bears testament to this fact. Apart from expanding its healthcare portfolio and strengthening its U.S. foothold, each facility buyout upgrades ENSG’s capabilities and enables it to extend its high-quality healthcare services.With no mood to slow its expansion growth, management keeps an eye on detecting opportunistic real-estate buyouts. It also aims to lease robust and struggling skilled nursing, assisted living and other healthcare-linked businesses across the United States.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI), The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL) and Aon plc (AON). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Analog Devices have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry over the past year (+17.6% vs. +13.8%). The company is riding on the strength across consumer, communications, industrial and automotive markets. Solid demand for high-performance analog as well as mixed signal solutions is a tailwind. Strong momentum across electric vehicle space on the back of its robust Battery Management System solutions is a positive.Increasing power design wins are other positives. Solid momentum of HEV platform across cabin electronics ecosystem is a tailwind. The company also remains optimistic about the growth prospects related to 5G. Considering the abovementioned factors, we expect first-quarter fiscal 2023 total revenue to rise 15.3% year over year.However, weak momentum across major applications and leveraged balance sheet are concerns. Pandemic induced supply-chain constraints and geopolitical tensions led by Russia-Ukraine war remain major overhangs.(You can read the full research report on Analog Devices here &gt;&gt;&gt;)The Estée Lauder shares have modestly outperformed the Zacks Cosmetics industry over the past six months (+0.2% vs. -1.6%) on the back of momentum in the company's online business. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, its freestanding store in the U.S. saw impressive performance fueled by enhanced omnichannel capabilities and more demand for high-touch services.The Estée Lauder’s strong presence in emerging markets has been a driver. Management is on track to expand its consumer reach in productive distribution across high-growth channels while strategically expanding brands into new countries.However, the company expects the rest of fiscal 2023 to remain pressurized by temporary hurdles stemming from pandemic-led curbs in China, foreign currency headwinds, heightened inflation, supply-chain bottlenecks and the risk of sluggishness in certain markets globally.(You can read the full research report on The Estee Lauder here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Aon have gained +2.7% over the past year against the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry’s gain of +2.9%. The company’s top line has been growing on buyouts and alliances, which have enhanced its capabilities and made it one of the largest insurance brokers. Solid Reinsurance Solutions and Commercial Risk Solutions segments continue to drive the top line.Aon has been divesting non-core operations to streamline its business. It expects that focusing on more profitable operations will generate a higher return on equity. Its pooled employer plan has reached the milestone of $1 billion in U.S. assets and commitments.The company engages in prudent capital deployment. It had around $6.7 billion fund left under its share buyback program as of Sep 30, 2022. However, elevated operating costs can put pressure on margins.

293,f60a165b-7018-3fb7-acdd-5ce3a92c1bf1,ADP,2023-03-04,"Income Investors Should Know That Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/income-investors-know-automatic-data-120312272.html,1677931392,STORY,['ADP'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Automatic Data Processing's shares on or after the 9th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of April.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.25 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$5.00 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Automatic Data Processing has a trailing yield of approximately 2.2% on its current stock price of $224.75. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Automatic Data Processing is paying out an acceptable 58% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out more than half (59%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Fortunately for readers, Automatic Data Processing's earnings per share have been growing at 14% a year for the past five years. Automatic Data Processing is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. Given the quick rate of earnings per share growth and current level of payout, there may be a chance of further dividend increases in the future.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Automatic Data Processing has delivered an average of 12% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Automatic Data Processing for the upcoming dividend? Higher earnings per share generally lead to higher dividends from dividend-paying stocks over the long run. However, we'd also note that Automatic Data Processing is paying out more than half of its earnings and cash flow as profits, which could limit the dividend growth if earnings growth slows. All things considered, we are not particularly enthused about Automatic Data Processing from a dividend perspective.So while Automatic Data Processing looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Automatic Data Processing you should be aware of.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

The move is likely to draw more shoppers to this well-known retail destination, boding well for Macerich.Following the announcement, shares of MAC gained 1% on Mar 2 regular trading session on the NYSE.Zara, one of the largest fashion retailers worldwide, is expected to open a multi-level location.Per F.K. Grunert, executive vice president, Leasing, Macerich, “Zara is a great complement to the strong roster of shopping, dining and entertainment experiences Queens Center delivers to residents and visitors in our vibrant borough.”Macerich has a portfolio of premium assets in the United States, with a notable presence in California, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona and the Metro New York to Washington, DC corridor. These properties are located in densely populated areas, where affluent consumers with significant disposable incomes live and play, offering the company solid scope to generate decent cash flows.Located in Elmhurst, New York, Queens Center — an urban shopping center — has emerged as one of the best-performing in the Macerich portfolio of high-quality properties. It features several top retailers, including abercrombie kids, Apple, Adidas, Footlocker, Macy's, Pandora, Sephora and Victoria's Secret, and restaurants like Chick-fil-A, Shake Shack and The Cheesecake Factory.The increase in consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences following the pandemic downtime has been driving the recovery in the retail real estate industry. Retailers continue to rent out more physical store spaces to meet this growing demand.As a result, retail REITs, including Macerich, are expected to experience a rise in leasing activity and pricing power, and flourish.In 2022, the company signed 974 new and renewal leases for roughly 3.8 million square feet.

Talks resumed in June 2021.While the two sides have met regularly over the past few months, APFA said they still have ""substantive"" disagreements over many ""important"" issues, without elaborating.American Airlines said it welcomed the assistance from the National Mediation Board (NMB) to ""maintain the positive momentum"" in the negotiations.The NMB is a government agency that is entrusted with maintaining an uninterrupted flow of commerce in the airline and railway industries through representation, mediation and arbitration services.It is expected to assign a mediator who will set the timing and location of the negotiations.

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For instance, the price of O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) stock is up an impressive 236% over the last five years. Meanwhile the share price is 1.1% higher than it was a week ago.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for O'Reilly Automotive To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, O'Reilly Automotive achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 22% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 27% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of O'Reilly Automotive's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that O'Reilly Automotive shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 25% over one year. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 27% per year, is even more impressive. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - O'Reilly Automotive has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which doesn't sit too well with us)  we think you should know about.Story continuesO'Reilly Automotive is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

301,a452b452-9bfd-36d3-bcc7-796c9cefcb66,AFL,2023-03-04,Why Aflac (AFL) is a Great Dividend Stock Right Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-aflac-afl-great-dividend-164504563.html,1677861904,STORY,['AFL'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Aflac in FocusHeadquartered in Columbus, Aflac (AFL) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -6.09% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.42 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.49%. In comparison, the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield is 2.3%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.61%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 5% from last year. In the past five-year period, Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 10.76%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Aflac's current payout ratio is 30%, meaning it paid out 30% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.AFL is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.59 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 4.88%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, AFL presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have lost about 1.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Aflac due for a breakout?

The bottom line increased 0.8% year over year.AFL’s revenues dropped 26.2% year over year to $4,010 million in the quarter under review. The top line missed the consensus mark by 10.7%.Strong fourth-quarter earnings were supported by reduced benefits and expenses, and improved profit levels from the U.S. businesses. The positives were partially offset by lower net investment income and weaker performance in the Japan unit.2022 PerformanceAdjusted 2022 EPS declined 10.3% from a year ago to $5.33. Total revenues fell 11.8% to $19,502 million.

The figure, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,080.4 million.Adjusted net investment income plunged 21.7% year over year to $604 million. Pretax adjusted earnings of the segment amounted to $704 million, which tumbled 20.6% year over year in the fourth quarter.New annualized premium sales of $115 million improved 11.4% year over year. The benefit ratio of the segment was 66.2% in the fourth quarter.Story continuesAflac U.S.The segment reported adjusted revenues of $1,621 million, which climbed 0.1% year over year in the quarter under review. Total net earned premiums slid 0.2% year over year to $1,388 due to reduced year-to-date persistency. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.2%.Adjusted net investment income of $192 million slipped 2.5% year over year. Pretax adjusted earnings of the segment were $340 million, up 30.3% year over year in the fourth quarter due to reduced benefits recognized.Aflac U.S. sales of $545 million grew 17.4% year over year. The fourth-quarter benefit ratio came in at 40.8%.Financial Position (as of Dec 31, 2022)Aflac exited the fourth quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $3,943 million, which declined from $5,051 million at 2021-end. Total investments and cash of $117.4 billion declined from $143 billion at 2021-end. Total assets dropped to $131 billion from $157.5 billion a year ago.Adjusted debt decreased to $7,105 million at the fourth-quarter end from $7,568 million a year ago.Total shareholders' equity of $22,365 million plunged from $33,253 million a year ago.Adjusted debt to adjusted capitalization came in at 23.3%, which improved 60 basis points (bps) year over year.While it has no debt maturities in less than a year, total debt maturities worth $1,334 million are expected within the next five years.Adjusted book value per share increased 9.7% year over year to $43.51.Adjusted return on equity of 11.8% deteriorated 130 bps year over year.Capital DeploymentAflac bought back 8.9 million shares worth $600 million in the fourth quarter. It had 116.6 million shares left for buyback as of 2022-end.Management announced dividends of 42 cents per share for the first quarter of 2023, marking a 5% increase. The dividend will be paid out on Mar 1, 2023, to its shareholders of record as of Feb 15.OutlookAflac estimates improved sales in its Japan business for 2023, buoyed by improving pandemic conditions, product launches and product updates. The benefit ratio normalized in the fourth quarter and the momentum is expected to continue.Management also remains optimistic about strong sales results within its U.S. business. Improving productivity, contributions from platforms like network dental and vision and group life, and disability are expected to continue supporting the results.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.VGM ScoresCurrently, Aflac has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C.

We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerAflac belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry.

303,61f73d6c-ac5b-3bee-b15a-05b9f5a27ecd,AFL,2023-03-04,4 Stocks to Buy From the Prospering Accident & Health Insurance industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-buy-prospering-accident-153203100.html,1677857523,STORY,"['AFL', 'AMSF', 'UNM', '^GSPC', 'EIG']","[The Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry is expected to ride on the increase in underwriting exposure. Aflac AFL, Unum Group UNM, Employers Holdings EIG and AMERISAFE AMSF should continue benefiting from prudent underwriting standards. However, a rise in claims frequency could weigh on the positives.The industry has been witnessing soft pricing over the past several quarters, which is not expected to change any time soon. Nonetheless, a rise in claims, with business activities returning to normal levels, is likely to increase pricing for this industry. Also, the increasing adoption of technology in operations will help in the smooth functioning of the industry amid coronavirus-induced challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies providing workers’ compensation insurance, mainly to employers operating in hazardous industries. These companies offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products. Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employees’ pay. Claims are generally met by insurers or state-run workers’ compensation fund, benefiting both employers and employees. While it boosts employees’ morale, and, in turn, productivity, employers stand to benefit from lower claims costs. As awareness about the benefits of having such coverage rises, the future of these insurers seems bright. Per reports published in IBISWorld, the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry is estimated to grow 0.9% to $55 billion in 2023 based on revenues.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Accident &amp; Health Insurance IndustryPricing Pressure to Continue: The worker compensation industry has been witnessing pricing pressure over the past several quarters. Given this soft pricing, efforts to retain market share will increase pricing pressure, which might curb top-line growth.  With commercial and industrial activities back on track, the demand for insurance coverage is likely to be on the rise. SpendEdge estimates workers compensation insurance pricing to increase at a five-year (2022-2026) CAGR of 5.25%. Per a report published in Business Insurance, this line of business should continue to remain profitable in 2023 while rates should continue to trend downward.Claims Frequency Might Rise: The accident and health insurance space has witnessed growth over the years, primarily driven by an increase in benefits offered by employers. The right kind of workers’ compensation policy translates into personal care for injured workers, increased productivity, higher employee morale, lower turnover, reduced claims costs and less financial worry amid rising medical costs. Increasing underwriting exposure, sustained decrease in claims frequency rates attributable to a better working environment and conservative reserve levels have been boosting the industry’s performance. Per The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data in an AmTrust Financial report, workers over the age of 55 will increase to about 25% in 2024 from 21.7% in 2014. Thus, claims could rise based on the magnitude of severity, the report states. Also, with business activities getting normal, claims may rise.Increasing Adoption of Technology: The industry is witnessing accelerated adoption of technology in operations. Telemedicine has gained pace amid the pandemic. Carriers started selling policies online that appealed to the tech-savvy population.

The awards will be presented during the opening session of the 2023 WBCA Convention which will be held in conjunction with the NCAA® Women's Final Four in Dallas. This is in addition to Aflac's previously announced commitment to reallocate on-site activation and advertising budget to specifically focus on the women's tournament, including introducing a one-of-a-kind, on-site fan experience as part of Tourney Town at the Women's Final Four in Dallas. Finally, to address community engagement, Aflac, alongside Coach Staley, will deliver My Special Aflac Ducks® to a children's hospital to help provide support to pediatric cancer and sickle cell patients.In addition to Dawn's List off the court, Aflac is helping fans close gaps by renewing its Community CareGrants and Individual CareGrants programs, in which the company will give away $1 million in 2023 in funding that can help close the medical debt gap for vulnerable communities and individuals.ABOUT AFLAC INCORPORATED Aflac Incorporated (NYSE: AFL) is a Fortune 500 company helping provide protection to more than 50 million people through its subsidiaries in Japan and the U.S., paying cash fast when policyholders get sick or injured.

305,8331080e-534d-3f78-a7d6-2fb55b8e674e,SHW,2023-03-04,Why The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) Looks Like A Quality Company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-sherwin-williams-company-nyse-110015772.html,1677927615,STORY,['SHW'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Sherwin-Williams is:65% = US$2.0b ÷ US$3.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.65.Does Sherwin-Williams Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Sherwin-Williams has a higher ROE than the average (17%) in the Chemicals industry.roeThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Sherwin-Williams visit our risks dashboard for free.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesSherwin-Williams' Debt And Its 65% ROEIt seems that Sherwin-Williams uses a huge volume of debt to fund the business, since it has an extremely high debt to equity ratio of 3.41. While its ROE is no doubt quite impressive, it could give a false impression about the company's returns given that its huge debt could be boosting those returns.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, Veolia Environnement SA has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while American Water Works has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that VEOEY has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.VEOEY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.76, while AWK has a forward P/E of 29.08. We also note that VEOEY has a PEG ratio of 1.43. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. AWK currently has a PEG ratio of 3.60.Another notable valuation metric for VEOEY is its P/B ratio of 1.29. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, AWK has a P/B of 3.27.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, VEOEY holds a Value grade of A, while AWK has a Value grade of D.VEOEY sticks out from AWK in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that VEOEY is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In one project, the company will invest $3.5 million to construct nearly two miles of new water main in Peters Township and South Fayette to improve service reliability and fire protection for residents. In the second project, Pennsylvania American Water will invest $5.3 million to replace nearly 20,000 feet of water main in the city of Wilkes-Barre.The Pennsylvanian unit has been upgrading and maintaining its water and wastewater infrastructure by replacing old water mains methodically and has invested nearly $490 million in 2022 for infrastructure upgrades. Proper infrastructure maintenance allows the company to efficiently serve its 2.4 million customers.Upgrades Essential for Water IndustryA substantial portion of the U.S. water and wastewater infrastructure has aged and is nearing the end of its effective service life. Miles of aging pipelines essentially require repairs and upgrades to maintain quality water service. A delay in repair could cause frequent disruptions in the 24x7 supply of potable water and sewer services.Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, investments of $473 billion and $271 billion are necessary to maintain and expand drinking water and wastewater pipelines, respectively, to meet demand over the next 20 years. Water infrastructures, like storage tanks and purifying units, need maintenance at proper intervals.Utilities Making Systematic InvestmentGiven the above-mentioned scenario, it is evident that systematic investment to upgrade and maintain the old infrastructure and make provisions for adding new infrastructure will assist the operators in meeting the rising customer demand. Water utilities are making systematic investments to replace and upgrade their aging infrastructure. The U.S. government is also providing funds to upgrade and maintain the same.American Water Works aims to invest in the range of $14-$15 billion in the 2023-2027 time period and $30-$34 billion for the 10-year period of 2023-2032.

(NASDAQ:REGN) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.06bUS$4.27bUS$4.60bUS$4.72bUS$4.99bUS$5.20bUS$5.38bUS$5.54bUS$5.69bUS$5.84bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 4.06%Est @ 3.46%Est @ 3.04%Est @ 2.75%Est @ 2.55% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.8kUS$3.6kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.1kUS$3.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$35bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$124bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$124b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$64bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$99b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$779, the company appears about fair value at a 16% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.809. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Regeneron PharmaceuticalsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is Quest Diagnostics (DGX). DGX is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 15.94 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 28.86. Over the past year, DGX's Forward P/E has been as high as 18.57 and as low as 13.95, with a median of 15.63.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is DGX's P/B ratio of 2.67. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. DGX's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 3.14. DGX's P/B has been as high as 3 and as low as 2.20, with a median of 2.54, over the past year.Finally, investors will want to recognize that DGX has a P/CF ratio of 11.56.

How nice for those who held the stock!Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Ameriprise Financial was able to grow its EPS at 20% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 39% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Ameriprise Financial the TSR over the last 3 years was 186%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Ameriprise Financial shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 19%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.
