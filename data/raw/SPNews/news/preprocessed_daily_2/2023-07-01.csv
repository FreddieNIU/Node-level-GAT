Goldman's was the largest and Citigroup's was the smallest.Many also touted the results of their regulatory exams, which the Fed released on Wednesday after assessing whether 23 institutions would be able to withstand a severe global recession characterized by 10% unemployment and a 45% stock market plunge.Banks weren't allowed to return any cash to shareholders until they received a passing grade.Morgan Stanley's CEO James Gorman said on Friday that the results ""demonstrate the durability of our transformed business model."" Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said they ""demonstrate Citi’s financial resilience."" Goldman CEO David Solomon said ""we are pleased by the progress we’ve made in reducing the capital intensity of our business.""JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who runs the nation's largest bank, said the tests showed that banks are ""resilient"" and ""and continue to serve as a pillar of strength to the financial system and broader economy.""Bank of America (BAC), the nation's second-largest bank, made no announcement Friday.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.

""We take further comfort in the fact that our company-run stress test results imply significantly lower capital drawdown than the Federal Reserve’s models.""The bank with the highest capital ratio under the Fed’s ""severely adverse scenario"" was Charles Schwab (SCHW), one of the lenders that came under a lot of investor scrutiny earlier this year as other banks stumbled.""Given the anticipated changes to regulatory expectations and capital requirements, we’ll provide updates going forward regarding our capital planning and capital management priorities as conditions and requirements evolve,"" Schwab's CFO Peter Crawford said Friday.Banks are still bracing for a new set of higher capital requirements from the Fed that will force some of them to hold even greater buffers against losses.These tougher rules were already in the works before the collapse of several regional banks in the spring, but regulators made it clear in the wake of those troubles that they wanted to make sure their new approach applied to mid-sized institutions similar in size to a First Republic or a Silicon Valley Bank, which were among the banks that failed this spring.Both had more than $200 billion in assets at the time of their failures.For investors ""it seems safe to go into the water after this stress test but by no means turn your back on these two more regulatory waves coming your way,"" Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo told Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

These results included the Federal Reserve’s estimate of Schwab’s minimum capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario for the nine-quarter horizon beginning December 31, 2022 and ending March 31, 2025. Based on these results, Schwab’s calculated stress capital buffer (SCB) remains well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a SCB at that floor.This 2.5% SCB will continue to be applicable to Schwab for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2023. Schwab’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 21.4% as of March 31, 2023 was well in excess of the regulatory minimum of 4.5% combined with the SCB of 2.5% due to the relatively low risk nature of our balance sheet assets.Schwab ended the first quarter of 2023 with a consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 7.1%, down slightly from 7.2% at year-end 2022. This consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is above the long-term operating objective for CSC.CFO Peter Crawford commented, ""Schwab’s CCAR stress test results reinforce that we remain well positioned to serve our clients across a range of environments. Given the anticipated changes to regulatory expectations and capital requirements, we’ll provide updates going forward regarding our capital planning and capital management priorities as conditions and requirements evolve. Going forward, we expect to continue managing our capital position in a manner that prioritizes long-term business growth, while also supporting our common stock dividend target and overall stockholder value.""Forward-looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements relating to the company’s capital ratios; balance sheet assets; Tier 1 Leverage Ratio operating objective; positioning; regulatory changes; and capital management to support business growth, dividends, and stockholder value.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 87% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Last week’s 7.4% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The one-year return on investment is currently 25% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Texas Instruments. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Texas Instruments?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Texas Instruments. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Texas Instruments' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Texas Instruments is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.6% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.7% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.2% of the company stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Texas InstrumentsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Texas Instruments Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$201m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 13% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Texas Instruments better, we need to consider many other factors.

5,594d24e1-883d-3351-a0f0-e44f96f4f823,RRC,2023-07-01,Is Range Resources Corporation's (NYSE:RRC) Stock's Recent Performance Being Led By Its Attractive Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/range-resources-corporations-nyse-rrc-120918788.html,1688213358,STORY,['RRC'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Range Resources' (NYSE:RRC) stock increased significantly by 11% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Range Resources'  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Range Resources How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Range Resources is:64% = US$2.1b ÷ US$3.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.64 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Range Resources' Earnings Growth And 64% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Range Resources has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 32% which is quite remarkable. As a result, Range Resources' exceptional 39% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Range Resources' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 23% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for RRC? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Range Resources Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Range Resources' LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio to shareholders is 2.8%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 97% of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Additionally, Range Resources has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 8.7% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 17% over the same period.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Range Resources' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we expanded adjusted operating profit margin, both sequentially and year-over-year. We continue to grow adjusted diluted EPS, and we generated strong cash flow from operations, despite a decline in net sales. We completed the acquisition of KE2 Therm and we continued to repurchase our shares. We are making meaningful progress in both our Lighting and Spaces businesses. In the Acuity Brands Lighting and Lighting Controls business, our strategy is clear. Increased product vitality; increased service levels, and use technology to improve and differentiate both our products and our services. This quarter we launched Design Select.lights, lightingPhoto by Omar Tursić on UnsplashWe developed Design Select to elevate our service for the specification community by making it easy for them to choose superior solutions with dependable service. Design Select consists of 3,000 configurable products that meet important specification needs from some of our core families of lighting and lighting control brands including Aculux, Gotham, Lithonia Lighting, nLight and SensorSwitch. Design Select is an important addition to our service strategy. ABL Lighting and Lighting Control products are now organized into three clear categories. Contractor Select is 300 of the most important everyday lighting and lighting control products available in-stock at retailers and electrical distributors. Design Select is 3,000 configurable products that meet the key choices of lighting specifiers with dependable service, and the remainder is made to order.Through the combination of high product vitality and improved service levels with the specification community, distributors and contractors, we continue to differentiate ourselves and challenging existing industry standards. We also continue to introduce new products during the quarter. Our Luminis brand launched the inline family of exterior luminaires for use in plazas and arenas. Each light module can rotate 355 degrees and can be individually controlled, allowing installers to position the luminaire onsite for improved flexibility to create optimal illumination solutions. The recognition of our product vitality efforts is important to our team and our customers. And this quarter, several of our products won prestigious Red Dot Design awards including products from Luminis and Eureka.The Eureka Tangram-Trace was awarded a Red Dot best of the best distinction for its groundbreaking design. Other winners in this category included products from Apple, IBM and Sonos and span categories from VR headsets to first responder drug. We're proud to be in this company of innovators. Now, moving to our Intelligent Spaces Group. This was a big quarter for our spaces team both at Distech and Atrius. First on Distech. Our strategic priority is to expand our addressable market which we are doing in two-ways. The first is geographic, which continues to progress, successfully. The second is by increasing what we control in a build space. During the quarter, we announced the completion of the acquisition of KE2 Therm which allows us to expand Distech's addressable market by entering the commercial refrigeration control space.By controlling commercial refrigeration, we are able to more effectively sell the entire Distech portfolio in verticals like retail, restaurants and schools. The timing is significant as the refrigeration industry responds to the need for ultra-low global warming potential refrigerant technologies. This has led to growing demand for transcritical CO2 solutions, which require the precision of digital controls to provide safety, efficiency and reliability, while delivering cost savings to the customer. I now want to spend a few minutes on Atrius. Our strategy with Atrius has been to build a data layer that connects the edge to the cloud and use that data to develop applications that make a difference in build spaces. Earlier this month we showcased our products at the IBcon 2023 Conference in Las Vegas.This is the largest smart building conference for commercial real estate and facilities companies. At IBcon we launched Atrius DataLab, a powerful data layer that supports a portfolio of Atrius applications that is foundational to our ability to automate the environment of a built space. Atrius DataLab captures data from a building management system and organizes it in the cloud. From there, it harmonizes the data for accessibility and usefulness and creates a digital twin. Applications are then built on top of that digital twin, allowing users to analyze historic scenarios, get live updates of the current building environment and model other scenarios. This service is important because every building is different. Our Atrius applications have been built to ensure that our partners achieve their specific energy and sustainability goals through the collection, measurement and management of data in each of their built spaces.Atrius Sustainability and Atrius Energy are live and were built on the foundation of Atrius Building Insights. Atrius Sustainability is an automation tool that captures, categorizes and reports on carbon emissions within built spaces. Atrius Energy facilitates the reduction of energy and carbon usage by allowing facilities teams to benchmark their usage against science-based target. Later this year, our team will be rolling out Atrius facilities and Atrius resolve. Now, looking to the remainder of fiscal 2023. Our third quarter played out as we expected with sales being impacted by both lead-time normalization and the macro-environment. Entering our fourth quarter, we believe that there will be a continuation of these trends. While our order rates and our shipment rates are returning into closer alignment with each other, we have not yet returned to normal sequential seasonality.In ABL, we're going to focus on strategic pricing, continued productivity improvements and managing material costs. In ISG, we're going to focus on the continued growth of Distech and Atrius and the successful integration of KE2 Therm. We will continue to prioritize managing margin, generating strong cash flow and allocating capital effectively. Now I'll turn the call over to Karen, who will update you on our third quarter performance.Karen Holcom: Thank you, Neil, and good morning to everyone on the call. In the third quarter of 2023, we delivered sequential and year-over-year adjusted operating profit margin improvement despite a decline in net sales. We grew adjusted diluted earnings per share and generated strong cash flow from operations. For total AYI, we generated net sales of $1 billion, which was 6% lower than the prior year as a result of the decline in net sales in our ABL business. As Neil described, this was the result of lower volumes, consistent with lead-time normalization trends and the impact of the wider macro-environment. As we made clear on our last call, our focus is on delivering margin and operating cash flow. During the quarter, both operating profit and adjusted operating profit were flat on lower sales.We expanded adjusted operating profit margin to 16.3%, which was an increase of approximately 100 basis points over the prior year, and an improvement of 230 basis points sequentially, driven by the improvement in gross profit margin. During the quarter, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.75 increased $0.23 or 7% over the prior year. Moving to our segment performance review. ABL net sales were $941 million in the quarter, this decrease of 7% compared with the prior year was largely driven by declines in the independent sales network and lower OEM sales. This was partially offset by infrastructure projects in the direct sales network and continued strong performance in our retail channel. ABL's operating profit and adjusted operating profit were both flat on lower net sales and we delivered adjusted operating profit margin of 17% a 120 basis point improvement over the prior year and a 200 basis point improvement sequentially as price held and material input cost improves, particularly steel and inbound freight.The Spaces segment continued to perform well with another good quarter. Sales were $66 million, an increase of 13% as both Distech and Atrius continued to grow. Spaces operating profit was $9 million and adjusted operating profit was $13 million as we continued to invest in the business for longer-term growth. Now, moving to our cash-flow performance. We generated $472 million of cash flow from operating activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2023, an increase of $306 million over the same period in 2022, driven largely by improvements in working capital. We have improved both days of inventory and accounts receivable compared to the end of the year. As we've discussed on prior calls, we've continued to bring inventory down by 22 inventory days from the peak in February 2022, and we've also brought inventory levels down by over $36 million sequentially from the second quarter of fiscal 2023.Year-to-date, we invested $48 million in capital expenditures and allocated $219 million to repurchase approximately 1.3 million shares. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. We've invested for growth in our current businesses through R&amp;D and CapEx. We've expanded our platform through acquisitions as evidenced by the purchase of Optronics in our Lighting business and KE2 Therm in our Spaces business. We've maintained our dividends and we've created a permanent shareholder value with approximately $1.2 billion of share repurchases since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 at an average price of approximately $142 per share, which was funded by organic cash flow. To summarize our performance for the quarter, we delivered strong margin and cash flow despite sales being down year-over-year.Based on year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now expect full year net sales to be between $3.9 billion and $4 billion.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Unum in FocusBased in Chattanooga, Unum (UNM) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 15.65%. The insurance company is paying out a dividend of $0.33 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.78% compared to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.61% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.66%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.32 is up 4.8% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Unum has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.80%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Unum's current payout ratio is 20%, meaning it paid out 20% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.UNM is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.49 per share, with earnings expected to increase 20.61% from the year ago period.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that UNM is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It remains the Company’s intention to continue common share repurchases under its existing authorization for up to a total of $4.5 billion in 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors.State Street’s well-positioned balance sheet and strong capital position were highly resilient under the severely adverse economic conditions of the 2023 CCAR exam. State Street’s calculated SCB under this year’s supervisory stress test was well below the 2.5% minimum, preliminarily resulting in a continued SCB at that floor, which maintains our common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio requirement at 8%1.""The latest CCAR results reinforce our strategy and confirm the resiliency and strength of our franchise, which enable us to support our clients and deliver for our shareholders,"" said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ron O’Hanley. ""As we continue to repurchase our stock this year, we are pleased to announce another planned increase to our quarterly common dividend, in line with our goal of returning meaningful capital to our shareholders,"" O’Hanley added.State Street’s Board of Directors will consider the common stock dividend at a regularly scheduled board meeting in the third quarter of 2023. State Street’s third quarter 2023 common stock and other stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount, remain subject to consideration and approval by State Street’s Board of Directors at the relevant times.Stock purchases under State Street’s common share repurchase program may be made using various types of transactions, including open-market purchases, accelerated share repurchases or other transactions off the market, and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing and amount of any stock purchases and the type of transaction may not be ratable over the duration of the program, may vary from reporting period to reporting period and will depend on several factors, including State Street’s capital position and financial performance, investment opportunities, market conditions, the nature and timing of implementation of revisions to the Basel III framework and the amount of common stock issued as part of employee compensation programs. The common share repurchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.Story continuesThe Company also announced today the results of its 2023 annual stress test, with its disclosure available on the Investor Relations section of its website at http://investors.statestreet.com.Consistent with section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the results of State Street’s 2023 annual stress test released today are based on the supervisory severely adverse scenario and incorporate prescribed Dodd-Frank capital actions.

Shares have added about 7.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PVH due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.PVH Corp Q1 Earnings &amp; Revenues Beat on PVH+ PlanPVH Corporation posted solid first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the bottom and top lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. Results gained from strong execution of the PVH+ Plan and continued momentum in its core brands — Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. The company continues to manage expenses, driving cost efficiencies.Q1 HighlightsPVH Corp reported adjusted earnings of $2.14 per share, up 10% from the year-ago quarter's $1.94. Also, the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.93.In the fiscal first quarter, revenues rose 2% year over year (up 5% on a constant-currency or cc basis) to $2,158 million and surpassed the consensus mark of $2,129 million. This is mainly driven by the solid performance in its international businesses, particularly in the Asia Pacific region, continued growth in Europe and the North America direct-to-consumer business.Direct-to-consumer revenues grew 8% year over year in the quarter, whereas Wholesale revenues fell 2% year over year. Revenues in the digital channel declined roughly 3% in the quarter under review.The company's gross profit amounted to $1,250.3 million, up 0.9% year over year and surpassed our estimate of $1,240.8 million. The gross margin contracted 50 bps to 57.9% due to higher product costs, negative impact of foreign exchange and abnormally high raw material costs which more than offse. price increases, lower freight costs and a favorable shift in regional and channel mix.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2.4% year over year to $1,064 million. Earnings before interest and taxes totaled $199 million compared with $210 million in the prior-year quarter and our estimate of $252 million. This is mainly due to lower gross margins stemming from inventory costs. The metric also included $9 million of adverse foreign currency impacts.Story continuesSegmental AnalysisPVH Corp reports financial results under three segments — Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands.Revenues from the Calvin Klein segment remained flat year over year. Sales from Calvin Klein North America advanced 12%, while the same for Calvin Klein International rose 7%.Revenues from the Tommy Hilfiger segment grew 5% year over year in the reported quarter.

For fiscal 2023, revenues are anticipated to grow 3-4% (up 2-3% on a cc basis). This is in sync with our estimate.The bottom line is expected to be $10 for the year, whereas it reported $3.03 on a GAAP basis and $8.97 on an adjusted basis last year. The view includes a positive impact of 15 cents from favorable currency.The operating margin is estimated to be 10%. Interest expenses are likely to be $100 million, suggesting an increase from the prior year’s reported figure of $83 million due to higher interest rates. Also, the effective tax rate is expected to be 24%.For second-quarter fiscal 2023, management expects revenue growth in the low-single digits.

Thermo Fisher's latest modular, off-the-shelf tumoroid culture media kit, is intended to increase researchers' access to sophisticated cancer models.Significance of the New LaunchThe unpredictability of cancer is a tremendous scientific and clinical challenge for the current research as well as in providing patients with life-saving treatments. Despite decades of advancements in research, diagnostics and treatments aimed at reducing cancer mortality, millions of patients and their families worldwide continue to wait for a cure for cancer. The new OncoPro Tumoroid Culture Medium Kit is developed by Thermo Fisher so that the scientific community may benefit from tumoroid models to help bring drug ideas to the market, quickly and affordably.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTumour organoids, as opposed to their established 2D cell line equivalents, are more accurate predictors of clinical outcomes, adverse events and resistance mechanisms. Thermo Fisher’s research and drug discovery methods may easily incorporate tumoroids thanks to the OncoPro Tumoroid Culture Medium Kit.

16,d60d5f0b-97c2-392f-954a-d15e2fba1559,CTAS,2023-07-01,Cintas' (NASDAQ:CTAS) five-year earnings growth trails the strong shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cintas-nasdaq-ctas-five-earnings-110043276.html,1688209243,STORY,['CTAS'],"[The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. Long term Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 160% in five years. We note the stock price is up 3.0% in the last seven days.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Cintas While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Cintas achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 21% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Cintas, it has a TSR of 175% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Cintas shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 33% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 22% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Cintas better, we need to consider many other factors.

Instead of finding incredible bargains like $2 tops and $0.50 books, they are encountering higher prices, sometimes even surpassing the prices of new items at Walmart or Target.Check Out: 9 Things You Should Never Buy at Thrift Stores  Also: Find the Upside to Every PurchaseAs thrifting and sustainable shopping have gained popularity, particularly among Gen Z, with thrift hauls flooding TikTok, it begs the question: Why is Goodwill becoming more expensive, and are these rising prices justified?Let’s delve into the items where Goodwill might cost you more than mainstream retailers, explore the reasons behind the price hike and discover tips for staying thrifty while shopping secondhand.Also see the best days of the week for thrift shopping.Goodwill Items That Could Cost Less at Walmart and TargetNobody heads to Goodwill intending to spend more on used items than they would on new ones at Walmart or Target. However, many recent shoppers have been taken aback by overpriced items at the thrift store, making them question whether they should stick to their local mainstream retailers.Discover: 7 Things You Should Always Buy at Garage SalesDishwareGoodwill has been a go-to for those seeking unique, affordable dishes. But when it comes to basic items like jars and coffee mugs, shoppers don’t want to spend extra money when they could easily find them at Walmart or Target.“The other day I saw a freaking spaghetti sauce jar for $2.99. If you bought the actual spaghetti sauce that comes in the same jar? $1.98,” said a Reddit commenter.While browsing through the funny phrases on old coffee mugs at Goodwill can be amusing, shoppers have noticed that the high prices on these items don’t always align with their value.“I can go to Goodwill and buy someone’s old, scratched-up coffee cup for $2.29 or go to Ikea or the dollar store and buy a new one for $1,” another a Reddit user said.Story continuesSoapAlthough Goodwill can occasionally offer incredible deals, some of its pricing seems to lack thorough research.“So many things at my Goodwill I can get cheaper new,” a Reddit user said. “And some stuff I know they were selling for more than what it cost in the first place. They were trying to sell a normal bottle of soft soap for $3. At Walmart, it is $1.24.”Clothing“I was in Goodwill last week. They had used men’s boxer shorts for $4.99 each. Used! And Hanes, not a fancy designer,” a Reddit commenter said.A three-pack of Hanes boxer shorts from Walmart costs only $10.98 (or $3.66 each), making Goodwill’s prices miss the mark for shoppers seeking affordable clothing basics.“I could buy threadbare Wrangler or Rustler jeans at Goodwill for $8 a pair or buy the same clothes at Walmart for maybe a few dollars more,” said another Redditor. Why Is Goodwill More Expensive?Experienced thrifters who have been loyal to Goodwill for years have noticed the recent price hikes. But what factors are contributing to the increasing costs of items at this once budget-friendly thrift store?While some Goodwill prices may seem completely unreasonable, there appears to be a general upward trend in prices across all departments.“Goodwill’s rising prices can be attributed to several factors,” said Casey Jones, founder and head of marketing and finance at CJ&amp;CO. “Firstly, the cost of operations — including rent, utilities and wages — has increased over time. Secondly, the quality and brand of donated items can also influence pricing. High-end brands or items in excellent condition may be priced higher.“Lastly, the demand for thrifted items has grown, especially among environmentally conscious consumers, which can drive up prices.”How Shoppers Can Stay Thrifty at Thrift StoresDespite the increasing popularity and prices of secondhand shops, there are still ways for shoppers to find amazing deals while maintaining a thrifty mindset. Here are some tips.Know the ValueYou’ll want to avoid being the person who unknowingly buys bottled soap for $3 at Goodwill when it costs only $1.24 at Walmart.“Understand the retail price of items to ensure you’re getting a good deal,” Jones said.Shop on Discount DaysMaximize your savings by shopping on discount days. Visit your local Goodwill to find out which days offer markdowns on specific categories.“Many thrift stores, including Goodwill, have discount days where certain items or categories are marked down,” Jones said.Additionally, Goodwill stores often provide military, veteran, student and senior discounts on specific days of the week (discounts vary by store and location).Explore Other Thrift Stores“Prices can vary greatly between different thrift stores,” Jones said. “Local, non-chain thrift stores often have lower prices.”Take a look at St. Vincent De Paul, The Salvation Army, Savers and other boutiques in your area to compare prices and find a thrift store that fits your secondhand budget.Secondhand Alternatives to GoodwillIn today’s digital age, thrift stores are no longer limited to brick-and-mortar establishments. Online thrift websites, where anyone can buy and sell clothing, have contributed to the rise of online thrift shopping, offering increasing competition to Goodwill.“Local thrift stores, consignment shops and online platforms like eBay, Poshmark and ThredUP offer a wide variety of secondhand items,” Jones said. “Garage sales and estate sales can also be great sources of low-cost items.”More From GOBankingRates9 Ways To Make $200 (or More) a Day Running Errands9 Middle-Class Money Traps That Keep You From Being Wealthy3 Ways to Recession Proof Your RetirementThe 10 Most Profitable Small Business Ideas for 2023This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Goodwill Is Becoming More Expensive Than Walmart and Target]"

Shares have added about 26% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Nordstrom due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Nordstrom Gains as Q1 Earnings &amp; Sales Beat EstimatesNordstrom posted first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line improved year over year, while the top line declined.Results benefited from continued progress in its key initiatives, improved trends at Nordstrom Rack, gross margin expansion and supply-chain efficiencies. These were partly offset by the effects of the wind-down of its Canada business.Nordstrom posted adjusted earnings of 7 cents per share against the year-ago quarter’s loss per share of 6 cents. Earnings per share also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 12 cents.Total revenues of $3,181 million declined 11.6% year over year but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,113 million. Dismal revenues resulted from a 175-basis point (bps) adverse impact of the wind-down of Canada operations and an 11.9% decline in gross merchandise value (GMV). Sales were also hurt by declines across the Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack banners.Quarterly HighlightsNet sales fell 11.6% year over year to $3,064 million but surpassed our estimate of $3,012.8 million. Credit Card net revenues grew 14.7% year over year to $117 million and beat our estimate of $107.4 million.In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, net sales for the Nordstrom banner decreased 11.4% from the year-ago quarter to $2,027 million but surpassed our estimate of $1,990.6 million. GMV declined 11.8% year over year for the Nordstrom banner in the fiscal first quarter. The Nordstrom banner’s net sales included a negative impact of 270 bps related to the wind-down of the Canada operations.Sales at the Nordstrom Rack banner declined 11.9% year over year to $1,037 million but beat our estimate of $1,022.1 million. The elimination of store fulfillment for Nordstrom Rack digital orders starting from the third quarter of fiscal 2022 hurt fiscal first-quarter Rack banner net sales by 600 bps.Digital sales plunged 17.4% year over year in the fiscal first quarter due to the elimination of store fulfillment for Nordstrom Rack digital orders in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and the quitting of Trunk Club earlier in fiscal 2022. These actions hurt fiscal first-quarter digital sales by 800 bps. In the fiscal first quarter, digital sales contributed 36% to net sales.Nordstrom's gross profit margin expanded 110 bps year over year to 33.8% for the reported quarter, mainly driven by the company’s focus on enhancing inventory productivity.SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 240 bps to 36%. The adjusted SG&amp;A expense rate rose 120 bps due to deleverage from lower sales, offset by improved variable costs from supply-chain efficiency initiatives.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Royal Caribbean (RCL) earns a Zacks Rank #1 27 days from its next quarterly earnings release on July 27, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.59 a share.RCL has an Earnings ESP figure of 5.05%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.59 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51.RCL is one of just a large database of Consumer Discretionary stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH).Norwegian Cruise Line, which is readying to report earnings on August 8, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.26 a share, and NCLH is 39 days out from its next earnings report.Norwegian Cruise Line's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.55% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.26.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, RCL and NCLH could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.MetLife in FocusHeadquartered in New York, MetLife (MET) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -22.37% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.52 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.7%. In comparison, the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield is 2.26%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.66%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.08 is up 5.1% from last year. Over the last 5 years, MetLife has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 4.28%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. MetLife's current payout ratio is 32%. This means it paid out 32% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.MET is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.74 per share, with earnings expected to increase 12.99% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MET is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Days after the leak began, ConocoPhillips rerouted much of the escaping gas to the Alpine gas processing facility, but small amounts continued to leak intermittently for weeks.There were no reports of injuries during the leak, but it caused the temporary removal of 300 personnel as well as alarmed residents in the nearby village of Nuiqsut, and it halted oil production from the drill site.The Environmental Protection Agency is also conducting an investigation into the event, according to the state agency's notice.ConocoPhillips is reviewing the commission's notice and its findings from the investigation, said Rebecca Boys, a spokeswoman with the oil company.""We remain committed to working with the AOGCC and to implementing our learnings into our future projects and operations,"" she said in an emailed statement. ""We recognize that it's a privilege to operate on the North Slope and in Alaska.""Brett Huber, chair of the commission, said the nearly $1 million proposed civil penalty comes after the agency's investigation into the causes of the incident and a March 23 public hearing in which the agency heard from ConocoPhillips officials.Huber said Conoco ""was at all times cooperative"" with the agency during the investigation, participated in the hearing, and voluntarily implemented new policies and procedures to prevent similar incidents in the future.Story continues[Alaska Supreme Court hears arguments in city of Valdez's effort to unlock Hilcorp financial secrets]Houston, Texas-headquartered ConocoPhillips, the state's top oil producer, produces about 175,000 barrels of crude oil daily. It earned $2.4 billion in Alaska last year, and invested $1.1 billion in capital projects. The company owns the controversial Willow oil field project, approved earlier this year by the Biden administration, though the project still faces a court challenge brought by conservation groups.In its notice, the three-member agency said it now describes the leak as a ""shallow underground blowout"" of a well because gas was released uncontrollably at the surface for days across various locations. The agency had originally referred to the event as a ""gas release.""ConocoPhillips has previously said its operations to pump 170 barrels of diesel fuel into a disposal well to prevent freezing increased pressure in the well and initiated the leak. The well is known as WD-03, and is part of the CD1 drilling pad, a 500-foot-long strip of dozens of wells on the tundra.The state agency's notice says the company observed elevated pressure in the well during those operations, but took no action to evaluate the cause. After the freeze-protection operations, the company, in the days before the leak was detected, did not recognize or address pressure increases in the well, a violation of law, the notice says.The pressure caused fracturing of an underground area near the well, the notice says. A surface casing shoe, a protective feature of the well, was also fractured.The fracturing of the shoe created a pathway for the underground gas ""to migrate upward to a thaw bulb"" and eventually into the atmosphere, the notice says. A ""thaw bulb"" occurs when permafrost near a wellbore melts from the movement of warm fluids associated with oil and gas activity.""The presence of a thaw bulb at the CD1 Drill Site provided a path of little resistance either horizontally or vertically to the movement of gas that was released from (the well) into the subsurface strata and explains why the first observed gas released at surface was about 450 feet away,"" the report says.The gas was able to ""move freely beneath the drill site from higher to lower pressure until it found a route to the atmosphere,"" the report says.The gas also appeared elsewhere on the drill site, but the notice says no natural gas was detected outside the CD1 drill site.The majority of the proposed fine, $760,000, is associated with ConocoPhillips' failure to install cement around a portion of the waste disposal well where the blowout occurred.The company began drilling the well several weeks before the incident. The cement could have confined gas from a shallow underground zone to the wellbore, preventing the widespread release of gas, the enforcement action indicates.ConocoPhillips had historically understood, based on geologic evaluation, that the underground zone did not contain significant amounts of natural gas or abnormally high pressures. As a result, the oil company did not consider it necessary to place cement in that portion of the wellbore, the enforcement action says.Nonetheless, there were indications from other nearby wells that the underground zone contained a ""shallow gas accumulation,"" according to the notice. The zone, called C10/Halo by ConocoPhillips, is located about a half-mile below the ground. The company had planned to drill the disposal two miles deep before the leak occurred.The agency also set a $100,000 fine because ConocoPhillips did not follow the plan during its freeze-protection operation, the notice says.The agency set a $34,000 fine for waste, double the market value of the wasted gas, in part because the release was not initially controlled.ConocoPhillips also faces $20,000 in penalties for its response actions. The company failed to seek approval of an alternate safety valve system and for failing to test the well safety valve systems used in the response.Lois Epstein, who owns LNE Engineering and Policy and provides consulting services for conservation groups and tribes, said she hopes the oil and gas conservation commission will strengthen the regulations to make sure the improvements by ConocoPhillips to prevent future incidents apply to other oil producers.The need for proper identification of potentially dangerous gas zones and proper protections with cementing are critical, she said. So is making sure that procedures are properly followed when fluids are pumped into wells and pressure limits are exceeded, she said.Epstein said the commission's penalty could have been higher, too, considering that important steps weren't taken that could have prevented the incident, such as ConocoPhillips' failure to communicate pressure limits to field personnel, another finding in the report.Epstein credited the agency for producing a strong summary of events in its notice. She said it's notable that it provided daily incident reports for the first time last year during the event, helping the public. She said ConocoPhillips also took important steps in quickly releasing a summary of what went wrong.The agency's notice was signed by Huber and Commissioner Jessie Chmielowski. Commissioner Greg Wilson, a longtime former ConocoPhillips geologist appointed to the commission last fall, recused himself from the proceedings.According to the notice, ConocoPhillips will have 15 days to challenge the fine, a standard part of the agency process.The commission has posted documents and public records gathered during its investigation at a state website.]"

Claudio Galimberti, Rystad Energy SVP and Head of Americas Research, joins Yahoo Finance Live to examine crude oil inventory outlooks and how EVs and electrification trends could weigh on energy markets.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Welcome back. Oil prices are on the move this morning. And moving higher as we near the end of the first half of 2023. And Brent crude has had a rocky start. On track for its worst run of quarterly losses on record, as elevated supply and concerns over demand hit prices.Let's bring in Claudio Lamberti, who is the Rystad Energy SVP and Head of Americas Research for more on this. All right. So just broad strokes here, what most notably should we take away from or extrapolate from the first half of 2023?CLAUDIO LAMBERTI: Thank you for inviting me back. Well, it's been indeed a rocky ride for the past six months. Because you will recall that we started the year at a much higher level. And then, there has been for the past, I would say, two quarters a negative risk premium in the market. There has been a lot of uncertainty about one key demand area, which is China.Now, we need to be aware that the first quarter of China, when I look at the actual data, was actually strong. And the real-time data that we have also shows that the situation in China is still under control. There also is a question about the OPEC plus, what OPEC plus is doing. One thing are the pledges. Another thing is the total oil, which is produced.But what I would say is that we are probably going into his second half of the year when we will see tightening balances. So it means that our focus for oil prices is upwards. But indeed, as you pointed out, a lot of contrasting factors in the first half. And that's the reason why we have been seeing the oil price going up and down. Currently, 75.So it does look though, that there is some a floor to the oil price. And that's due to the determination of Saudi Arabia and the OPEC Plus to keep the oil prices above that level.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: And Claudio, what do you think will change that? Because to your point, we already have seen some discipline on the part of OPEC Plus, and, particularly, in Saudi Arabia. But all that's done is place a floor. It hasn't certainly caused oil prices to take off. So where do you see more supply coming out of the market that might cause that?CLAUDIO LAMBERTI: Well, first of all, Saudi Arabia made it very clear that between now and the end of the year, they can voluntarily and unilaterally take off the market, every month, a million barrels. So that's what I would call a very strong put option. I wouldn't bet against it. Because one million barrels a day is a lot of volume that comes off. So I do not expect oil prices to fall below $70 per barrel. Unless, we are going to see very negative data from China or from other parts of the world.So that is the point number one. I would say that we also need to take into consideration what's happening in other producing part of the world. For instance, in the United States, we haven't seen a whole lot of growth. And that is very important, if you ask me. And the reason for that is that it gives the OPEC Plus the confidence that they can cut volume, they can reduce volume without the fear, without the risk of losing market share to taxes to the United States.So these two gives me confidence that we will see prices going upwards. But the most important thing in the trading community is the inventory. So we are yet to see inventories, significant inventory draws globally. We saw some significant inventory drop this week in the United States. And that resulted in the Brent and WTI bouncing back up by 3%, 4%.The moment we see the global crude inventories to drop and to draw significantly and consistently, this is the point in time when I expect really strong backwardation, which, at the end of the day, means higher oil prices.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And so what about countries like, Iraq and Nigeria trying to offset, especially some of the Saudi cuts? What's that going to do to demand when you factor in things like electrification and, perhaps, reduce demand overall as people start to pivot to some of these other vehicles?CLAUDIO LAMBERTI: Well, this is an excellent question. Thank you for asking that. The way I put it is as follows. We have seen a lot of electrification in the past five years. So as a matter of fact, the pace of electrification globally has been exponential. We're sending 1% of electric vehicle in terms of global sales in 2018 and 16% last year.So it means that every year, it basically doubled. The problem is that we are already seeing a plateauing of those sales. So year-to-date, the total global sales of electric vehicle is below 16. It's actually 14%. So there is some problem there. It can be fixed, of course. But the pace of electrification is slowing down, at least, so far this year.The second is I would say, what is the total effect on our demand? So far, it's very limited. So we're talking about the zero point percentage effect on our demand. So you can already see. But you really need to use the microscope because imagine global demand is still enormous. More than a million barrels per day and the effect of electrification is in the order of a few 100,000 barrels per day.But there is another effect, which I think is more important. So if people and investors think that the electrification is displacing a lot of demand, and it is not, at least, in the short, medium term might not be willing to invest in oil production. So you may have a counter effect. As a matter of fact, a counterintuitive effect, which is-- the electrification, yes, will have an effect. But the effect is probably be seen five years from now.And if you stop investing, then, because you fear that there is already very strong electrification, then you might end up with under-investment in the next few years, so in the short to medium term.But, overall, what I would say as far as the electrification is concerned is that it is going on for sure.

The U.S. crude benchmark was up 2.1% for the week and 3.7% for the month. But for the quarter, it was down 6.6%, while for the year, it showed a loss of almost 14%.London-traded Brent crude settled up 56 cents, or 0.8%, at $74.90 per barrel. The global crude benchmark showed a gain of 1.5% for the week and 3.8% for the month. For the quarter, it slid 6.1%, while for the year, it showed a deficit of 12.8%.“The first half of the oil story shows disappointed oil bulls with concerns about rising interest rates, Federal Reserve officials promising a slowdown in the economy, bank failures, perceived weakness in Chinese oil demand and the inability to rein in sanctioned oil from Russia and Iran,” said Phil Flynn, energy analyst at the Price Futures Group in Chicago.But Flynn, also an ardent oil bull, said the second half could be a story “radically different” and positive for those long crude as the current supply surplus in the market “may turn into a deep deficit.”Oil bulls count on upcoming Saudi cutsThe bull thesis for oil in the second half is held up by expectations that major producer Saudi Arabia will cut production meaningfully to bring Brent to above $80 a barrel and WTI to at least $75.The Saudis, who lead the 23-nation alliance of oil producers called OPEC+, have announced three production cuts since October that would theoretically remove 2.5 million barrels per day from their production, bringing output to just around 9 million daily barrels in July.Story continuesBut crude prices have only rallied briefly after each of those announcements as rate hikes by the Fed and other central banks have become a factor for the oil market which fears a worldwide economic slowdown that could impact energy demand.A panel discussion on Wednesday hosted by the European Central Bank and including the heads of the Federal Reserve, Bank of England and Bank of Japan, showed nearly all on board with higher interest rates to curb higher-than-expected inflation.Fed Chair Powell followed that up on Thursday by telling a banking event in Madrid that the U.S. central bank was trying to find the level for rates that will restrain economic activity and inflation without causing unnecessary weakness.Latest U.S. gross domestic product data released on Thursday also showed more resilience than thought in the economy, a development that could put more winds behind the Fed’s rate hike sails.U.S. GDP grew by an annualized 2% in the first quarter of this year, the Commerce Department said Thursday in a revelation likely to add to the Federal Reserve’s relief that its rate hikes had not weighed too much on growth.Economists polled by US media had forecast a year-on-year growth of only 1.4% on the average for the January-March period. The Commerce Department’s prior growth estimate for the quarter was just 1.3%.Fed action still something to fearThe Fed has been seeking instead for a “soft landing” of the economy, which translates to slower but not negative GDP growth. The latest quarterly result indicates that the central bank might just get its wish.Offsetting some of that hawkish Fed mode was inflation data on Friday that came in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, Index. The index, a U.S. inflation indicator closely followed by the Fed, grew 3.8% in the year to May, in line with expectations and below the key 4% level for the first time in more than two years.Aside from global monetary tightening, traditional sources of demand for energy — especially from China, the number one importer of oil — haven’t been as encouraging as thought in the first six months of the year.Notwithstanding that, Flynn and like-minded analysts think demand for oil could turn the corner in the remainder of the year.“Oil’s fourth straight quarterly decline should be its last one. WTI crude is trying to stabilize above the $70 level as the oil market is destined for a deficit in the second half of the year,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.“The crude demand outlook has too much doom and gloom priced in as the US and China outlooks should remain upbeat. China might be buying cheaper discounted Russian crude, but soon they will require more and those purchases could broaden as they slowly deliver more economic stimulus. The key for oil will be if the Saudis remain aggressive in getting this market tighter with an extension or slightly deeper output cuts,” Moya added.Related ArticlesOil rallies on softer U.S. inflation but down as much as 14% at half-yearOil settles higher but posts fourth straight quarterly declineNatural gas down almost 40% at half-year mark despite big June gain]"
37,a9865128-50fc-3d07-815e-44aac7c88395,O,2023-07-01,Energy Agencies Are Conflicted About Rising Oil Demand,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-agencies-conflicted-rising-oil-150000817.html,1688137200,STORY,"['CL=F', 'NG=F']","[The International Energy Agency (IEA) announced that it expected global oil demand to peak at the end of the decade earlier this month. Meanwhile, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said oil demand could reach 110 bpd by 2045, above the peak IEA estimate. But if these major international agencies cannot get on the same page, how can there be a clear fossil fuel outlook?Earlier in June, the IEA stated that it believed peak oil demand was “in sight” and could be achieved before 2030. Despite a rebound in global energy demand since the Covid pandemic, the rise in renewable energy capacity and acceleration of the green transition is expected to lead to a steady decline in growth for fossil fuels, particularly coal and oil. Concerns over energy security due to last year’s shortages, as well as a global economic crisis, are expected to contribute to this waning demand, as governments pump funding into long-term energy security via the green energy sector.Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, stated “The shift to a clean energy economy is picking up pace, with a peak in global oil demand in sight before the end of this decade as electric vehicles, energy efficiency and other technologies advance.” Global oil demand is expected to increase by 2.4 million bpd this year to a record 102.3 million bpd, according to the IEA. This growth could fall to 860,000 bpd in 2024 and 400,000 bpd by 2028, to a total global demand of 105.7 million bpd.The IEA suggested this dip in growth was largely owing to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which threatened energy security and led to a shortage of fossil fuels last year, as well as the $2 trillion earmarked for clean energy projects by the end of the decade. It expects the global demand for oil from combustible fossil fuels, not including biofuels, petrochemical feedstocks and other non-energy uses, will peak at 81.6 million bpd in 2028.Story continuesWhile the IEA expects the global oil demand for transport to fall after 2026, it is the petrochemicals sector that will continue to keep oil demand high. The organisation expects the growth of the electric vehicle (EV) market to support a transition away from fossil fuel-powered cars, which will be further supported by government and local climate policies. However, “burgeoning petrochemical demand and strong consumption growth in emerging and developing economies will more than offset a contraction in advanced economies”, according to the group.Meanwhile, OPEC believes global oil demand will rise to as high as 110 million bpd by 2045, increasing the world’s oil demand by 23% from now. Haitham Al Ghais, the Secretary General of OPEC, statedthat ″Oil is irreplaceable for the foreseeable future” during the inaugural Energy Asia conference this month. Al Ghais suggested that in two decades, oil will still comprise around 29 percent of the global energy mix.This outlook is contradictory to the IEA’s global oil demand prediction. Al Ghais also suggested that a lack of investment in the oil industry will not stop this growth in demand, but it could lead to “energy chaos”. He expects rapid urbanisation to contribute significantly to the rise in oil demand worldwide. However, the Secretary-General does acknowledge the growing role that renewables will have in the global energy mix, suggesting that OPEC member states are already investing substantially in green energy. As well as oil, he expects natural gas, hydrogen, nuclear power, hydrogen, and biomass to also expand.By the end of last year, the global renewable energy generation capacity totalled 3372 GW, marking a growth of 295 GW, or 9.6 percent. Around 83 percent of all power capacity added in 2022 was produced by renewable sources. The sector is continuing to grow at record levels thanks to cohesion across several state governments and the launch of climate policies supporting an accelerated green transition. This has led to a downward trend in fossil fuel power generation, as well as a diversification of energy investment, even by some of the world’s biggest oil and gas majors.The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Director-General Francesco La Camera stated: “This continued record growth shows the resilience of renewable energy amidst the lingering energy crisis.” Camera added, “The strong business case of renewables coupled with enabling policies has sustained an upward trend of their share in the global energy mix year on year. But annual additions of renewable power capacity must grow three times the current level by 2030 if we want to stay on a pathway limiting global warming to 1.5°C.”However, much of the renewable energy capacity growth is happening in a select few countries, mainly concentrated within some of the world’s strongest economies and regions, including Asia, Europe, and the USA. To ensure that the global renewable energy capacity continues to grow at this rate, the world’s developed economies need to invest in poorer regions, to meet the growing demand for clean energy. If this does not happen, it could lead to the OPEC prediction of long-term oil demand growth being accurate. While the optimistic IEA forecast could be correct if the global renewable energy capacity continues to grow at a rapid rate, any slowing of this could lead to a more pessimistic outcome.By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Sanctioned Goods Are Sneaking Into Russia Through KazakhstanAustria’s Foreign Minister Will Not Attend OPEC Conference Amid Media BanUkraine To Receive Military Support 'For As Long As It Takes'Read this article on OilPrice.com]"

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Interpublic Group IPG and Omnicom Group OMC.Here is a synopsis of all four stocks.Bull of the Day:Headquartered in Texas, Wingstop offers cooked-to-order, hand-sauced, tossed chicken wings, and other similar food items. Currently, the stock sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with earnings expectations increasing across the board.Aside from the improved earnings outlook, let’s look at several other aspects of WING shares.Current StandingWING is a solid consideration for any growth-focused investor; estimates for its current fiscal year (FY23) reflect 15% earnings growth on 20% higher revenues. Peering ahead to FY24, earnings and revenue are forecasted to witness growth of 16% and 14%, respectively.Wingstop carries a Style Score of “A” for Growth.Still, the stock may not entice those focusing on value, with the present 14.1X forward price-to-sales sitting on the high end of the spectrum. Still, investors have had little issue forking up the premium given the company’s growth, with WING shares up 40% year-to-date and crushing the S&amp;P 500’s impressive 16% gain.The stock carries a Style Score of “F” for Value.It’s worth watching for the company’s next quarterly release expected on July 27th; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.50 suggests an 11% improvement in earnings from the year-ago period. Analysts have been bullish, with the quarterly estimate being revised 11% higher since April of this year.In addition, our consensus revenue estimate for the upcoming quarter to be reported stands at $104.3 million, 25% higher than the year-ago quarter. The quarterly sales estimate has also enjoyed positive revisions, up 4% since April.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.Additionally, the top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.Wingstop would be an excellent stock for investors to keep on their watchlists, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bear of the Day:The Mosaic Company is a leading producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash for the global agriculture industry. The company is the biggest integrated phosphate producer globally and among the four largest potash producers worldwide.Analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company’s earnings outlook, pushing the stock into an unfavorable Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Let’s take a closer look at the company.Current StandingThe company posted mixed results in its latest quarterly release, falling short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by nearly 11%. In fact, Mosaic has struggled to exceed earnings expectations consistently, carrying a -10.8% average EPS surprise over its last four quarters.Still, revenue results have been more positive, with MOS exceeding sales estimates in back-to-back quarters.The company’s growth is expected to taper off, with estimates indicating a 60% pullback in earnings on 30% lower revenues for its current fiscal year (FY23). And in FY24, projections allude to a further 20% decline in the bottom line on 13% lower sales.Analysts have been bearish for some time now, with the $4.49 per share estimate being revised more than 60% lower since June of 2022.Shares do pay a solid dividend, currently yielding 2.4% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 10% of the company's earnings. Dividend growth is also there, with the company sporting a sizable 53% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Bottom LineNegative earnings estimate revisions from analysts and weak quarterly results paint a challenging picture for the company’s shares in the near term.The Mosaic Company is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company’s earnings outlook.For those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.Additional content:2 Dividend-Paying Stocks to Benefit from the Advertising MarketThe Zacks advertising and marketing industry is currently in good shape. The upside was backed by the advertising revenue trend in the United States. Per Statista, advertising revenues increased from $194.7 billion in 2014 to $343.5 billion in 2022, delivering a constant growth except 2020 when the industry took a hit due to the pandemic.We believe this is the appropriate time to invest in a booming market and pick regular dividend-paying stocks. Dividends create a reliable source of return without selling shares.Industry and Its TrendsPer Statista, advertising revenues are expected to reach $424.3 billion by 2027. Internet advertising has been gradually replacing traditional TV advertising, contributing nearly 63% to advertisement revenues in 2022. The metric is expected to be 68% by 2027. Online advertising revenues have seen a surge in the past five years, growing 130% to nearly $210 billion in 2022. The inclusion of artificial intelligence is adding to the growth of online advertising. Paid search, podcasts and videos are some of the main avenues of digital ad spend.In the past year, the advertising and marketing industry has rallied 24.2% compared with the S&amp;P 500 composites’ 14.6% increase and the Business Services sector’s 3.6% rise.Why Dividends?In case of market volatility, dividend stocks can be a go to option for investors. With the volatility currently involved in U.S. markets, investing in fundamentally strong stocks with a good track record of dividend payment seems to be the best idea. Dividend-paying companies are likely to recover faster after a major correction in the market compared with its non-dividend-paying peers.Stock PicksStocks from the expanding advertising and marketing industry that pay regular dividends and exhibit fundamental strength include Interpublic Group and Omnicom Group. They belong to the broader Business Services sector and currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

43,ff4ec7ca-9633-336b-a841-885ed1e85be3,FE,2023-07-01,"Ex-Ohio GOP chair, lobbyist Matt Borges shows remorse, gets 5 years for role in $60M bribery scheme",AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ex-ohio-gop-chair-lobbyist-164426759.html,1688143466,STORY,['FE'],"[CINCINNATI (AP) — Ohio lobbyist Matt Borges was sentenced Friday to five years in prison for his part in the largest corruption scandal in Ohio history. He avoided the much harsher sentence received a day earlier by former House Speaker Larry Householder, the scheme's mastermind, by accepting responsibility and apologizing before the judge.“Nothing makes it feel more stark than knowing I could have walked away from this at the very beginning,” the 51-year-old Borges, a former chair of the Ohio Republican Party, told U.S. District Judge Timothy Black.Black nonetheless rebuked Borges for his role in preventing Ohioans the chance to repeal a tainted nuclear plant bailout bill.“Larry Householder was a crook and you knew it. ' An unholy alliance ' is what you called it,” Black said.“You didn't care that you were aiding an Ohio House speaker to undermine the very foundation of our democracy,"" he told Borges. ""You just saw everyone else getting fat and rich, and you wanted a piece of it.”Black admitted to being moved by Borges’ contrition, however, which may have contributed to him escaping the top of the 5- to 8-year range federal prosecutors sought. But the judge rejected any notion that Borges should only get the six months offered to cooperative witnesses or the 1 1/2 years sought by his attorneys, and ordered him into immediate custody.As a handcuffed Borges left the courtroom, he looked back at his wife Kate, who had delivered an impassioned plea for leniency to the judge, and could be heard saying, “Bye, babe.” She blew him a kiss.A jury convicted Householder and Borges in March, determining that Householder orchestrated and Borges participated in a $60 million bribery scheme secretly funded by Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. to secure Householder’s power, elect his allies and pass and defend a $1 billion nuclear plant bailout. Specifically, Borges was found to have offered a bribe in exchange for inside information on a referendum campaign aimed at repealing the bailout law.Story continuesHouseholder, 64, was sentenced to 20 years, the maximum allowed, on Thursday.During the trial, Borges sought to distance himself from Householder — once one of Ohio’s most powerful Republican politicians — with his defense team highlighting his absence from meetings held by Householder’s allies and Borges quipping audibly in the courtroom that he didn’t even like the man.After Householder confirmed on the stand during their trial that Borges was not among his confidantes, the younger Republican opted against testifying on his own behalf at that time.Black said Friday that Borges' expunged conviction years ago in a state government pay-to-play scandal didn't play a significant role in his sentence this time.Borges, who served as a campaign staffer and chief of staff to then-Republican State Treasurer Joe Deters, pleaded guilty in 2004 to one count of improper use of a public office. He was fined $1,000, but avoided jail time of up to six months.Borges was charged with giving 10 brokers who had contributed to Deters’ campaign fund an advantage in getting contracts with the office of the treasurer — Ohio’s chief investment officer. A Deters fundraiser and a lobbyist who served as a go-between to the preferential treatment also were convicted.Though Deters was never directly connected to the scheme, it stymied his career in state politics for almost two decades. That was, until GOP Gov. Mike DeWine named him in December to an open seat on the Ohio Supreme Court.Because of his association with Borges, Deters has recused himself from a separate state case against FirstEnergy stemming from the scandal that’s been appealed to the high court.U.S. Attorney Kenneth Parker said he was gratified that Borges showed remorse during Friday's hearing, including saying how disappointed he was in himself and apologizing in open court to adversaries he lashed out at through a dedicated website.“That's the first step to rehabilitation, so I was glad to see that,” Parker said. “He, and only he, knows whether or not it was genuine. But that's the first step to making things right, inside and outside.”Householder and Borges were among five people arrested by federal authorities in July 2020, charged along with a dark money group, for their roles in the wide-ranging scheme. A federal investigation remains ongoing.Two others — Juan Cespedes and Jeff Longstreth — have pleaded guilty and are cooperating as they await sentences of up to six months in prison. A third man, the late Statehouse superlobbyist Neil Clark, pleaded not guilty before dying by suicide in 2021. Generation Now, the 501(c) nonprofit through which much of the money flowed, also has pleaded guilty to racketeering.FirstEnergy also has admitted to its role, admitting in an agreement with the government to using dark money groups to fund the effort and agreeing to pay a $230 million fine and meet other conditions in order to avoid prosecution.]"

(NYSE:CRM) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 81% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-nyse-crm-largely-120033555.html,1688212833,STORY,['CRM'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Salesforce's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 25 shareholders own 49% of the company Insiders have been selling lately A look at the shareholders of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 81% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Salesforce. View our latest analysis for Salesforce ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Salesforce?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Salesforce does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Salesforce's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Salesforce is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.5%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.7% by the third-largest shareholder. In addition, we found that Marc Benioff, the CEO has 2.7% of the shares allocated to their name.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of SalesforceWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.We can report that insiders do own shares in Salesforce, Inc.. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$6.4b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Salesforce. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Salesforce better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Salesforce , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Shares have lost about 1.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Salesforce.com due for a breakout?

The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61.The quarterly non-GAAP earnings were adversely impacted by a loss of 11 cents per share from mark-to-mark accounting of CRM’s strategic investments at a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%. However, the company’s ongoing restructuring initiative, which includes trimming the workforce, benefited first-quarter non-GAAP earnings by 72 cents per share.Salesforce’s quarterly revenues of $8.25 billion climbed 11% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.17 billion. The top line also improved 13% in constant currency.The company has been benefiting from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Thus, the rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions resulted in the better-than-anticipated performance in the fiscal first quarter.Quarterly DetailsComing to CRM’s business segments, revenues from Subscription and Support (93% of the total revenues) increased 11.5% from the year-earlier period to $7.64 billion.

Moreover, the non-GAAP operating margin expanded 1,000 bps to 27.6% from 17.6% in the year-ago quarter due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of total sales. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to 69% from 72% in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet &amp; Other DetailsSalesforce exited the fiscal first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $14 billion, up from the $12.5 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter.CRM generated operating cash flow of $4.49 billion and free cash flow of $4.25 billion in the first quarter.As of Apr 30, 2023, the current remaining performance obligation reflecting revenues under contract for the next 12 months was $24.1 billion, up 12% on a year-over-year basis.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Salesforce.com has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerSalesforce.com belongs to the Zacks Computer - Software industry.

With a heat wave hitting California, bringing temperatures into the triple digits in many areas, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) urges its customers to celebrate safely and responsibly. Electric hazards, heat-related illnesses and water and fire risks can occur if proper precautions aren't taken.Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PRNewsfoto/Pacific Gas and Electric Company)PG&amp;E offers the following tips to help customers stay safe this Independence Day and throughout the summer:OUTAGE SAFETYTransformers, which distribute power to homes and businesses, need a period of time when they can cool down during a heat wave. This usually happens overnight when energy usage and temperatures drop. Heat events with sustained high overnight temperatures can put stress on transformers, causing them to fail. In case of heat-related outages, PG&amp;E offers the following safety tips:Use battery-operated flashlights, and not candles, due to the risk of fire.Customers with generators should make sure they are properly installed by a licensed electrician in a well-ventilated area.Freeze plastic containers filled with water to make blocks of ice that can be placed in your refrigerator/freezer during an outage to prevent foods from spoiling.Customers can get updates on outages in their neighborhood through a variety of channels.HEAT SAFETYLimit exposure to direct sunlight between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., and wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a protection factor of at least 15. Reapply sunscreen often.Drink plenty of water and avoid alcohol or caffeine when temperatures are high.During hot weather, watch for signs of heat stroke—hot, red skin; changes in consciousness; rapid, weak pulse; rapid, shallow breathing. If it's suspected someone is suffering from heat stroke, call 9-1-1 and move the person to a cooler place and use cold towels to help lower their body temperature until help arrives.Story continuesFIREWORKS SAFETYThe safest way to enjoy fireworks is to attend a public fireworks show put on by professionals.Make yourself aware of your surroundings—stay clear of powerlines, structures, dry grass or flammable materials when shooting your own fireworks in areas approved by local regulations.If a firework strikes electric equipment or causes a powerline to come down, stay away, keep others away and immediately call 911 and PG&amp;E at 1-800-743-5000. Always assume downed electric lines are energized and extremely dangerous. Never attempt to retrieve anything that is tangled in or near a powerline.SUMMER SAFETYKeep alert for local weather conditions. Check to see if any warning signs or flags are posted at beaches or parks you're visiting.Make sure everyone has proper skills to swim and keep an eye on young children and check flotation devices for leaks.Every child under 13 must wear a Coast Guard-approved life jacket when on a moving vessel that is 26 feet or less in length.Don't dive or jump into unfamiliar water. Shallow water or submerged trees or rocks could cause serious injury.Don't swim or play near a dam or powerhouse; these areas can have strong underwater currents, sudden water discharges, slippery surfaces and submerged hazards.Never use generators, propane heaters, barbecues or charcoal indoors due to carbon monoxide risks.PG&amp;E reminds customers to update their contact information at www.pge.com/mywildfirealerts.

The company's market cap closed above $3 trillion Friday for the first time ever, as shares ended the day up 2.31% at $193.97.The iPhone maker originally eclipsed the $3 trillion mark in Jan. 2022.The milestone comes after a rip-roaring first half of 2023 for tech stocks, which has seen the Nasdaq rise 30% while Apple stock has gained more than 45%.Wall Street and Silicon Valley are all in on the generative AI hype wave that kicked off with the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in Nov. 2022. But while companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA) can point to their work in AI for at least partially buoying their share prices, Apple has largely stayed away from any mention of AI.Instead, the company's biggest achievements have come via its ability to navigate the supply chain crisis caused by COVID lockdowns in China and the resilience of its iPhone business—and the promise of diving into new the AR/VR headset market with its Vision Pro.""This is ultimately a safe haven type of company for investors no matter the macroeconomy you're in,"" CFRA vice president and technology equity analyst Angelo Zino told Yahoo Finance Live ""It's a name we continue to live and a name we continue to tell investors, 'Don't necessarily trade, it's a name you want to be investing in for the long term.'""Apple, like other tech companies, faces difficult comparisons over the last few earnings seasons as it digested the massive pull forward in sales of iPhones, Mac computers, and iPads during the pandemic.And while Mac and iPad revenue in the latest quarter was lower than in the same period of 2022, iPhone sales jumped year-over-year.Market champ: Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during an annoucement of new products on the Apple campus June 5, in Cupertino, Calif.

But iPad sales could still be challenged moving forward.Story continuesThe Cupertino-based company is also moving in a handful of new directions that could define its future. Its most ambitious Vision Pro headset is set to launch in early 2024 at an eye-watering $3,499.But Apple is likely to bring that price down to a more palatable range to ensure the average iPhone owner can afford the headset. That could open up a whole new product category for the company, though reaching the highs of its iPhone business is a tough prospect.Sign up for the Yahoo Finance newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)Perhaps more importantly are Apple's moves into the Indian market.The company opened its first store in the country in April, signaling its commitment to growing its market base in the world's most populous nation. But Apple's products are still prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of Indians, meaning sales growth will likely be slow.Apple is also in the process of moving some of its manufacturing might into India, as it seeks to trim its reliance on China as its main hub for building iPhones and other products.The effort comes as geopolitical tensions between the US and China put Apple in the difficult position of having to placate two rival countries while continuing to operate a successful business.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 85% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$50b in market cap. One-year return to shareholders is currently 60% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Parker-Hannifin. View our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Parker-Hannifin?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Parker-Hannifin does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Parker-Hannifin's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Parker-Hannifin. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.5% and 4.3% of the stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Parker-HannifinThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Parker-Hannifin Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$269m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Parker-Hannifin. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

70,79b91480-bbac-3fb4-9abe-d9dc47b4668a,SYY,2023-07-01,We Think Sysco (NYSE:SYY) Might Have The DNA Of A Multi-Bagger,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-sysco-nyse-syy-might-110014644.html,1688209214,STORY,['SYY'],"[If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Sysco (NYSE:SYY) we really liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Sysco, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.22 = US$3.0b ÷ (US$23b - US$9.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).Thus, Sysco has an ROCE of 22%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 12% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Sysco roceIn the above chart we have measured Sysco's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?Sysco is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 20% over the last five years. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.In Conclusion...To bring it all together, Sysco has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 20% to shareholders. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term.Story continuesIf you want to continue researching Sysco, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.Sysco is not the only stock earning high returns.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Kraft Heinz (KHC) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.76 a share, just 26 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 26, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.76 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.75 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Kraft Heinz has an Earnings ESP of 1%.KHC is just one of a large group of Consumer Staples stocks with a positive ESP figure. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Archer Daniels Midland, which is readying to report earnings on July 25, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.62 a share, and ADM is 25 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Archer Daniels Midland is $1.55, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 3.91%.Story continuesKHC and ADM's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

HST need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19, 2024 $2.80 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Host Hotels’ shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Host Hotels is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry that ranks in the Bottom 32% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, seven analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped the estimate. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 53 cents per share to 56 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Host Hotels right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Goldman's was the largest and Citigroup's was the smallest.Many also touted the results of their regulatory exams, which the Fed released on Wednesday after assessing whether 23 institutions would be able to withstand a severe global recession characterized by 10% unemployment and a 45% stock market plunge.Banks weren't allowed to return any cash to shareholders until they received a passing grade.Morgan Stanley's CEO James Gorman said on Friday that the results ""demonstrate the durability of our transformed business model.""

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Goldman Sachs in FocusBased in New York, Goldman Sachs (GS) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -5.91%. The investment bank is paying out a dividend of $2.5 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.1% compared to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.52% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.66%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $10 is up 11.1% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Goldman Sachs has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 29.89%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Goldman's current payout ratio is 36%, meaning it paid out 36% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for GS for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $31.05 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 3.29%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, GS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It also features a modular and scalable design that can accommodate different sample types and throughput needs.Price PerformanceShares of the company have risen 60.4% year to date compared with the industry’s 6.6% growth. The S&amp;P 500 Index has improved 15% in the same time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdvantages of the Revio SystemThe long-read sequencing system can consolidate multiple tests into a single, comprehensive solution. This eliminates the need for the time-consuming and costly multi-stage vetting process that was formerly required for diagnosing rare diseases and developmental delay disorders.Previously, separate experiments like chromosome analysis, optical genome mapping and short-read exome sequencing were required to diagnose these conditions. However, the Revio system can now provide researchers with all the required data in a single analysis. This way, it gets faster and easier to identify the genetic causes of rare diseases, improving diagnosis and treatment.The system will significantly expand Bioscientia's genomics capabilities that will help offer more comprehensive and accurate testing for monogenic disorders, such as deafness, blindness and developmental delay. It will also help detect the underlying causes of rare diseases.The long-read sequencing system will aid Bioscientia in providing lower overall costs and better insights to families using fewer tests. It will also reduce the time spent in assembling genome maps.Story continuesThe Revio system will also be used by Bioscientia for extended testing of samples that are partially solved and scenarios of recessive diseases. Bioscientia's existing technologies of short-read exome sequencing have not been able to provide complete, definitive explanations for these situations.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global whole genome sequencing market was valued at $1,645.2 million in 2022 and is anticipated to witness a CAGR of approximately 20.1% during 2023-2030. Factors like the growing prevalence of genetic disorders and mutations that lead to cancer progression, and the possibility of identification and diagnosis of targeted diseases are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest tie-up is expected to significantly strengthen PacBio’s global business.Notable DevelopmentsEarlier this month, PacBio announced a clinical research study with Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc) to explore genetic causes of rare and genetic diseases. The study is also expected to explore the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of using PacBio’s HiFi sequencing technology for routine clinical use.PacBio and Radboudumc aim to discover the genetic origins of rare and genetic diseases via collaboration.Last month, PacBio announced its first-quarter 2023 results, wherein there was a robust increase in its overall top line, including strong revenues from Instrument and Consumables. Solid performances in the Asia-Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions were also witnessed.In April, PacBio publicized the availability of its new high-throughput Nanobind DNA Extraction kits. The kits, a key product from the company’s Circulomics acquisition, are based on proprietary Nanobind disks.

""It’s the digital age now and the age of streaming, and it’s a whole different business model. So it really begs that we stand firm and hold strong and do right by the members in this industry and honor the massive contribution that they make. So I’m really in it to win it.""Possible 'double whammy' strikes would have 'long-term effects' Fran Drescher, left, president of SAG-AFTRA, and Meredith Stiehm, president of Writers Guild of America West, pose together during a rally by striking writers outside Paramount Pictures studio, Monday, May 8, 2023, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Drescher, along with the guild's national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, told members in a video posted on Saturday that ongoing talks have been ""extremely productive.""However, later reports suggested that wasn't necessarily the case with more than 1,000 actors including Drescher penning a letter to the guild that said they're ""prepared to strike"" if SAG doesn’t ""get all the way there"" in its talks with studios.""If SAG-AFTRA joins the WGA picket line, audiences should prepare for re-runs and extended delays for their favorite TV shows and movies,"" KPMG’s US National Media Leader Scott Purdy told Yahoo Finance in an email. ""Undoubtedly, this potential double whammy could have long-term effects on the film and television industry. Like the WGA strike, compensation and artificial intelligence are at the heart of this.""Story continues""While the writers are fighting for protections for the intellectual property they produce, the AI component could be just as significant for talent if AI can regenerate their image, likeness, and voice in TV, shows, [and] movies,"" he continued.""Bottom line: The production engine requires both writers and actors. Even if the WGA strike comes to an end, we’ll still be waiting for actors to come back before productions can begin again.""Hollywood actors may join writers on the picket lines.

The movies that are in theaters now were written well before the strike, but eventually that pipeline is going to dry up,"" he told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday.

ULTA has been benefiting from the strength in its skincare category. Omnichannel growth and focus on core priorities have also been working well for this retailer offering cosmetics, fragrance, haircare and skincare products and related services.These upsides have been driving the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company amid high SG&amp;A costs, as witnessed in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein the top and bottom lines increased year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. On its first-quarter earnings call, management stated that while the operating landscape is likely to keep evolving, it remains confident about the resilience of the beauty category.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal-year earnings per share (EPS) has risen by a penny to $25.05 over the past 30 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKey DriversUlta Beauty has been seeing market share gains in major beauty categories for a while now, with skincare standing out, thanks to consumers’ rising interest in self-care and the company’s focus on newness and innovation. The trend continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein skincare was the company’s best-performing category. The company saw double-digit growth in both mass and prestige, mainly due to newness, engaging social media content and solid performance through 21 Days of Beauty and Spring Haul.The company has been focused on its six strategic priorities. The company’s foremost priority is strengthening its omnichannel business and exploring the potential of physical and digital facets. Secondly, the company is undertaking various tools to enhance the experience of guests, like offering a virtual try-on tool and in-store education and reimagining fixtures, among others. Thirdly, the company concentrates on offering customers a curated and exclusive range of beauty products through innovation.Fourthly, the company is focused on deepening customer engagement by boosting rewards and loyalty programs. Fifthly, management is committed to optimizing its cost structure. Sixthly, the company strives to boost organizational talent and strengthen its culture.Ulta Beauty has been enriching its omnichannel experience through launches like Beauty to Go, options like same-day delivery (in some stores) and unique salon services across stores, among others. In fiscal 2022, the company launched its new alliance with Target and has 359 Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shop locations (as of the first quarter of fiscal 2023-end). Apart from this, Ulta Beauty is benefiting from its Wellness Shop launch (in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021), a cross-category platform providing guests self-care for the mind, body and spirit across several stores and online.Story continuesSG&amp;A Costs HighUlta Beauty’s selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses have been rising year over year for a while now. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, SG&amp;A expenses rose 22.2% to $612.1 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses were 23.2%, up from 21.4% reported in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to the deleveraging of store payroll and benefits, corporate overheads and marketing expenses. The operating margin decreased from 18.7% to 16.8%.Management now expects the operating margin to be between 14.5% and 14.8% compared with the previous view of 14.7% and 15%. The revised outlook reflects an increased gross margin deleverage view, which includes the effects of increased shrink and a more competitive and promotional landscape. The company continues to expect SG&amp;A deleverage due to additional expenditures associated with strategic investments and the effects of overall inflation.Wrapping UpThe abovementioned upsides are likely to keep Ulta Beauty well-placed for growth. The company expects fiscal 2023 net sales in the range of $11-$11.1 billion compared with $10.2 billion reported in fiscal 2022. Comparable sales are expected to rise 4-5%. The company expects comp growth in the first half in the high-single-digit range and moderate-to-low-single-digit growth in the second half of the year. For fiscal 2023, earnings are envisioned in the band of $24.70-$25.40 per share, suggesting a rise from the $24.01 per share reported in fiscal 2022.Shares of ULTA have rallied 20.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 23%.Some Promising StocksAbercrombie &amp; Fitch ANF, which operates as a specialty retailer, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

It aimed for 60% of its revenue to come from direct sales to shoppers by 2025.But earlier this month, executives at Macy's and Designer Brands, the parent company of DSW, said they would return to selling Nike shoes or clothing, starting this fall. On Thursday, Nike CEO John Donahoe said its return to wholesale distribution of Nike merchandise is ""a continued evolution"" of its strategy to reach as many shoppers as possible, including through department stores and other chains.Nike's return to other retail outlets could reflect a needed change in its strategy driven by shoppers' return to brick-and-mortar stores, said Brian Yacktman, president of YCG Investments. But Yacktman added the decision raised concerns that Nike was moving back to these retailers in a bid to clear inventory and meet short-term profit objectives.Carolane De Palmas, an analyst at ActivTrades, said Nike's move does help it adapt to evolving consumer preferences. But it also ""may seem desperate or indicate a flaw in their direct-to-consumer strategy,"" she added.Broadly, retailers are cutting back on orders and in some cases lowering their forecasts to reflect shoppers' caution. Macy's and Designer Brands cut forecasts earlier this month, citing a drop in demand and the need to discount in order to get people to stores.A recovery in China helped Nike beat fourth-quarter revenue estimates, though earnings missed forecasts. Thomas Hayes, chairman of hedge fund Great Hill Capital said, ""With China sales blowing past expectations ... this beat is auspicious for future quarters' results.""Story continuesNike shares were down 2.5% Friday.Last month, Adidas said the Chinese market was improving, although its chief executive warned the group still faces a bumpy year.(Reporting by Katherine Masters in New York, Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru)]"

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. NextEra Energy (NEE) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.81 a share 28 days away from its upcoming earnings release on July 28, 2023.NextEra Energy's Earnings ESP sits at 1.47%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.81 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.79.NEE is part of a big group of Utilities stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Consolidated Edison (ED) as well.Slated to report earnings on August 3, 2023, Consolidated Edison holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.95 a share 34 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Consolidated Edison is $0.73, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 29.43%.Story continuesNEE and ED's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

""A jury could find that such conduct is not the behavior of active competitors.""But the judge also narrowed the case to cover alleged ""anomalous decreases in broiler production"" in 2008-2009 and 2011-2012.Durkin dismissed claims relating to supply cuts in 2015-2016 and alleged manipulation of the Georgia Dock broiler price index, saying evidence of a conspiracy was ""weak.""He also dismissed claims against other producers including Perdue, as well as against Agri Stats, whose reports about the industry allegedly let producers monitor each other's production and pricing activities.Pilgrim's Pride, Sanderson and Tyson did not immediately respond to requests for comment after market hours.The companies have previously settled claims with some of the plaintiffs, including $221.5 million of settlements announced by Tyson.Pilgrim's Pride is owned mainly by Brazil's JBS SA.The case is In re Broiler Chicken Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 16-08637.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)]"

The solution has been made available to banks across North America and Europe.Powered by a single API, the Mastercard solution enables consumers to identify and manage their required subscriptions and most importantly, cancels subscriptions that are not required from their bank’s digital apps. The hassles associated with switching between apps while unsubscribing from services are addressed by the solution.In addition to greater control, the recent launch will also enable consumers to take a glance at digital receipts and merchant information, thereby presenting a clear picture of their monthly expenditures and easing the digital financial journey.Apart from being of great use to consumers, the solution will fetch numerous benefits to financial institutions, issuers and merchants as well. The effectiveness of this Mastercard solution is expected to minimize operational expenses for financial institutions while merchants and issuers can get relief from the costs related to disputes and establish strong connections with customers.The latest tie-up with Subaio reflects Mastercard’s sincere efforts to unveil advanced and seamless customer-focused solutions across different parts of the globe. And the well-established subscription management service of Subaio makes it the apt partner to complement MA’s endeavor. In fact, the tech giant extended a helping hand to Subaio by choosing it as a participant in the Mastercard Start Path Program in 2020. Moves similar to the latest one are likely to empower Mastercard in harnessing potential growth prospects of the global subscription economy.  A booming digital era and the emergence of advanced technologies might have triggered the growing inclination of consumers toward utilizing subscription-based products and have led to the current situation wherein they own a significant number of subscriptions.Story continuesIn February 2023, MA rolled out innovative payment solutions backed with the power of Mastercard Payment Gateway Services across Saudi Arabia and empowered the country’s merchants to conduct a diversified array of recurring transactions.  Since recurring payments have to be made at regular intervals, the MA technology-backed solutions automate payments and remove the necessity of payer presence on the website or app.Shares of Mastercard have gained 21.8% in a year compared with the industry’s 8.7% growth.

109,c3eb7d46-6234-3b80-9041-c500afd29d64,MA,2023-07-01,Investors in Mastercard (NYSE:MA) have seen splendid returns of 100% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-mastercard-nyse-ma-seen-130132544.html,1688130092,STORY,['MA'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. To wit, the Mastercard share price has climbed 95% in five years, easily topping the market return of 52% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 24% in the last year , including dividends .So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Mastercard To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Mastercard managed to grow its earnings per share at 20% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Mastercard's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Mastercard's TSR for the last 5 years was 100%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Mastercard shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 24% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 15% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Mastercard better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Mastercard   you should know about.We will like Mastercard better if we see some big insider buys.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of QUALCOMM (NASDAQ:QCOM) we really liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for QUALCOMM, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.31 = US$13b ÷ (US$48b - US$7.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, QUALCOMM has an ROCE of 31%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 13%. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM roceIn the above chart we have measured QUALCOMM's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering QUALCOMM here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?You'd find it hard not to be impressed with the ROCE trend at QUALCOMM. The figures show that over the last five years, returns on capital have grown by 226%. That's not bad because this tells for every dollar invested (capital employed), the company is increasing the amount earned from that dollar. Interestingly, the business may be becoming more efficient because it's applying 21% less capital than it was five years ago. QUALCOMM may be selling some assets so it's worth investigating if the business has plans for future investments to increase returns further still.Story continuesThe Bottom LineFrom what we've seen above, QUALCOMM has managed to increase it's returns on capital all the while reducing it's capital base. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if QUALCOMM can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.One final note, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with QUALCOMM (including 1 which is concerning) .If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.23%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.84%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.24%.Coming into today, shares of the chipmaker had gained 1.93% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 3.32%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.67%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Qualcomm as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Qualcomm is projected to report earnings of $1.81 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 38.85%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $8.51 billion, down 22.15% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $8.25 per share and revenue of $35.9 billion. These totals would mark changes of -34.16% and -18.77%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Qualcomm should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.14% lower. Qualcomm currently has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell).Investors should also note Qualcomm's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 14.3. This represents a no noticeable deviation compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.3.Story continuesMeanwhile, QCOM's PEG ratio is currently 0.92. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Wireless Equipment was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.8 at yesterday's closing price.The Wireless Equipment industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 112, putting it in the top 45% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

113,c4ccab50-c2df-39e7-a6cc-b54e60a1ce62,QCOM,2023-07-01,Qualcomm (QCOM) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-qcom-considered-good-investment-133006839.html,1688131806,STORY,['QCOM'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Qualcomm (QCOM).Qualcomm currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.69, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 21 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.69 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 21 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 14 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 4.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for QCOMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for QCOMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Qualcomm here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Qualcomm, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date.

The award has been provided by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, OH.Details of the DealValued at $23 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Jun 30, 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will offer contractor engineering and technical services to support the F-16 aircraft program.This contract also entails provision for on-site proficiency training and advice to elevate the technical skills and abilities of personnel responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Aeronautics unit’s equipment to the level of self-sufficiency.Work related to this deal will be carried out in Hill Air Force Base, UT. The contract involves Foreign Military Sales to Bahrain, Chile, Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Taiwan, Thailand and Turkey.Importance of F-16 JetsOver the past decade, a rapid rise in global terrorism and adverse geopolitical situations across borders have boosted the demand for defense products. Combat aircraft constitute a major portion of this portfolio.It is imperative to mention here that the F-16 Falcon jets have significantly risen in importance on a global scale over the past few years.The F-16 has witnessed a significant development in the last couple of years, with nations like Taiwan, Bulgaria, Morocco and Bahrain signing agreements to procure new F-16 aircraft.In order to make the most of this rising demand, Lockheed introduced F-16 Block 70/72 in 2020, the most advanced F-16 aircraft, combining numerous capabilities and structural upgrades. This model provides a new aircraft structure that lasts 50% longer than the previous F-16 version. Such advancements might have been ushering in contracts from Pentagon and other U.S. allies, like the latest one, thereby boosting Lockheed’s revenue prospects.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals.Story continuesMeanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest weapons exporter worldwide, the nation has been spending significantly on defense products, including combat aircraft.Lockheed, being a prominent combat aircraft manufacturer in the United States, enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fighter aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.72% during 2023-2028, with North America constituting the largest share of this market.Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities, and increased spending on defense.

This segment's primary products include military aircraft like F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15, P-8, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk aircraft.BA has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%.

This helps warfighters in accomplishing missions anytime, anywhere and under any condition.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%.

117,b621eeb4-2b40-3371-b22b-4c70699e92bd,PHM,2023-07-01,3 Stocks to Buy Amid Higher Borrowing Cost,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-buy-amid-higher-120700321.html,1688126820,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'NVDA', 'PHM']","[Borrowing cost in the United States is currently at a 16-year high. This is due to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hike to tame the four-decade-high inflation. After 10 consecutive interest rate hikes, the Fed took a pause in its June meeting as the inflation rate was on a downward trajectory.Fed controls the overnight interest rate, which banks and credit unions apply to borrow and lend to each other. By increasing interest rates, the Fed expects to cool off demand by making borrowing of money more expensive. This will help Fed to put a check on inflation. Currently, the interest rate is in the range of 5.00-5.25%. The Fed chairman has hinted at another half a percentage rate hike this year based on the inflation rate to meet its long-term goal of 2%.Companies with high debt exposure are mostly impacted by the high-interest-rate regime. High-interest rates increase the cost of borrowing. Due to a higher interest payout, profitability would also take a hit, which in turn would affect the stock prices in the near term.Thus, investors with a conservative point of view can invest in companies with low-debt equity ratio as they provide protection from bankruptcy and a higher return on equity during adverse economic situations. Companies with low-debt equity ratios can exercise more control over their finances as they have negligible exposure to interest rate risks. The financial metric provide an overall view of how much the company is relying on debt to finance its operations. The debt-equity ratio varies from industry to industry. Also, investors can consider viewing long-term debt over total liability as it carries more risk over the short term.On that note, let us look at companies like NVIDIA NVDA, PulteGroup PHM and Salesforce CRM that have a very low debt-equity ratio within the range of 0-0.5 and have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index.NVIDIA is headquartered in Santa Clara, CA.

124,241ecc5a-93a4-363e-bd97-8820a58249db,MOS,2023-07-01,Wingstop and The Mosaic Company have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wingstop-mosaic-company-highlighted-zacks-123800034.html,1688128680,STORY,"['WING', 'MOS', 'OMC', 'IPG', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – June 30, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Wingstop WING as the Bull of the Day and The Mosaic Company MOS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Interpublic Group IPG and Omnicom Group OMC.Here is a synopsis of all four stocks.Bull of the Day:Headquartered in Texas, Wingstop offers cooked-to-order, hand-sauced, tossed chicken wings, and other similar food items. Currently, the stock sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with earnings expectations increasing across the board.Aside from the improved earnings outlook, let’s look at several other aspects of WING shares.Current StandingWING is a solid consideration for any growth-focused investor; estimates for its current fiscal year (FY23) reflect 15% earnings growth on 20% higher revenues. Peering ahead to FY24, earnings and revenue are forecasted to witness growth of 16% and 14%, respectively.Wingstop carries a Style Score of “A” for Growth.Still, the stock may not entice those focusing on value, with the present 14.1X forward price-to-sales sitting on the high end of the spectrum. Still, investors have had little issue forking up the premium given the company’s growth, with WING shares up 40% year-to-date and crushing the S&amp;P 500’s impressive 16% gain.The stock carries a Style Score of “F” for Value.It’s worth watching for the company’s next quarterly release expected on July 27th; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.50 suggests an 11% improvement in earnings from the year-ago period. Analysts have been bullish, with the quarterly estimate being revised 11% higher since April of this year.In addition, our consensus revenue estimate for the upcoming quarter to be reported stands at $104.3 million, 25% higher than the year-ago quarter. The quarterly sales estimate has also enjoyed positive revisions, up 4% since April.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.Additionally, the top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.Wingstop would be an excellent stock for investors to keep on their watchlists, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bear of the Day:The Mosaic Company is a leading producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash for the global agriculture industry. The company is the biggest integrated phosphate producer globally and among the four largest potash producers worldwide.Analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company’s earnings outlook, pushing the stock into an unfavorable Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Let’s take a closer look at the company.Current StandingThe company posted mixed results in its latest quarterly release, falling short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by nearly 11%. In fact, Mosaic has struggled to exceed earnings expectations consistently, carrying a -10.8% average EPS surprise over its last four quarters.Still, revenue results have been more positive, with MOS exceeding sales estimates in back-to-back quarters.The company’s growth is expected to taper off, with estimates indicating a 60% pullback in earnings on 30% lower revenues for its current fiscal year (FY23). And in FY24, projections allude to a further 20% decline in the bottom line on 13% lower sales.Analysts have been bearish for some time now, with the $4.49 per share estimate being revised more than 60% lower since June of 2022.Shares do pay a solid dividend, currently yielding 2.4% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 10% of the company's earnings. Dividend growth is also there, with the company sporting a sizable 53% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Bottom LineNegative earnings estimate revisions from analysts and weak quarterly results paint a challenging picture for the company’s shares in the near term.The Mosaic Company is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company’s earnings outlook.For those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.Additional content:2 Dividend-Paying Stocks to Benefit from the Advertising MarketThe Zacks advertising and marketing industry is currently in good shape. The upside was backed by the advertising revenue trend in the United States. Per Statista, advertising revenues increased from $194.7 billion in 2014 to $343.5 billion in 2022, delivering a constant growth except 2020 when the industry took a hit due to the pandemic.We believe this is the appropriate time to invest in a booming market and pick regular dividend-paying stocks. Dividends create a reliable source of return without selling shares.Industry and Its TrendsPer Statista, advertising revenues are expected to reach $424.3 billion by 2027. Internet advertising has been gradually replacing traditional TV advertising, contributing nearly 63% to advertisement revenues in 2022. The metric is expected to be 68% by 2027. Online advertising revenues have seen a surge in the past five years, growing 130% to nearly $210 billion in 2022. The inclusion of artificial intelligence is adding to the growth of online advertising. Paid search, podcasts and videos are some of the main avenues of digital ad spend.In the past year, the advertising and marketing industry has rallied 24.2% compared with the S&amp;P 500 composites’ 14.6% increase and the Business Services sector’s 3.6% rise.Why Dividends?In case of market volatility, dividend stocks can be a go to option for investors. With the volatility currently involved in U.S. markets, investing in fundamentally strong stocks with a good track record of dividend payment seems to be the best idea. Dividend-paying companies are likely to recover faster after a major correction in the market compared with its non-dividend-paying peers.Stock PicksStocks from the expanding advertising and marketing industry that pay regular dividends and exhibit fundamental strength include Interpublic Group and Omnicom Group. They belong to the broader Business Services sector and currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.To select dividend paying stocks, we ran the Zacks Stocks Screener to identify the above-mentioned stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a five-year historical dividend growth of more than 0.1%. These stocks have a dividend payout ratio of less than 60%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Interpublic Group’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $2.96, indicating a 7.6% year-over-year growth.

The award has been provided by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, OH.Details of the DealValued at $23 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Jun 30, 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will offer contractor engineering and technical services to support the F-16 aircraft program.This contract also entails provision for on-site proficiency training and advice to elevate the technical skills and abilities of personnel responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Aeronautics unit’s equipment to the level of self-sufficiency.Work related to this deal will be carried out in Hill Air Force Base, UT. The contract involves Foreign Military Sales to Bahrain, Chile, Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Taiwan, Thailand and Turkey.Importance of F-16 JetsOver the past decade, a rapid rise in global terrorism and adverse geopolitical situations across borders have boosted the demand for defense products. Combat aircraft constitute a major portion of this portfolio.It is imperative to mention here that the F-16 Falcon jets have significantly risen in importance on a global scale over the past few years.The F-16 has witnessed a significant development in the last couple of years, with nations like Taiwan, Bulgaria, Morocco and Bahrain signing agreements to procure new F-16 aircraft.In order to make the most of this rising demand, Lockheed introduced F-16 Block 70/72 in 2020, the most advanced F-16 aircraft, combining numerous capabilities and structural upgrades. This model provides a new aircraft structure that lasts 50% longer than the previous F-16 version. Such advancements might have been ushering in contracts from Pentagon and other U.S. allies, like the latest one, thereby boosting Lockheed’s revenue prospects.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals.Story continuesMeanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest weapons exporter worldwide, the nation has been spending significantly on defense products, including combat aircraft.Lockheed, being a prominent combat aircraft manufacturer in the United States, enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fighter aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.72% during 2023-2028, with North America constituting the largest share of this market.Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities, and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Lockheed, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Boeing BA, Northrop Grumman NOC and Textron TXT.Boeing’s Defense, Space &amp; Security segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft.

Sales did rise 5% from the prior-year quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOverall, Nike’s total sales were up 10% in fiscal 2023 to $51.22 billion but annual earnings declined -14% at $3.23 per share compared to EPS of $3.75 in FY22.Still, CEO John Donahoe was high on the company’s FY23 stating it was a milestone year for Nike as their unique advantages continue to drive competitive separation.Earnings Outlook When compared to its main competitor Adidas (ADDYY), Nike’s outlook does project the competitive separation CEO John Donahoe alluded to in the company’s Q4 report.Based on Zacks estimates, Nike’s current fiscal 2024 earnings are forecasted to rebound and jump 20% at $3.87 per share. More impressive, FY25 earnings are projected to climb another 20% at $4.64 a share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis easily trumps Adidas’ EPS growth as the company continues to deal with inventory headwinds surrounding the previous fallout with its partner and collaborator Kanye West.To that point, Adidas earnings are now projected at an adjusted loss of -$1.49 per share in FY23 compared to EPS of $0.66 in 2022. However, Adidas’ fiscal 2024 earnings are also expected to rebound and soar to $2.10 per share although this is less daunting than Nike’s bottom line.  Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineLike its rival Adidas, Nike stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. There could still be better buying opportunities ahead but holding Nike stock could be rewarding as the company adjusts to higher product input costs and logistic headwinds subside.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They come in handy for patients who can't pay a medical bill all up frontBut the lawmakers, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, say the cards' deferred interest features are confusing and often lead to consumers paying high interest rates after an initial promotional period has ended. They also say that sometime the cards are used in lieu of need-based programs that hospitals and other health organizations should apply to a patient’s finances before forcing them to take on debt.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which oversees consumer financial markets, previously highlighted these issues in a report issued in May. The bureau has not taken any action since the report came out, but groups of consumer advocates are pushing for the agency to consider writing new regulations for medical credit cards.“Our investigation shows that medical credit cards can pose a significant threat to patient’s finances. We urge CFPB to take action to curb these harms,” wrote Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, to the bureau. Warren’s letter was signed also by Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont, and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass.CareCredit has existed for decades as a popular way for patients to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses at doctors or dentist offices. Americans spent $3.7 billion on CareCredit in the first three months of 2023, according to Synchrony Bank, the parent company of CareCredit. Americans have roughly $12 billion in outstanding loans with CareCredit.Wells Fargo also has a medical credit card under the name Wells Fargo Health Advantage.Story continuesBut what used to be a product just for elective medical procedures has slowly evolved into a credit card accepted at major doctors offices and hospitals.CareCredit has long offered to customers a deferred interest promotional feature, which means a patient would pay no interest on a purchase if paid off within a certain period of time, usually 12 months. But if a patient failed to pay off that charge within the time limit, the interest that's accumulated over the last year can be billed all at once to the customer.The Senators note that roughly one out of four CareCredit customers end up paying interest on their purchase, while one out of five Wells Fargo customers pay interest.“The CFPB must take immediate action to protect patients from these shady practices, starting with putting an end to deferred interest for medical credit cards,” Warren said to The Associated Press.The senators raise a concern that has been echoed by consumer advocates that CareCredit and Wells Fargo's expansion into traditional doctors offices could potentially be problematic, as hospital billing and insurance is never a straightforward process and often what a patient is billed is not what a patient will pay in the end. The Senators are concerned patients could be charging these cards before the hospital bill is settled.The Senators ask the CFPB to potentially look for ways to make sure medical credit cards are used only after insurance and need-based aid is exhausted without violating a patient's medical privacy rights.“We are also concerned by the prevalence of medical billing errors, which may put patients on the hook for charges they do not owe,” the Senators write.In a statement, Synchrony Bank said it looks forward to working with the bureau and with Congress on how medical credit cards are accepted and used.“Protecting consumers is of paramount importance and we are committed to continue to educate all stakeholders about the fair and transparent way we offer our products,"" the bank said.]"

""The drug companies' incentive (is) to try to block this thing in any way they can and to keep charging American taxpayers and seniors on Medicare these exorbitant prices.""The industry has also threatened the negotiations would disincentivize innovation in the industry and lock Medicare enrollees out of access to live saving drugs.Story continuesIn the revised guidance Friday, the agency said it would share more information and is willing to make the process more transparent.U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during an event to discuss Social Security and Medicare held at the University of Tampa on February 09, 2023 in Tampa, Florida. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)""CMS will not publicly discuss ongoing negotiations prior to the release of the explanation of the maximum fair price (MFP) unless a (drug maker) publicly discloses information regarding the negotiation process. In addition, CMS will treat as proprietary certain data submitted by a (drug maker)"" unless the manufacturer chooses to go public with the data first, the guidance said.PhRMA said in a statement that the changes don't go far enough.""While we appreciate CMS recognizing it went well beyond legal limits and rescinding the proposed 'gag clause' in the final guidance, CMS will continue to limit opportunities for manufacturers to raise issues of concern and provide feedback,"" it said.""We received more than 7,000 thoughtful and constructive public comments on the initial guidance,"" Brooks-LaSure said. ""We considered every bit of feedback to ensure our rules of the road for the Medicare negotiations are focused on the people we serve.""Medicare director Dr. Meena Seshaman also clarified during a call with reporters that the sharing of information includes that which is shared among manufacturers, and that any shared information should also be done in line with rules for anti-competitive practices.The focus, she said, is on fulfilling the intent of the Congress in passing the law to help lower drug costs.At the same time, a number of companies are losing exclusivity for blockbuster drugs, likely stoking increased competition as generics and biosimilars come to market. AbbVie (ABBV) lost exclusivity on its blockbuster Humira this year and already has biosimilar competition, while Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ) Stelara will lose its patent this fall.""The negotiation process is for those drugs that do not have meaningful competition, and where there is meaningful competition then those drugs would no longer be selected,"" Seshamani said.""The program involves no genuine 'negotiation' at all. Instead, it compels pharmaceutical manufacturers to accept prices that are capped at whatever price HHS chooses, while setting no meaningful constraints on HHS’s new price-setting powers,"" according to the lawsuit filed by PhRMA.Other changes include parameters for choosing drugs and an emphasis on the fact that manufacturers can opt out of the process, but will face a hefty tax — another element of the bill called unconstitutional in the lawsuits.""The Drug Pricing Program then forces manufacturers to deliver a government-approved message, compelling them to 'agree' to the government-dictated price...under threat of a crippling excise tax for nonacquiescence. The 'tax' itself is staggering, reaching as high as 1,900% of a manufacturer’s total U.S. revenues for a drug,"" the lawsuit said.Seshamani said Friday that the agency has had an open door and proactively reached out with meetings with all stakeholders. ""We want to implement this law in the most thoughtful way possible and we will continue to implement in this fashion,"" Seshamani said.AARP's director of health care costs and access, Leigh Purvis, told Yahoo Finance Friday that CMS does seem to be fighting for patients, but is wary of criticism it is getting.""They are being responsive. I think to the extent that we're seeing criticism, I do think that what we're seeing, at least today, is an indication that they hear that as well. And so I think they're doing a good job of trying to bring everyone to the table,"" Purvis said.CMS looks to still be on track to publish the first 10 drugs selected for negotiated prices in September.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The gene therapy was granted conditional approval in the European Union for adults last August.Multiple reports suggest that BioMarin will price Roctavian at $2.9 million.The FDA approval is based on three-year follow-up safety and efficacy data from the phase III GENEr8-1 study, which evaluated Roctavian in adults aged 18 through 70 with severe hemophilia A. Study participants, who were administered the gene therapy, experienced a mean annualized bleeding rate (“ABR”) reduction of 52% compared with those who were administered the current standard-of-care (“SOC”) of treatment, i.e., a prophylaxis regimen with Factor VIII (“FVIII”).In the year so far, BioMarin’s shares have lost 14.1% compared with the industry’s 9.8% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA rare genetic blood disorder, hemophilia B is caused by a missing or defective clotting protein FVIII, which prevents normal blood clotting. If the blood does not clot properly, it can lead to painful bleeding inside the joints that can cause scarring and damage.Roctavian has been designed to deliver a functional gene that enables the body to produce the FVIII protein on its own, reducing the need for ongoing prophylaxis.Similar to Roctavian, Pfizer PFE and partner Sangamo Therapeutics SGMO are developing their own gene therapy — giroctocogene fitelparvovec — to treat hemophilia A. Sangamo and Pfizer are evaluating giroctocogene fitelparvovec in the phase III AFFINE study. Pfizer/Sangamo expects to report pivotal data from the AFFINE study by mid-2024.

The judge accepted the filing and closed the case.Although the notice did not reference the terms of the settlement, Grossberg's attorney, Parisis G. Filippatos, said in an interview that his client will receive $12 million.In a statement, Fox News said: ""We are pleased that we have been able to resolve this matter without further litigation.”Grossberg said in a statement that while she stands by claims she made in her Manhattan lawsuit and another lawsuit in the Delaware State Superior Court, she was “heartened that Fox News has taken me and my legal claims seriously. I am hopeful, based on our discussions with Fox News today, that this resolution represents a positive step by the Network regarding its treatment of women and minorities in the workplace.”The Manhattan lawsuit claimed that Fox's legal team “coerced, intimidated, and misinformed"" Grossberg during preparations for her testimony in a legal battle between the network and Dominion, an elections technology company.She maintained in the lawsuit that she had received “damaging and woefully inferior and inadequate legal representation"" compared to male counterparts at Fox News and that the experience had resulted in “irretrievable reputational and emotional harm.”In April, just before opening statements were to begin at trial, Fox agreed to pay more than $787 million to settle the lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems over the network’s airing of false claims following the 2020 presidential election. The settlement was reached shortly before Carlson was expected to be called to testify.Story continuesLess than a week later, on April 24, Carlson, the network’s most popular personality, was fired. Grossberg had worked as “Head of Booking” for Carlson from Sept. 5 until March.In her federal lawsuit, Grossberg asserted that Carlson's show had a cruel and misogynistic workplace, and that she had been pressured to give misleading testimony during a pretrial deposition in the Dominion case.As Grossberg noted in the lawsuit, Dominion had quoted from her deposition in one of its pretrial court filings to support its position that Fox News hosts, producers and executives knew statements about the 2020 election being “stolen” from President Donald Trump were false or recklessly disregarded the truth.The lawsuit said Dominion directly cited Grossberg’s answer when she was posed the question: “If someone says something untrue on one of your shows, do you think it’s important to correct it?”“No,” she answered.Her lawsuit said: “This was not the testimony Ms. Grossberg wanted to give but she had been conditioned and felt coerced to give this response that simultaneously painted her in a negative light as a professional.”According to her lawsuit, she requested a copy of her deposition transcript after her deposition and expressed concern that her testimony was not fully accurate because of the intimidating and confusing coaching she'd received. But lawyers at Fox News withheld the transcript.When prominent media outlets called her journalism and professional ethnics into question based on excerpts of her deposition included in Dominion's pretrial arguments, Grossberg began to experience severe anxiety and stress because of the public distribution of her uncorrected transcript, the lawsuit said.]"

She had worked for Fox since 2019.In firing her, Fox said her legal claims were ""riddled with false allegations against Fox and our employees.""In seeking unspecified monetary damages, Grossberg claimed to have been subjected to a hostile and discriminatory work environment. She accused Fox among other things of gender and religious discrimination as well as pay equity violations.She had also sought unspecified damages in a similar lawsuit in Delaware Superior Court, which she dismissed in May.Grossberg said that during preparation with Fox lawyers for her September 2022 deposition in the Dominion lawsuit, she felt “coerced and intimidated into not saying anything that would make her become Dominion’s ‘star’ witness.”Story continuesDominion had sued Fox seeking $1.6 billion for promoting false vote-rigging claims involving the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Had the Dominion case gone to trial, Grossberg could have been a key witness.Grossberg said Fox subjected her to sexism, misogyny and antisemitism.Carlson was among the defendants in Grossberg's Manhattan lawsuit. The program on which Grossberg worked, ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" was the top-rated prime-time U.S. cable TV news show.Grossberg claimed that Carlson made derogatory comments toward women, and cited incidents such as Carlson's staff discussing whether Michigan's Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, was ""hotter"" and better at sex than Republican opponent Tudor Dixon.Grossberg alleged that on her first day on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" she discovered many photographs of octogenarian then-House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi shown in a plunging bathing suit, revealing the Democrat's cleavage, on her computer and elsewhere throughout the office.She also alleged that a member of Carlson's staff called Grossberg into his office and asked her whether Maria Bartiromo, whom she had worked for before Carlson, was having sex with Republican Representative Kevin McCarthy, now the U.S. House speaker.Grossberg alleged that an executive for Carlson's show once remarked that the ""mother's room,"" an office designated for network employees to pump breast milk, was a ""waste of space"" and should be replaced with a ""room of tanning beds for the guys to tan their testicles.""

GM declined to comment on the ruling.Design patents protect novel visual characteristics of manufactured objects. LKQ asked a U.S. Patent Office tribunal last year to cancel a GM design patent covering a front vehicle fender after their licensing agreement expired and GM threatened to sue LKQ partners for infringement.LKQ told the Patent Trial and Appeal Board that the patent was invalid based on two preexisting publications -- an earlier design patent and a brochure that disclosed a similar design on a 2010 Hyundai Tucson.Story continuesThe board ruled for GM on grounds including that the earlier patent was not independently similar enough to the GM design to be a ""primary reference"" that could justify declaring the GM patent obvious.

164,cd612e09-5112-3680-8bb0-958ba42c3ec9,GM,2023-07-01,A Look at Tesla's Growing Dominance,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-teslas-growing-dominance-192053849.html,1688152853,STORY,"['TSLA', 'F', 'GM']","[In the race toward an electrified future, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has consistently been at the forefront, leading and revolutionizing the electric vehicle industry.Despite macroeconomic challenges and skeptics, Tesla's progressive performance, strong core technology and strategic moves have solidified its prospects. From the considerable success of the Model Y to advancements in full self-driving technology, the company is forming a bullish outlook that can be sustainable.Operational and financial assessmentWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with T. Click here to check it out. TSLA 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of TSLAPeter Lynch Chart of TSLATesla's first-quarter results show considerable progress in the face of production and delivery challenges. The company's strategic focus on higher volumes and a larger fleet, prioritizing growth and market share over immediate profitability, yielded positive results. Not surprisingly, Tesla's operating margin, even after price reductions, remains among the industry's best, demonstrating its ability to control costs and maintain profitability.Additionally, the Model Y's lead as the best-selling vehicle in Europe and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the U.S. highlights Tesla's growing dominance in the EV market. The highly anticipated Cybertruck is progressing well, with Alpha versions being tested and volume production line installation nearing completion at its gigafactory in Texas. The company's expectation of substantial demand for the Cybertruck underscores its ability to generate consumer excitement and anticipation.A Look at Tesla's Growing DominanceSource: Tesla's quarterly updateFurther, the company's energy storage deployment has reached new heights, with nearly four-gigawatt hours deployed in the first quarter. The mega factory in Lathrop, California is driving this growth, and the announcement of a new mega factory in Shanghai further emphasizes Tesla's confidence in the potential of stationary storage to surpass automotive in terms of total gigawatt hours deployed. The mid-20% range of margins projected for the storage business aligns with the company's objective for steady profitability in this segment.Story continuesLooking ahead, Tesla faces various uncertainties and challenges. The macroeconomic environment, including interest rates and economic uncertainty, can impact sales and affordability. The volatility of EV-related commodity prices adds another layer of unpredictability. However, the company remains optimistic about its ability to control costs, optimize production and navigate these challenges effectively.Tesla's forward-oriented strategy emphasizes maximizing production volume, expanding the charging network to accommodate all EVs and pursuing revenue potential through autonomy. The company's focus on prioritizing growth and investment over short-term profitability reflects its confidence in its unique strategic advantage.Trends in productionThe trend of increasing vehicle production capacity bodes well for Tesla. In the first quarter, the company achieved record vehicle production, driven by the ongoing ramp-ups at its factories in Austin, Texas and Berlin. This highlights the company's ability to scale its operations and meet growing demand. By reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month and smoothing deliveries throughout the quarter, Tesla aims to decrease the cost per vehicle while increasing in-transit inventory. This strategy improves operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.Moreover, the successful 4680 cell production and the continued improvement in production rates reflect Tesla's commitment to innovation and technological advancement. Additionally, the progress in equipment installation for Cybertruck production at Gigafactory Texas shows the company's focus on expanding its product lineup to cater to different market segments.Further, China has been an essential market for Tesla, with its Shanghai factory running at near-full capacity for several months. Although there may not be a significant increase in the weekly production run rate, sales expansion into new markets like Thailand, supplied out of Shanghai, demonstrates its ability to tap into new customer bases and achieve positive market reception. Furthermore, Giga Shanghai is Tesla's primary export hub, supporting global distribution.Last but not least, Germany's Model Y production line produced over 5,000 vehicles in a week towards the end of the quarter. The Berlin-Brandenburg factory positions Tesla to better serve the European market and leverage the region's strong demand for EVs.Progress in core technologyTesla's fundamental strength is its core technology, including autopilot and full sell-driving vehicle software, battery, powertrain, manufacturing, energy storage, solar and services.The company is making significant in achieving full autonomy, leveraging the importance of data and neural net training capabilities. Tesla's progress is evident in its FSD beta program, which has amassed over 150 million miles of data collection, providing valuable insights for developing scalable autonomy. This extensive dataset sets Tesla apart from its competitors and reinforces its artificial intelligence-based approach to self-driving technology.A Look at Tesla's Growing DominanceSource: Tesla's quarterly updateAdditionally, Tesla's vehicles stand out due to their seamless software and hardware integration. The software is considered best-in-class across all models, offering features like vehicle controls, safety, security measures (such as sentry mode and dog mode), connectivity and entertainment options. Ongoing software updates continually enhance functionality and the user experience.Further, the company's focus on batteries, powertrains and manufacturing is crucial for sustainable profitability. Tesla's commitment to reducing costs and improving efficiency has led to adopting a 48-volt architecture for vehicle electronics, in-house-designed controllers, cheaper and more scalable drive units and advancements in manufacturing processes. These innovations drive down costs and enable the company to deliver EVs at affordable prices.Notably, the energy storage division has experienced significant growth, with a 360% year-over-year increase in deployments in the first quarter. The ongoing ramp-up of the megafactory and the planned construction of additional facilities demonstrate Tesla's commitment to meeting the growing demand for energy storage solutions. Tesla's focus on cell design, anode, cathode materials, the structural pack concept, the cell factory and cost reduction signifies the company's lead in advancing battery technology. The Texas 4680 factory's expected lower capital expenditure per gigawatt hour and the ongoing production of first- and second-generation tablet cells indicate positive cost reduction and scalability strides.While solar deployments saw a sequential quarterly decline due to volatile weather and supply chain challenges, the 40% year-over-year growth highlights Tesla's potential in the solar industry. As these challenges are addressed and the industry recovers, Tesla's solar division can regain momentum and contribute to long-term growth.Finally, services and other revenue streams, including used vehicle sales and the Supercharging network, reached all-time highs. Tesla's ability to generate substantial revenue and gross profit in these areas diversifies its income streams and ensures continued support for its financial performance.Ads can be a favorable additionTesla's venture into advertising, specifically through Google Ads campaigns in the U.S. and U.K., has several potential long-term benefits for the company.First, advertising allows Tesla to reach a global customer base and raise brand awareness. Despite becoming the most significant EV maker globally, Tesla has relied mainly on non-traditional methods, such as word of mouth and referral programs, for its growth. Using advertising, Tesla can target potential customers through increased visibility, leading to higher sales volumes and market penetration, especially as it expands into new markets.Advertising can also support Tesla in countering false narratives and promoting accurate information. In recent years, the company has had to deal with various misconceptions and negative publicity. Through advertising, it can directly address these misconceptions and accurately communicate the features of its products and services. It will help the company to take control of its narrative and foster favorable public perception, thereby preserving its revenue from any potential damage.Additionally, advertising can support Tesla's sustainability and renewable energy adoption goals. Through solar systems advertisements, Tesla can encourage customers to consider the benefits of powering their homes with renewable sources. This aligns with the company's overall mission of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy.Critically, the adoption of advertising signifies Tesla's willingness to adapt and evolve its strategies. Elon Musk's previous opposition to traditional advertising indicates the company's confidence in its products' value. However, opting for advertising now puts Tesla's responsiveness towards investor demands and focus on exploring new avenues for growth in focus. The flexibility and openness to change may enhance investors' confidence in Tesla.DownsideThe primary fundamental risk to Tesla is the formation of cyclicality in performance metrics, especially revenue growth, which is currently declining. It adversely impacts operating cash flow and net income, while vehicle deliveries increase steadily. Suppose cyclical formation becomes static for Tesla. In that case, it will lead to limited upside potential in its market valuation over the long term, similar to legacy automakers like Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).A Look at Tesla's Growing DominanceSource: Tesla's quarterly updateTakeawayIn conclusion, Tesla's progressive performance, market dominance, FSD progress, core technology advancements and strategic advertising efforts all contribute to a bullish outlook. Despite the challenges, its strong fundamentals, increased production capacity and expanding presence in key international markets lay a solid foundation for future growth.With a focus on innovation, sustainability and strategic adaptability, Tesla is well-positioned to capitalize on its unique advantages in the EV and energy markets. While emerging cyclicality is a threat, the company's focus on long-term revenue potential through autonomy and ongoing technological advancements breeds confidence in its prospects for sustained value growth.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

That figure does not include flights on United Express.United has canceled nearly 3,000 flights this week, with the largest number at its Newark Liberty International Airport hub in New Jersey, which was hit by thunderstorms for much of the week.Kirby blamed disruptions in Newark last weekend on a shortage of Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers. He said in a note to employees “that the FAA frankly failed us” by reducing the rate at which planes could arrive and depart the airport, where United is the dominant carrier.Canceled flights left United planes and crews out of position, hobbling the airline when bad weather hit on Sunday, Kirby said.As United continued to struggle throughout this week, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whose department includes the FAA, said on Twitter that airlines had recovered from the storms “with the exception of United.” He drove home the point by including a bar graph that compared United’s cancellation rate with the rest of the industry.United's operation has improved since midweek.

176,a4ac6971-c63b-3ea0-bdb5-b5698f2d9f60,UAL,2023-07-01,UPDATE 1-Fresh flight disruptions threaten US Fourth of July holiday weekend travel,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-fresh-flight-disruptions-threaten-134355975.html,1688132635,STORY,['UAL'],"[(Adds Thursday TSA passenger figures in paragraph 5, updates total cancellations and delays in paragraph 7 and canceled United flights in paragraph 9)By Doyinsola Oladipo and Rajesh Kumar SinghNEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - The number of people traveling by air in the United States for the Fourth of July holiday is expected to surpass pre-COVID levels for the first time in four years, but recent flight disruptions raise fresh questions about airlines' readiness to handle the summer travel rush.In anticipation of a busy summer, U.S. airlines have taken measures like trimming schedules and beefing up staffing to prevent large-scale flight disruptions, though inclement weather in some regions presents a risk to travelers during the period.Despite signs of slowing consumer spending, about 51 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more from home between Friday, June 30 and Tuesday, July 4, according to travel group AAA. This is about a 4% increase from 2019 levels, the current record year for July 4th travel.The AAA estimates do not include Thursday, June 29, which the Federal Aviation Administration expects to be the busiest day of air travel during the holiday weekend.The U.S. Transportation Security Administration said it screened 2.7 million passengers on Thursday, up 32% from 2019.Last weekend, thunderstorms and failing equipment at an FAA facility in the Washington area created significant delays for air travelers on the U.S. East Coast.About 43,000 flights were delayed and over 7,700 were canceled between Saturday, June 24, and Thursday, June 29, according to flight tracking service FlightAware.United Airlines bore the brunt of the disruptions, with about 19% of its scheduled flights canceled and about 47% delayed.The Chicago-based carrier said its operations were beginning to see improvement. While the cancellations on Thursday were fewer than those in previous days in the week, United still scrapped 18% of its flights, data from FlightAware showed.Story continuesThe disruptions have left passengers fuming, with many United customers venting frustration on social media about long lines, delays in rebooking flights and misplaced luggage.The carrier has been apologizing to customers on Twitter for delays in responding to complaints, citing high call volumes.""It's all-hands-on-deck as our pilots get aircraft moving, contact center teams work overtime to take care of our customers, and our airport customer service staff works tirelessly to deliver bags and board flights,"" United said in a statement.U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has called the summer travel season a ""stress test"" for airline operations.""Nobody can control the weather, but it is important for airlines to create enough cushion in resilience in the system,"" Buttigieg told CNN.United CEO Scott Kirby, however, has blamed the Federal Aviation Administration for making the situation worse. In a staff memo, he said over 150,000 United customers were affected last weekend because of FAA staffing issues and its impact on managing traffic.Still, the airline has said it would be ""on track"" to restore operations for the holiday weekend when it expects 5 million people to fly with it. Its bookings are up about 12% from last year and have nearly rebounded to pre-pandemic levels.American Airlines expects nearly 3 million customers from Friday, June 30, through Tuesday, July 4, across more than 26,000 scheduled flights.Travel spending has held up nationwide, and air carriers expect strong results through 2023, which comes against a backdrop of U.S. consumer confidence rising in June to its highest level in nearly 1-1/2 years.AAA expects 43 million people will drive to their destinations, a 4% increase from 2019 levels.Other modes of travel still have not reached pre-pandemic levels. The travel group expects about 3 million people will travel by bus, cruise liner, or train over the long weekend, up 24% from last year but 5% lower than 2019 levels.

And following a massive rally in tech, investors are looking for their next best bet. So what should you buy and what should you avoid? Here with some of his picks, Ken Mahoney of Mahoney Asset Management. Ken, it's good to see you again. So let's just start where we're closing out the year or closing out the first half of the year I should say and that's all the focus on tech. Questions about valuation, whether or not they're still a buying opportunity within the sector. What do you think?KEN MAHONEY: I think there is. It's still our top holdings and what great first half of the year. Happy Friday to you. I mean, think about it, it's the best first half for the NASDAQ in 40 years and think AI is the culprit. All good news around AI and the adaptation of it. I mean, companies are going to be able to help out their top line, reduce costs in the bottom line. I think we're only second or third inning, I know a lot of people think they missed the boat.But this is one of the biggest disruptors we're going to see in our lifetime, the use of AI. So you saw the leadership, picks and shovels of AI, Microsoft this quarter, AMD, NVIDIA. These are some of the names I think are going to be around for some time and have the benefits of this huge movement we're going to have.- Why get in on this price point though? I mean NVIDIA alone, if you look at the run up in the stock it's up nearly 190% this year.KEN MAHONEY: No, we're not suggesting that. It's run parabolic. But the point is that there's still a lot of runway ahead of itself. What's going to happen somewhere when you say, OK, when is this really a bubble? When you find $3 stocks turn to $20 stocks. This is what we saw in the late 1990s.Story continuesWoke up one morning, called your company.com and then he values like triple, quadruple and so forth. That's going to happen. But we really do like the picks and shovels of this gold rush that's happening. I think the late 1990s was Oracle, it was Cisco. Well, now this time around companies like Microsoft, AMD, NVIDIA. But to your point, yes, it's parabolic.You can wait and put some prices below the market, good to cancel orders, try to get filled. Maybe that's probably a better approach. I'm not necessarily saying chase it, but certainly this is not the end of [INAUDIBLE] in this great quarter and there's no more profitability in front of us.- Ken, your second pick is the total opposite. It's a bit of a contrarian play. It has to do with energy sector, which has certainly been left in the dust this year. What's the best way to play it? And why do you think it's going to turn around?KEN MAHONEY: Right. So you have momentum going and we know momentum can cut both ways. Energy was a big winner last year. IYE is the symbol here of this ETF, which owns Mobil and Chevron. Pays a 3.5% dividend. And oh, by the way, I still believe there's an OPEC foot somewhere around $65 a share, $65 a barrel where it's hovering between $67 and $70 now. Again, we don't like it. We don't like it-- I'm sorry, we don't like that OPEC is running the way they're running and at any moment they can go and cut a million here, a million there.But that's where we are right now. Also, our strategic reserves are way, way down. At some point we're going to refill that. So I think the dynamics are this is so out of favor. You collect a decent dividend. I believe there's a pit below it here. Remember, there's a lot of geopolitical risk. I mean, over the last weekend the coup in Russia or the attempted coup. There's still some areas of instability. And any instability starts really getting some momentum. You're going to find oil go higher.- Let's talk about what are some of the stocks that you're saying stay away from. We're looking abroad for this one in particular. And we've had a lot of conversations about what is the right opportunity, especially in emerging markets. Why is Brazil the one to say you need to take a step and step away?KEN MAHONEY: Right. Well, I'm coming from you today from Saint Paulo, Brazil. So greetings. One hour ahead of you so. It's a socialist President Lula who came into office a few months ago. Year to date that ETF-- now by the way, this is for a very aggressive account of 15% to 20%. And again, if you look what happened in Venezuela, you looked at other places in South America, all these policies have not worked.This is a regime that's anti-business unless you're one of the cronies. This is a socialist and it's not going to work. Again, if you do short this stock or short this ETF or short anything around Brazil, use a buy, stop, protect yourself in case it goes against you. But right now, there's such a dichotomy between the way the stock market is performing here in Brazil and also the way the politics are going, which doesn't help, I believe. And again, around the world these sort of policies don't work.- And Ken, bringing you back here to the US. One of the other pick that you have to avoid right now is Target. The consumer discretionary play, the retailer. Why don't you think we'll see a better second half from the company?KEN MAHONEY: So we're really not-- really going to like retailers. We think Amazon is still eating a lot of retailer's lunch. And since the pandemic we've all changed, right? So it used to be about buying things and going to Walmart or your favorite store. Now things are changed.People want to travel. You see airline bookings. You see hotel bookings. You see Airbnb bookings. People are shifting their spending habits away from retail. And of course, Target really tripped themselves up with pride, which is something that a lot of corporations are celebrating. But the way they rolled it out really hurt their demographics. I don't know if they could recover from that.But certainly you have companies that are beating estimates and raising guidance. Time and time again you're finding retailers missing the estimates and lowering guidance. We don't be anywhere near companies like that because it's like sitting in quicksand. And I suspect this quarter that they're in they're probably miss the estimates-- I'm sorry, miss the numbers and lower estimates. We don't want to be there.- All right. Ken Mahoney, great to have you here. Target off just about 11% since the start of the year. Thanks.]"

JAKKS Pacific’s licensing partners are responsible for some of the most popular intellectual properties in the world, including The Walt Disney Company, Marvel, Pixar, DC Comics, Warner Bros., NBC Universal and so many others.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s outlook for 2023 and beyond is promising.

PLNT have declined 14% in the past six months against the industry’s growth of 26.4%. Inflation concerns are affecting the company. Chances of increase in costs of materials, shipping, equipment and labor are likely to impact its profitability.However, strategic efforts, robust digitalization and solid brand presence bode well. Our model predicts PLNT’s earnings and sales in 2023 to witness growth of 33.1% and 12.8% year over year, respectively.Let’s delve deeper and find out why investors should retain the stock despite dismal performance in the past six months.Factors Likely to Drive GrowthThe Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is one of the largest and fastest-growing franchisors and operators of fitness centers in the United States. To boost its presence in Mexico, PLNT announced a joint venture made up of a prominent local retail services company and one of its largest U.S. developers. The agreement is set for the development of a minimum of 80 new stores over the next five years.  In an effort to expand its presence, Planet Fitness has been focusing on strategic partnerships and international expansions. It collaborated with iFit, a leader in online streaming home workouts. With this partnership, it also initiated a series of new workouts with minimal or no equipment, thereby making it available to everyone exclusively on the Planet Fitness App.The company continues to focus on its marketing muscle to drive growth. Management stated that it has transitioned from 16 marketing agencies to one Publicis Groupe to fuel incremental member growth. The agency will be looking after PLNT’s creative and media placement for its annual New Year's sale. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research For first-quarter 2023, Planet Fitness reported solid membership conversions on the back of its marketing and promotional offers. Also, it outpaced 2019 levels. During the quarter, membership levels came in at more than 18.1 million compared with 16.6 million in the previous quarter. For the rest of 2023, the company expects regularized joining trends and seasonality to continue.Apart from attracting new members to its brand, engaging existing members via its mobile app is a priority. PLNT intends to achieve this by focusing on driving downloads, app usage and enhanced functionality such as referral incentives, in-app messaging, notifications and enhanced account management tools.Meanwhile, Planet Fitness is witnessing solid traffic in its digital platform from both existing and non-existing members, particularly for iFit content. To encash on the positive trend, the company has announced a minority stake in the iFIT Health &amp; Fitness business, during first-quarter 2021.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

Also, its focus on SEA Change program bodes well. However, increased expenses are a concern.Let us discuss why investors should retain the stock for the time being.Key Growth DriversShares of Carnival have gained 112.9% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 26.7% growth. The company has been benefiting from solid demand for cruising, strong pricing environment and capacity-generation initiatives. Also, it stated the benefits from new marketing campaign and demand-generation efforts. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the company's search performance increased 63% from the prior quarter’s figure and 87% from 2019 levels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company gains from solid booking trends. During the fiscal second quarter, the company reported solid bookings for the North America and Australia (NAA) and Europe segments. The upside was backed by strong demand, bundled package offerings and pre-cruise sales. During the quarter, the company's NAA bookings curve is further out than 2019 levels, while the European recovery trajectory brought it within 10% of 2019 levels. The company stated that its remaining 2023 cumulative advanced booked position is at increased prices compared with 2019 levels. Total customer deposits as of May 31 were at an all-time high of $7.2 billion compared with $5.7 billion reported in the previous quarter. The amount was higher than $6 billion reported in 2019.Increased focus on new ship additions bode well. In second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company had 14 newly-delivered ships, comprising about 25% of its capacity. It announced the addition of Carnival Venezia to its Carnival Cruise Line fleet. The company anticipates the delivery of the Seabourn luxury expedition ship in fiscal 2023. Also, it emphasized on a pipeline of four ships to be delivered through 2025.Story continuesDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2023, CCL announced its SEA Change Program. The program was started with the intention of achieving sig nificant strategic objectives over a three-year period concluding in 2026.  The main performance goals are to increase adjusted EBITDA per ALBD by 50% (compared with the 2023 June guidance), reduce carbon intensity by more than 20% (relative to 2019) and achieve 12% adjusted return on invested capital.ConcernsCarnival is bearing the brunt of high expenses for quite some time. During the fiscal second quarter, adjusted cruise costs (excluding fuel per ALBD) increased 13.5% (in constant currency) from 2019 levels. The upside was primarily driven by a rise in dry-dock related expenses, higher advertising investments and incentive compensation increases. For third-quarter fiscal 2023, the company anticipates adjusted cruise costs to increase in the range of 12.5-13.5% from 2019 levels.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCarnival currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are as follows:Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications.

(NASDAQ:ADI) Could Be Worth Watching",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-analog-devices-inc-nasdaq-120057477.html,1688212857,STORY,['ADI'],"[Let's talk about the popular Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Analog Devices’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices What Is Analog Devices Worth?According to my valuation model, Analog Devices seems to be fairly priced at around 13.03% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Analog Devices today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $172.36, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Analog Devices’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Analog Devices generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Analog Devices' earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ADI’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ADI, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Analog Devices from their most recent forecasts.

May’s data was also revised upward from 102.3 to 102.5.The Present Situation Index, which gauges consumers’ views on current market conditions, rose to 155.3 in June from 148.9 in May. The Expectations Index, which is a measure of consumers’ short-term (next six months) outlook on income, business and labor market conditions, surged to 79.3 in June from 71.5 in May.The Expectations Index has remained below 80 (the level indicates expectations of a recession within a year) since February 2022 excluding last December. However, the data for June showed that the index is just marginally below the threshold of 80 buoyed by a solid month-over-month uplift.According to Dana Peterson, Chief Economist at The Conference Board, “Assessments of the present situation rose in June on sunnier views of both business and employment conditions. Likewise, expectations for the next six months improved materially, reflecting greater confidence about future business conditions and job availability.”Importantly, the 12-month forward inflation expectations gauge fell to 6% in June, marking the lowest reading since December 2020. In June, considerably fewer consumers expected a recession for the next 12 months compared to May.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer-centric stocks with strong upside potential for the rest of 2023.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.News Corporation (NWSA) is a stock many investors are watching right now. NWSA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 24.17 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 26.15. NWSA's Forward P/E has been as high as 27.67 and as low as 13.47, with a median of 19.57, all within the past year.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is NWSA's P/B ratio of 1.25. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.54. Over the past year, NWSA's P/B has been as high as 1.36 and as low as 0.95, with a median of 1.12.These are just a handful of the figures considered in News Corporation's great Value grade.

196,f8da4c4e-038d-3689-a6a9-9cb71e59a2d4,VZ,2023-07-01,Investors Heavily Search Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-verizon-communications-130013036.html,1688130013,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned +3.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless National industry, which Verizon falls in, has gained 3.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share, indicating a change of -10.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.68 points to a change of -9.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.68 indicates a change of +0.1% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Verizon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Verizon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $33.54 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $135.08 billion and $136.76 billion estimates indicate -1.3% and +1.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $32.91 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.9%. EPS of $1.20 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.71 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.36%. The EPS surprise was +0.84%.Over the last four quarters, Verizon surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And following a massive rally in tech, investors are looking for their next best bet. So what should you buy and what should you avoid? Here with some of his picks, Ken Mahoney of Mahoney Asset Management. Ken, it's good to see you again. So let's just start where we're closing out the year or closing out the first half of the year I should say and that's all the focus on tech. Questions about valuation, whether or not they're still a buying opportunity within the sector. What do you think?KEN MAHONEY: I think there is. It's still our top holdings and what great first half of the year. Happy Friday to you. I mean, think about it, it's the best first half for the NASDAQ in 40 years and think AI is the culprit. All good news around AI and the adaptation of it. I mean, companies are going to be able to help out their top line, reduce costs in the bottom line. I think we're only second or third inning, I know a lot of people think they missed the boat.But this is one of the biggest disruptors we're going to see in our lifetime, the use of AI. So you saw the leadership, picks and shovels of AI, Microsoft this quarter, AMD, NVIDIA. These are some of the names I think are going to be around for some time and have the benefits of this huge movement we're going to have.- Why get in on this price point though? I mean NVIDIA alone, if you look at the run up in the stock it's up nearly 190% this year.KEN MAHONEY: No, we're not suggesting that. It's run parabolic. But the point is that there's still a lot of runway ahead of itself. What's going to happen somewhere when you say, OK, when is this really a bubble? When you find $3 stocks turn to $20 stocks. This is what we saw in the late 1990s.Story continuesWoke up one morning, called your company.com and then he values like triple, quadruple and so forth. That's going to happen. But we really do like the picks and shovels of this gold rush that's happening. I think the late 1990s was Oracle, it was Cisco. Well, now this time around companies like Microsoft, AMD, NVIDIA. But to your point, yes, it's parabolic.You can wait and put some prices below the market, good to cancel orders, try to get filled. Maybe that's probably a better approach. I'm not necessarily saying chase it, but certainly this is not the end of [INAUDIBLE] in this great quarter and there's no more profitability in front of us.- Ken, your second pick is the total opposite. It's a bit of a contrarian play. It has to do with energy sector, which has certainly been left in the dust this year. What's the best way to play it? And why do you think it's going to turn around?KEN MAHONEY: Right. So you have momentum going and we know momentum can cut both ways. Energy was a big winner last year. IYE is the symbol here of this ETF, which owns Mobil and Chevron. Pays a 3.5% dividend. And oh, by the way, I still believe there's an OPEC foot somewhere around $65 a share, $65 a barrel where it's hovering between $67 and $70 now. Again, we don't like it. We don't like it-- I'm sorry, we don't like that OPEC is running the way they're running and at any moment they can go and cut a million here, a million there.But that's where we are right now. Also, our strategic reserves are way, way down. At some point we're going to refill that. So I think the dynamics are this is so out of favor. You collect a decent dividend. I believe there's a pit below it here. Remember, there's a lot of geopolitical risk. I mean, over the last weekend the coup in Russia or the attempted coup. There's still some areas of instability. And any instability starts really getting some momentum. You're going to find oil go higher.- Let's talk about what are some of the stocks that you're saying stay away from. We're looking abroad for this one in particular. And we've had a lot of conversations about what is the right opportunity, especially in emerging markets. Why is Brazil the one to say you need to take a step and step away?KEN MAHONEY: Right. Well, I'm coming from you today from Saint Paulo, Brazil. So greetings. One hour ahead of you so. It's a socialist President Lula who came into office a few months ago. Year to date that ETF-- now by the way, this is for a very aggressive account of 15% to 20%. And again, if you look what happened in Venezuela, you looked at other places in South America, all these policies have not worked.This is a regime that's anti-business unless you're one of the cronies. This is a socialist and it's not going to work. Again, if you do short this stock or short this ETF or short anything around Brazil, use a buy, stop, protect yourself in case it goes against you. But right now, there's such a dichotomy between the way the stock market is performing here in Brazil and also the way the politics are going, which doesn't help, I believe. And again, around the world these sort of policies don't work.- And Ken, bringing you back here to the US. One of the other pick that you have to avoid right now is Target. The consumer discretionary play, the retailer. Why don't you think we'll see a better second half from the company?KEN MAHONEY: So we're really not-- really going to like retailers. We think Amazon is still eating a lot of retailer's lunch. And since the pandemic we've all changed, right? So it used to be about buying things and going to Walmart or your favorite store. Now things are changed.People want to travel. You see airline bookings. You see hotel bookings. You see Airbnb bookings. People are shifting their spending habits away from retail. And of course, Target really tripped themselves up with pride, which is something that a lot of corporations are celebrating. But the way they rolled it out really hurt their demographics. I don't know if they could recover from that.But certainly you have companies that are beating estimates and raising guidance. Time and time again you're finding retailers missing the estimates and lowering guidance. We don't be anywhere near companies like that because it's like sitting in quicksand. And I suspect this quarter that they're in they're probably miss the estimates-- I'm sorry, miss the numbers and lower estimates. We don't want to be there.- All right. Ken Mahoney, great to have you here. Target off just about 11% since the start of the year. Thanks.]"

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is The Travelers Companies (TRV). TRV is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 10.94, while its industry has an average P/E of 25.87. Over the last 12 months, TRV's Forward P/E has been as high as 14.22 and as low as 10.46, with a median of 11.99.TRV is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.18. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. TRV's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 2.45. TRV's PEG has been as high as 3.53 and as low as 1.05, with a median of 2.31, all within the past year.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that The Travelers Companies is likely undervalued currently.

The judge accepted the filing and closed the case.Although the notice did not reference the terms of the settlement, Grossberg's attorney, Parisis G. Filippatos, said in an interview that his client will receive $12 million.In a statement, Fox News said: ""We are pleased that we have been able to resolve this matter without further litigation.”Grossberg said in a statement that while she stands by claims she made in her Manhattan lawsuit and another lawsuit in the Delaware State Superior Court, she was “heartened that Fox News has taken me and my legal claims seriously. I am hopeful, based on our discussions with Fox News today, that this resolution represents a positive step by the Network regarding its treatment of women and minorities in the workplace.”The Manhattan lawsuit claimed that Fox's legal team “coerced, intimidated, and misinformed"" Grossberg during preparations for her testimony in a legal battle between the network and Dominion, an elections technology company.She maintained in the lawsuit that she had received “damaging and woefully inferior and inadequate legal representation"" compared to male counterparts at Fox News and that the experience had resulted in “irretrievable reputational and emotional harm.”In April, just before opening statements were to begin at trial, Fox agreed to pay more than $787 million to settle the lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems over the network’s airing of false claims following the 2020 presidential election. The settlement was reached shortly before Carlson was expected to be called to testify.Story continuesLess than a week later, on April 24, Carlson, the network’s most popular personality, was fired. Grossberg had worked as “Head of Booking” for Carlson from Sept. 5 until March.In her federal lawsuit, Grossberg asserted that Carlson's show had a cruel and misogynistic workplace, and that she had been pressured to give misleading testimony during a pretrial deposition in the Dominion case.As Grossberg noted in the lawsuit, Dominion had quoted from her deposition in one of its pretrial court filings to support its position that Fox News hosts, producers and executives knew statements about the 2020 election being “stolen” from President Donald Trump were false or recklessly disregarded the truth.The lawsuit said Dominion directly cited Grossberg’s answer when she was posed the question: “If someone says something untrue on one of your shows, do you think it’s important to correct it?”“No,” she answered.Her lawsuit said: “This was not the testimony Ms. Grossberg wanted to give but she had been conditioned and felt coerced to give this response that simultaneously painted her in a negative light as a professional.”According to her lawsuit, she requested a copy of her deposition transcript after her deposition and expressed concern that her testimony was not fully accurate because of the intimidating and confusing coaching she'd received. But lawyers at Fox News withheld the transcript.When prominent media outlets called her journalism and professional ethnics into question based on excerpts of her deposition included in Dominion's pretrial arguments, Grossberg began to experience severe anxiety and stress because of the public distribution of her uncorrected transcript, the lawsuit said.]"

She had worked for Fox since 2019.In firing her, Fox said her legal claims were ""riddled with false allegations against Fox and our employees.""In seeking unspecified monetary damages, Grossberg claimed to have been subjected to a hostile and discriminatory work environment. She accused Fox among other things of gender and religious discrimination as well as pay equity violations.She had also sought unspecified damages in a similar lawsuit in Delaware Superior Court, which she dismissed in May.Grossberg said that during preparation with Fox lawyers for her September 2022 deposition in the Dominion lawsuit, she felt “coerced and intimidated into not saying anything that would make her become Dominion’s ‘star’ witness.”Story continuesDominion had sued Fox seeking $1.6 billion for promoting false vote-rigging claims involving the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Had the Dominion case gone to trial, Grossberg could have been a key witness.Grossberg said Fox subjected her to sexism, misogyny and antisemitism.Carlson was among the defendants in Grossberg's Manhattan lawsuit. The program on which Grossberg worked, ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" was the top-rated prime-time U.S. cable TV news show.Grossberg claimed that Carlson made derogatory comments toward women, and cited incidents such as Carlson's staff discussing whether Michigan's Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, was ""hotter"" and better at sex than Republican opponent Tudor Dixon.Grossberg alleged that on her first day on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" she discovered many photographs of octogenarian then-House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi shown in a plunging bathing suit, revealing the Democrat's cleavage, on her computer and elsewhere throughout the office.She also alleged that a member of Carlson's staff called Grossberg into his office and asked her whether Maria Bartiromo, whom she had worked for before Carlson, was having sex with Republican Representative Kevin McCarthy, now the U.S. House speaker.Grossberg alleged that an executive for Carlson's show once remarked that the ""mother's room,"" an office designated for network employees to pump breast milk, was a ""waste of space"" and should be replaced with a ""room of tanning beds for the guys to tan their testicles.""

214,c5a937c7-84e9-3258-951f-39b7f891f721,CHRW,2023-07-01,RXO outlook cut to negative but important debt rating not reduced,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rxo-outlook-cut-negative-important-143356004.html,1688135636,STORY,"['CHRW', 'RXO']","[RXO held on to its S&amp;P debt rating but its outlook was reduced to ""stable."" (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)RXO has hung on to its BB+ rating from S&amp;P Global, but the outlook on the company has been dropped down one level.RXO, spun off from XPO (NYSE: XPO) last fall, was given a BB+ rating by S&amp;P Global Ratings at the time the brokerage company became a separate entity. At the same time, RXO was also given a “positive” outlook by S&amp;P, which suggested that credit and market conditions for the company were strong enough so that an increase in the rating was possible in the coming 12 months.That move from BB+ to BBB- is one of the most significant upgrades that can occur to a debt rating at S&amp;P Global, because it takes a company from the top level of the non-investment grade category to the lowest level of investment grade. But even the top level of non-investment grade carries the colloquial description of “junk.” The lowest level of investment grade does not.The S&amp;P definition of a “positive” outlook is that a rating may be increased, with the outlook going out two years for investment-grade companies and up to one year for speculative-grade companies. The stable outlook means a rating is not likely to change.Outside of costs connected to the spinoff of RXO (NYSE: RXO) from XPO, there is nothing else in the S&amp;P Ratings report on the company that suggests concern about its financial practices. Rather, the summary of the move from an outlook of “positive” to one of “stable” is completely connected to the state of the freight market.“We no longer expect RXO’s credit metrics will support an upgrade in 2023,” S&amp;P Global said in its report, issued Wednesday. “RXO, like other truck brokers, faces a weaker freight transportation environment in 2023 following an extended period of strong pricing and demand.”S&amp;P also said RXO is suffering from excess trucking capacity, which has not been “meaningfully” reduced. “This dynamic has contributed to spot market pricing falling approximately 40% in recent weeks from its peak in early 2022.”Story continuesBut S&amp;P does not just cite the status of the truckload market. Its last-mile delivery operations “face shifting consumer spending patterns, and its ocean and air freight forwarding segment is subject to weaker market conditions on key import routes.”The “base scenario” that S&amp;P Ratings is using in its review is that freight pricing will rise in 2024 “as some carriers exit the market.”In the immediate term, that isn’t good news for brokers like RXO. “Typically, profitability for truck brokers is counter-cyclical,” S&amp;P Ratings said. “Brokers generally purchase capacity on the spot market and bill customers under contracted rates on a portion of loads. Thus, margins tend to decline when spot market prices increase since brokers must purchase capacity above contracted prices.”But even with those trends that would not be positive for RXO, S&amp;P Ratings said its primary reason why it believes the company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will decline to 5% this year from 6.1% last year are costs associated with the XPO spinoff. EBITDA should jump back to a 6% to 7% range next year once those costs are completed.RXO’s first-quarter earnings were significantly stronger than peers such as C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW), where the adjusted earnings per share was down more than 50% year on year, and Landstar (NASDAQ: LSTR), which is a less-than-perfect comparison to a more pure-play 3PL like RXO but also saw an EPS decline of more than 50%. Adjusted net income at RXO was down a little less than 40% and other measurements were seen as surprisingly strong as well. RXO and C.H. Robinson have both now suffered the same fate at the hands of S&amp;P Global in recent weeks: a lowering of the outlook for the companies without a change in their debt ratings. Earlier this month, C.H. Robinson’s outlook was reduced to negative from stable but it held on to its BBB+ rating. That is three notches above the now-affirmed rating for RXO, but the C.H. Robinson debt rating is investment grade.RXO’s first-quarter performance compared to other companies is implicitly acknowledged by S&amp;P Ratings in its report.“We believe RXO will continue to outperform its peers and increase brokerage volumes,” it said. “Despite unfavorable market conditions in the first quarter, RXO reported a 6% volume increase in truck brokerage from the same period the previous year while maintaining a gross margin above its peers.”A key reason for that outperformance, according to S&amp;P, is that RXO “proprietary” technology “allows it to procure capacity more efficiently and improves the experience of its carriers and customers. We also believe this should support the company’s operating performance when freight conditions improve.”S&amp;P’s primary focus will always be on a company’s ability to finance its debt burden.

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.23%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.84%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.24%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the engine maker had gained 16.99% over the past month. This has lagged the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's gain of 20.58% and outpaced the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.67% in that time.Cummins will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Cummins to post earnings of $5.17 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 8.39%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $8.24 billion, up 25.13% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $19.87 per share and revenue of $32.81 billion. These totals would mark changes of +31.42% and +16.88%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Cummins. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently.

It was conducted by David Neumark, a University of California Irvine professor and labor economist.Disney disputes the findings.""The plaintiffs' assertions about an alleged pay gap between women and men are simply false, which we will demonstrate through the litigation,"" said Shawna M. Swanson, associate general counsel and head of the employment law function for Disney.The original suit was filed by LaRonda Rasmussen in 2019, after she learned that six men with the same job title earned substantially more, including one recent hire with several years less experience, who earned $20,000 more, according to the complaint. Nine current or past Disney employees have joined the suit.""Several of the named plaintiffs, they do love the Disney brand, they just want to be paid fairly,"" said Lori Andrus, the plaintiffs' lead attorney.Lower pay for women in California would breach the state's Equal Pay Act and the Fair Employment &amp; Housing Act.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)]"

Members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) walked off the job on May 2, forcing many film and TV productions to shut down.A-list stars including Jennifer Lawrence and Meryl Streep, in a letter to union leadership this week, said they were ready to walk off the job if negotiators failed to reach a ""transformative deal"" on higher base pay and safeguards around use of artificial intelligence (AI).The letter came days after union negotiators issued a video saying their talks had been ""extremely productive,"" a possible sign that a deal was within reach.In a message to members on Friday, SAG-AFTRA's negotiators they had unanimously agreed to the contract extension ""in order to exhaust every opportunity to achieve the righteous contract we all demand and deserve.""""No one should mistake this extension for weakness,"" they said.SAG-AFTRA voted in early June to give its leaders the authority to call a work stoppage if talks were to break down.Negotiations were taking place during a difficult time for Hollywood studios. Conglomerates are under pressure from Wall Street to make their streaming services profitable after pumping billions of dollars into programming to attract subscribers.The rise of streaming has eroded television ad revenue as traditional TV audiences shrink.Story continuesThe walkout by 11,500 writers has shut down a wide swath of TV production and delayed the filming of movies including Marvel's ""Thunderbolts"" and ""Blade."" Any ongoing filming would have to halt if actors also strike.Leaders of SAG-AFTRA, which represents 160,000 actors, and the WGA say the entertainment industry has changed dramatically with the rise of streaming television and the emergence of technology such as generative AI, which they fear could be used to write scripts or create digital actors.The AMPTP, which negotiates on behalf of the studios, has declined to comment about its talks with SAG-AFTRA. The two sides have agreed to keep negotiating without discussing the talks with the media, according to a joint statement on Friday.With the writers, the AMPTP said it had offered ""generous"" pay increases but could not agree to all of the writers' demands. The studios and the WGA have not held talks since the writers' strike began on May 2.The WGA walkout is hitting caterers, prop suppliers and other small businesses that generate a large portion of their income from Hollywood productions. The last writers' strike in 2007 and 2008 cost the California economy an estimated $2.1 billion.(Reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Hanna Rantala and Sarah Mills in London; Editing by Mary Milliken, Rosalba O'Brien, Cynthia Osterman, Simon Cameron-Moore and William Mallard)]"

224,cdbc1a27-ab4b-32db-97ae-f8e50d38f132,EXC,2023-07-01,The chief of Exelon is one of only 9 Black Fortune 500 CEOs and says corporate America has to be ‘unapologetic’ in its diversity push despite the backlash,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chief-exelon-one-only-8-103000705.html,1688121000,STORY,['EXC'],"[When Calvin Butler became chief executive of electric utility operator Exelon in late 2022, he entered the small but growing club of Black CEOs at Fortune 500 companies. Butler, 53, was soon joined by the new top executive of another large utility in May, Southern Co.’s Christopher Womack, bringing the number of Black CEOs on the list to eight.While that tally is a new record, and features heavy hitters like Roz Brewer of Walgreens Boots Alliance, it still underscores how underrepresented Black executives are in American corner offices, given that 12.4% of the U.S. population identifies as Black. Butler says large companies have to keep pushing their diversity initiatives, as well as be consistent about identifying talent and nurturing it.That means giving promising aspiring executives assignments that challenge them, despite the noise out there against diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. “We have a very diverse team at Exelon, and that didn’t happen because one day I woke up one morning and said, ‘Let’s make a diverse team,‘“ Butler told Fortune. “We have to be very intentional about it and unapologetic.”Butler has worked for 15 years at Exelon, which owns six utilities in the mid-Atlantic and Midwest. He credits his mentors with advocating for and giving him tough assignments, from operations to human resources to mergers. And he doesn’t buy into the notion that companies can’t find enough Black talent. He contends they have to look harder within their own ranks to find high-potential employees, whether Black or from another underrepresented group. “I disagree with the premise that there’s not enough people of color ready to step into CEO roles,” Butler says.REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration (Dado Ruvic / reuters)This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.Fortune: You are now one of nine Black CEOs in the Fortune 500, a record number but still a major underrepresentation. How can corporate America build a fuller pipeline of talent?We have to be more intentional in our diversity efforts. Just as corporate America started years ago to be more intentional about engaging in promoting and providing opportunity for women, it must be intentional about doing that for African American and Latinx leaders within any organization. I disagree with the premise that there are not enough Black people ready to step into a CEO role. I believe there are plenty who have been ready to lead Fortune 500 companies, well before now. They’re here today, they’ll be here tomorrow. It’s a matter of the culture of organizations being ready to accept that.Story continuesThere is so much pushback nowadays against talk of DEI or ESG. Could this hurt efforts to bring more people of color and others from underrepresented groups into the C-suites of the nation?At Exelon, it’s a core value of who we are. If we stand for our values, it doesn’t really matter what everyone else says. Where people get into trouble is when they get pushback and then go against the values they say they represent.What about diversity of opinions? Surely not every one of your 19,000 employees believes in the same things. What’s your message to employees who may tell you they have a different view of diversity efforts?You’re absolutely right that not everybody shares those values, but they know ours. I will say to them, “Our values are very clear. I’d love for you to stay working here, but if this is not the company for you, that’s okay, too. Just like I’m respecting you disagreeing with me, you need to respect others you work with. And as long as you come to work and don’t disrespect those you work with, we have no concerns.” I do receive those emails, and I respond to them exactly in that way.When you see the kerfuffles around Disney, Target, Bud Light, does it give you pause about how vocal to be on matters of DEI?It doesn’t give me pause. What it does is it requires us to be very clear in our communications. Think about the examples you cited. They wavered in their values. They took a position initially and stepped away from them. Your employees look for consistency, as do your customers.You’re a first-time CEO and benefited from mentoring and higher-ups giving you opportunities to learn different aspects of operations, something a trained lawyer needs when rising at a utility. How did you map your way to the top?Your next move doesn’t always have to be a move up. I use the expression, “Be ready at all times to leave.” I just added different tools to my tool belt along my career. There is only one top job, and when you are being considered for that top position, you want to have a portfolio that shows you’re a diverse, experienced leader and can lead across multiple segments. I’ve run operations, government affairs, legal, regulatory functions, and ran HR for a year. And when you look at the job of CEO, it’s all those things. So I’ve taken many side steps to ensure I had the experience. I’m not the expert, but I know how to engage my teams to get the best out of them because I’ve sat in their seat.Let’s talk about Exelon’s business now. You’re in a regulated industry, so where does growth come from next?The further electrification in our communities and in our infrastructure are leading to growth. Take Walmart, one of our largest customers for our portfolio of six utilities. They are electrifying their vehicle fleet, as well as their stores for electric vehicle charging. Amazon and UPS are also electrifying their fleets among others. And we want to help build out electric-vehicle charging stations where people live. We are committed to all neighborhoods, and we cannot leave any traditionally under-resourced neighborhoods in this transition.What about data centers, which rely on enormous amounts of electricity? You’re seeing a lot of data center activity emerge in the Chicago suburbs where Exelon operates.The Chicago suburbs are bringing on more data centers than any other part of the country right now. That’s because of the cost, but also the reliability. The quality of power is becoming more of a priority because supercomputers need reliability in their ability to connect to the grid, and the voltage quality, because any dips affect their whole operation. So data centers are a big opportunity for us.Get to know Butler:Butler is a lawyer by training and attended law school at Washington University in St. Louis.He organizes a loose version of a C-suite book of the month club, asking his leadership team to discuss the selection.

This milestone marks a step forward in ONEOK's $18.8 billion acquisition of Magellan and brings the transaction closer to completion.The HSR Act is designed to allow the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to review and evaluate the potential antitrust implications of certain mergers and acquisitions before they are finalized.The exhaustion of the waiting period satisfies one of the conditions necessary for the successful completion of the aforementioned acquisition. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, subject to approval by ONEOK’s shareholders and Magellan’s unitholders, along with other customary conditions.Once completed, this buyout will create one of the largest energy pipeline operators, combining the expertise and assets of both companies. Although the deal initially appeared to be a sure thing, factors like current share prices and the arbitrage spread have led to speculations about a 50-50 chance of its completion.ONEOK is a midstream service provider with a top natural gas liquids system in the United States. It connects supplies in Rocky Mountain, Permian and Mid-Continent regions with key market centers. The company’s extensive network includes gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation and storage assets, making it a key player in the industry.Magellan is a Tulsa-based master limited partnership that operates a diversified portfolio of energy infrastructure assets, primarily transporting, storing, and distributing refined petroleum products and ammonia. With the longest refined petroleum pipeline system in the United States, MMP has access to nearly half of the domestic refining capacity. The company operates under two segments — Refined Products and Crude Oil.Story continuesThe acquisition brings together two premier energy infrastructure businesses, offering strong returns on invested capital and diverse free cash flow generation. The companies expect to achieve immediate financial benefits, including cost, operational and tax synergies, resulting in meaningful accretion.The combination of complementary and diversified asset positions provides the potential for additional cost and commercial synergies over time. Moreover, the enhanced scale and diversification will contribute to strong investment-grade credit ratings for the combined company.The completion of the buyout will consolidate the strengths and capabilities of both MMP and OKE, enabling them to better serve the energy industry and meet the evolving demands of the market. It also signifies a significant development in the energy sector and paves the way for enhanced operations and growth opportunities.Zacks Rank and Price PerformanceMMP currently carries a Zacks #3 (Hold).

But the main game is to find enough winners to more than offset the losers So we wouldn't blame long term F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 17% over a half decade.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for F5 In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the five years over which the share price declined, F5's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 4.8% each year. The share price decline of 4% per year isn't as bad as the EPS decline. So the market may previously have expected a drop, or else it expects the situation will improve.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on F5's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 16% in the last year, F5 shareholders lost 4.8%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 3% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  F5 is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Story continuesWe will like F5 better if we see some big insider buys.

VSAT recently announced the successful completion of thermal vacuum testing of the first of two satellites for the Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission. The company joined forces with Space Norway Heosat, a strategic space infrastructure developer, to conduct the mission and accelerate the establishment of a reliable communication system in the Arctic area.The Arctic region is witnessing rising commercial activity from shipping enterprises, airlines, government agencies and scientists. The surge of interest is mainly stemming from a combination of economic, geopolitical, environmental and social factors. The shrinking ice is opening up new trade routes that offer faster and cost-efficient options for maritime trade between Asia, Europe and North America. The geopolitical significance of the area cannot be overlooked, as governments actively seek ways to assert their influence and protect their strategic interests in the region.The Arctic Circle is believed to possess a vast pool of unexploited natural resources and it is also bearing the brunt of climate change. Hence, there is growing interest from scientists to expedite research efforts on various subjects in the area, including environmental sustainability and more.Viasat, in collaboration with Space Norway, is undertaking positive initiatives to address this rapidly increasing connectivity demand in the Arctic region. The new satellites, which will carry Viasat’s GX10A and B payloads, will be deployed in a highly elliptical orbit (HEO) above Earth. The goal is to provide high-speed broadband connectivity to users in the far north by 2024.HEO satellites will seamlessly integrate with the Global Xpress constellation and enhance its coverage and capability to provide high-quality mobile broadband services. The satellite will operate in an oval-shaped orbit around the poles. They will accelerate when passing over the South Pole and decelerate when operating over the North Pole. Through these synchronized movements, the satellites will deliver optimum coverage in the northernmost part of the Earth.The provision of uninterrupted satellite broadband communications will promote cooperation among arctic states and various organizations. It will also enhance maritime governance and resource management while unlocking numerous opportunities to develop a sustainable and mutually beneficial ecosystem in the region.Viasat is making steady progress on the payload module for the second ViaSat-3 (EMEA) satellite in its own facilities. The company has confirmed the successful launch of its ViaSat-3 Americas satellite on May 1, 2023. ViaSat-3 class of Ka-band satellites are expected to provide enhanced bandwidth with greater flexibility.The ViaSat-3 constellation will offer high-speed and high-capacity connectivity to expand coverage and help bridge the digital divide in areas with limited Internet access. Momentous market traction of ViaSat-1 and ViaSat-2 satellites, coupled with strategically planned ViaSat-3 satellites, are likely to provide the company with a solid competitive edge over its peers, thereby bolstering growth in the long run.The stock has gained 47.7% over the past year against the industry's fall of 2.6%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchViasat currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).InterDigital, Inc.

""It’s the digital age now and the age of streaming, and it’s a whole different business model. So it really begs that we stand firm and hold strong and do right by the members in this industry and honor the massive contribution that they make. So I’m really in it to win it.""Possible 'double whammy' strikes would have 'long-term effects' Fran Drescher, left, president of SAG-AFTRA, and Meredith Stiehm, president of Writers Guild of America West, pose together during a rally by striking writers outside Paramount Pictures studio, Monday, May 8, 2023, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Drescher, along with the guild's national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, told members in a video posted on Saturday that ongoing talks have been ""extremely productive.""However, later reports suggested that wasn't necessarily the case with more than 1,000 actors including Drescher penning a letter to the guild that said they're ""prepared to strike"" if SAG doesn’t ""get all the way there"" in its talks with studios.""If SAG-AFTRA joins the WGA picket line, audiences should prepare for re-runs and extended delays for their favorite TV shows and movies,"" KPMG’s US National Media Leader Scott Purdy told Yahoo Finance in an email. ""Undoubtedly, this potential double whammy could have long-term effects on the film and television industry. Like the WGA strike, compensation and artificial intelligence are at the heart of this.""Story continues""While the writers are fighting for protections for the intellectual property they produce, the AI component could be just as significant for talent if AI can regenerate their image, likeness, and voice in TV, shows, [and] movies,"" he continued.""Bottom line: The production engine requires both writers and actors. Even if the WGA strike comes to an end, we’ll still be waiting for actors to come back before productions can begin again.""Hollywood actors may join writers on the picket lines. (gotpap/STAR MAX/IPx)It's been 58 days since the WGA strike first began with no end in sight as talks stall.The last strike, which lasted 100 days from November 2007 to February 2008, cost the Los Angeles County economy a whopping $2.5 billion, according to estimates from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, warned the box office, which remains in post-pandemic recovery mode, could suffer the longer the strike continues""The movies do not write themselves and this is really a situation [where] it's not impacting [the pipeline] now. The movies that are in theaters now were written well before the strike, but eventually that pipeline is going to dry up,"" he told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday. ""You've got to have new scripts, so hopefully that gets resolved sooner than later, because the box office right now is definitely on a roll.""There has been some good news in Hollywood after the Directors Guild of America (DGA) reached a deal on a new three-year contract earlier this month.The agreement included gains in wages and benefits, a 76% increase in foreign streaming residuals (a type of royalty payment), a ""groundbreaking agreement"" confirming that AI is not a person and therefore cannot perform the duties of DGA members, and the banning of live ammunition on sets after the October 2021 shooting death on the set of ""Rust.""Alexandra is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned +3.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.7% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, to which Devon Energy belongs, has gained 4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -46.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.14 points to a change of -26.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -3.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.63 indicates a change of +7.9% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Devon Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $3.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -29.1%. The $16.11 billion and $16.61 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -16% and +3.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $3.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.3%. EPS of $1.46 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.93 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.65%. The EPS surprise was +5.04%.Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered fiscal third quarter revenue within our guidance range, with gross margin and EPS above the range. The ongoing improvement of customer inventories and memory content growth are driving higher industry demand, while production cuts across the industry continue to help reduce excess supply. As a result, pricing trends are improving, and we have increased confidence that the industry has passed the bottom for both quarterly revenue and year-on-year revenue growth. Our technology leadership and strengthening product portfolio position us well across diverse growth markets, including AI and memory-centric computing. Beyond this downturn, we expect to see record TAM in calendar 2025 along with a return to more normalized levels of profitability.The impact of the May 21 decision by the Cyberspace Administration of China on Micron's business remains uncertain and fluid. Several Micron customers, including mobile OEMs, have been contacted by certain critical information infrastructure operators or representatives of the government in China concerning the future use of Micron products. As discussed before, Micron's revenue with companies headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors, accounts for approximately a quarter of Micron's worldwide revenue and remains the principal exposure. We currently estimate that approximately half of that China-headquartered customer revenue, which equates to a low double-digit percentage of Micron's worldwide revenue, is at risk of being impacted.This significant headwind is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. Micron is working to mitigate this impact over time and expects increased quarter-to-quarter revenue variability. Micron's long-term goal is to retain its worldwide DRAM and NAND share. Turning to technology. Micron continues to lead the industry in both DRAM and NAND technology. We are investing prudently to maintain our technology competitiveness while managing CapEx, node ramps and wafer start reductions to reduce our bit supply and align it with demand. Our industry-leading 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND nodes are achieving world-class yields, and the yield ramp for these nodes has been faster than any of our prior nodes. These leadership nodes provide a strong cost capability, along with best-in-class power and performance specifications that will be leveraged across the portfolio of DRAM and NAND products.In fiscal Q3, we achieved several important product qualifications on these advanced nodes and are well positioned to ramp them in fiscal 2024. We are also making good progress toward the introduction of our EUV-based 1-gamma node in 2025. This node will be manufactured first in our Taiwan site, where we already have EUV capability installed and operating in preparation for this ramp. We also recently announced plans to bring EUV technology to our fab in Hiroshima, Japan, with support from the Japanese government. Micron will be the first company to bring EUV technology to Japan for production. We are also advancing our global assembly and test network in order to support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in the future.In China, we announced an investment of approximately $600 million over the next several years in our operations in Xi'an. This builds on our long history of significant investment in our Xi'an assembly, packaging and test operations. As a part of this investment, we have decided to purchase the assembly equipment of our partner Powertech Semiconductor Xi'an, who has been operating inside our Xi'an facility for the last eight years. We also intend to construct a new building at our Xi'an site to provide space to add more product capabilities. This will allow us, over time, to serve more of the demand from our customers in China from the Xi'an site. In India, with the strong support of the Indian government, we will build a new assembly and test facility in Gujarat to address demand for the latter half of this decade.We are also increasing our investments in assembly and test capacity in Taiwan for high-bandwidth memory products as we gear up for stronger demand in this segment driven by the AI wave. Now turning to our end markets. Customers continued to make progress in reducing their excess inventory in fiscal Q3. Most customer inventories in the PC and smartphone segments are close to normal levels now, consistent with our forecast six months ago. Some of these inventory levels can get distorted by customer attempts to leverage current prices, which are deemed to be transient and unsustainable at these levels, to purchase additional volumes before prices rise significantly. Data center customer inventory is also improving and will likely normalize around the end of this calendar year or somewhat thereafter, depending on the growth in traditional data center spending.In data center, we saw strong sequential revenue growth in both cloud and enterprise in fiscal Q3, driven by some recovery from depressed sales levels in fiscal Q2. The recent acceleration in the adoption of generative AI is driving higher-than-expected industry demand for memory and storage for AI servers, while traditional server demand for mainstream data center applications continues to be lackluster. Micron's product portfolio and roadmap of innovative products position us to capture growth opportunities from AI and data-centric computing architectures for both training and inferencing. Increasingly large AI models with an exponentially growing number of parameters are driving demand for dramatically higher memory content. As we have said before, AI servers have six to eight times the DRAM content of a regular server and three times the NAND content.In fact, some customers are deploying AI compute capability with substantially higher memory content. A striking example is NVIDIA's DGX GH200 supercluster, which shows just how memory-intensive AI workloads can be; it provides developers the ability to support giant models with a massive, shared memory space of 144TB. A significant majority of that memory footprint is enabled by a joint development project between our two companies that extends Micron's low-power DRAM leadership to server class applications. We are proud to pioneer this differentiated LP DRAM innovation to deliver a significant reduction in data center power consumption compared to DDR-based solutions, helping to support our customers' green initiatives. High-bandwidth memory, used in high performance computing, is seeing very strong demand this year, driven by demand for generative AI.Software, Technology, ComponentsPhoto by christina wocintechchat on UnsplashWe are working closely with our customers and have begun sampling our industry-leading HBM3 product offering. The customer response has been strong, and we believe our HBM3 product delivers significantly higher bandwidth than competing solutions and establishes the new benchmark in performance and power consumption, supported by our 1-beta technology, TSV, and other innovations enabling a differentiated advanced packaging solution. We expect to begin a mass production ramp for this exciting HBM3 product in early calendar 2024 and to achieve meaningful revenues in fiscal 2024. Micron also has a strong position in the industry transition to D5, which is the latest generation of DDR memory. Our D5 percentage of DRAM shipments has more than doubled from fiscal Q2 to Q3, and we expect Micron D5 volume to cross over D4 at the end of first calendar quarter of 2024 versus mid-calendar 2024 for the industry.Micron's 1-alpha D5 modules are qualified and shipping to data center customers. We are also making good progress on our 1-beta-based, high-density 128 gigabyte D5 modules using a 32 gigabit die that optimizes cost and performance to provide customers with a lower cost-of-ownership solution for memory-intensive workloads like AI. We expect these high-density modules to ramp in calendar Q2 of 2024 with significant cost improvements over today's expensive TSV-based solutions in the industry. Our 96 gigabyte D5 high-density module built on 1-alpha technology, using 24 gigabit die, is already shipping in volume and delivers equivalent performance for the majority of workloads versus the more expensive TSV dual-die package-based 128 gigabyte modules.In data center SSDs, Micron's entire portfolio is now on 176-layer or 232-layer NAND, demonstrating our product and technology leadership. We are in a strong position to serve AI demand for fast storage as these data-intensive applications proliferate. In fiscal Q3, we launched the world's first 200-plus layer NAND data center SSD, and qualification is in progress at multiple key customers to support AI cluster installations. In fact, we have already passed qualification of this product at a critical server OEM partner. We also launched our extreme endurance data center SSD, which offers superior scalability and affordability versus hard drives. In PCs, we now forecast calendar 2023 PC unit volume to decline by a low double-digit percentage year-over-year, with PC units expected to be below the pre-COVID levels last seen in 2019.We are excited about the ongoing industry transition to D5 and are well positioned for it with our strong D5 product lineup. Industry client D5 mix is expected to cross over from D4 in early calendar 2024. In fiscal Q3, we achieved record quarterly client SSD bit shipments, driven by share growth in client SSDs as customers adopted our industry-leading solutions. Our SSD QLC bit shipment mix reached a new record for the third consecutive quarter, with growth in both client and consumer. Last month, we launched Crucial T700, the world's fastest Gen5 PCIe consumer SSD, built with our 232-layer NAND. In graphics, industry analysts continue to expect graphics' TAM growth CAGR to outpace the broader market, supported by applications across client and data center.We expect customer inventories to normalize in calendar Q3. We plan to introduce our next-generation G7 product on our industry-leading 1-beta node in the first half of calendar year 2024. In mobile, we now expect calendar 2023 smartphone unit volume to be down by a mid-single digit percentage year-over-year. While units are weaker, we are seeing stronger memory content growth driven by a mix shift toward premium phones and elasticity. We expect sequential growth in fiscal Q4 as customers prepare for upcoming product launches in the back half of calendar 2023. In fiscal Q3, we achieved key mobile customer qualifications on our 1-beta-based LP5X and started high-volume revenue shipments to Tier-1 OEMs. In addition, we achieved significant milestones in UFS with the qualification and ramp of a high-capacity uMCP5 featuring 16 gigabyte of DRAM and 512 gigabyte of NAND.We have also started to sample a new UFS 4 product based on our latest 232-layer NAND technology, which enables industry-leading performance for flagship handsets. Last, I'll cover the auto and industrial end markets, which represent over 20% of our revenue and contribute more stable revenue and profitability. Micron continues to lead in automotive, which is a key market and growth driver for us. In fiscal Q3, auto revenue reached another quarterly record and grew by a high single-digit percentage year-over-year. We continue to expect growth in auto memory demand for the second half of calendar 2023, driven by easing non-memory semiconductor supply, normalizing customer inventory levels, and increasing memory content per vehicle. The industrial market saw early signs of recovery in fiscal Q3.Inventory levels are stabilizing at distribution partners and at the majority of our customers. As a result, we expect an improvement in demand in the second half of calendar 2023. We are excited about our growth prospects in this market, as industrial customers continue to adopt and implement IoT, AI, and machine learning in the factory. Now, turning to industry outlook. Our expectations for calendar 2023 industry bit demand growth have been further reduced to low- to mid-single digits in DRAM and to high-single digits in NAND, which are well below the expected long-term CAGR of mid-teens percentage range in DRAM and low 20%s range in NAND. While the AI-driven demand has been stronger than our expectations three months ago, the PC, smartphone and traditional server demand forecasts are now lower.We continue to expect stronger industry bit shipments for DRAM and NAND in the second half of the calendar year, driven by secular content growth and continued improvement in customer inventory. While the industry demand forecast for calendar 2023 is now lower, the significant supply reductions across the industry have started to stabilize the market. We see both DRAM and NAND year-over-year supply growth to be negative for the industry in calendar 2023 as utilization and CapEx cuts across the industry impact supply growth. While supply demand balance is improving, due to the excess inventory, profitability and cash flow will remain extremely challenged for some time. Market recovery can accelerate if there is further reduction in industry production and these cuts are sustained well into calendar 2024.In response to the industry environment, Micron has taken decisive actions to bring our supply back in balance with demand. We expect Micron's year-on-year bit supply growth to be meaningfully negative for DRAM. We also expect to produce fewer NAND bits in calendar 2023 than in calendar 2022. Our fiscal 2023 CapEx plan of $7 billion is down more than 40% from last year, with WFE down more than 50%. We continue to expect fiscal 2024 WFE to be down year-on-year. Recently, we have further reduced wafer starts to approach 30% in both DRAM and NAND. We currently expect reduced wafer starts will continue well into calendar 2024 as we remain focused on managing down our inventories and controlling our supply. I will now turn it over to Mark.Mark Murphy: Thanks, Sanjay. Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal Q3 results were in line to better than expectations, with revenue coming in above the midpoint of our guidance range and gross margin and EPS exceeding the high end of the range. Total fiscal Q3 revenue was approximately $3.8 billion, up 2% sequentially and down 57% year-over-year. Fiscal Q3 revenue included $72 million from an insurance settlement disclosed at the time we provided guidance. Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $2.7 billion, representing 71% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 2% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the 10% range and prices declining by approximately 10%. Fiscal Q3 NAND revenue was $1 billion, representing 27% of Micron's total revenue.NAND revenue increased 14% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the upper 30% range and prices declining in the mid-teens percentage range. Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit revenue was $1.4 billion, up 1% sequentially. Strong sequential growth in server and graphics revenues was offset by a decline in client. Embedded Business Unit revenue was $912 million, up 5% sequentially. On a sequential basis, automotive and consumer revenues were strong. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $819 million, down 13% sequentially due to timing of shipments. As Sanjay mentioned, we expect growth in mobile revenues in fiscal Q4. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $627 million, up 24% sequentially and driven by increased shipments across most of the portfolio.The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q3 was negative 16%, improving 15 percentage points sequentially. This result was negatively impacted by approximately $400 million or 11 percentage points of write-downs associated with inventory produced in the quarter. Operating expenses in fiscal Q3 were $866 million, down roughly $50 million sequentially. OpEx benefited from ongoing expense-reduction initiatives and gains on sales of certain assets. We had an operating loss of roughly $1.5 billion in fiscal Q3, resulting in an operating margin of negative 39%, improved from negative 56% in the prior quarter. Fiscal Q3 taxes were $102 million, higher than expectations at the time of our guidance, driven by one-time discrete items. As mentioned in previous quarters, despite a consolidated loss on a worldwide basis, we still have taxes payable in certain geographies due to taxable income levels reported in those geographies.The non-GAAP loss per share in fiscal Q3 was $1.43, down from a loss per share of $1.91 in the prior quarter and earnings per share of $2.59 in the prior year. Fiscal Q3 EPS included approximately $0.37 of losses from the impact of the inventory write-down associated with inventory produced in the quarter. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. Our operating cash flows were approximately $24 million. Capital expenditures were $1.4 billion during the quarter. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $7 billion for the fiscal year, thus near $1 billion in fiscal Q4. Free cash flow was negative $1.4 billion in the quarter and improved from the previous two quarters. Our fiscal Q3 ending inventory was $8.2 billion or 168 days.Due to increases in process steps and product complexity, we now target inventory levels of around 120 days, which at present would equate to approximately $6 billion. Our current inventories include strategic stocks of approximately $1 billion over target levels associated with build-ahead of product for cost optimization and risk mitigation. At quarter-end, we held cash and investments of $11.4 billion and had total liquidity of $13.9 billion, including our untapped credit facility. We issued $1.5 billion of long-term debt in the quarter and, with part of those proceeds, paid down $600 million of our term loan facility, resulting in a net increase to debt of $900 million. Our fiscal Q3 ending debt was $13.2 billion. Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter.As mentioned in filings and our comments today, the CAC decision is a headwind to our outlook. We expect the revenue impact to vary by quarter, with the impact in fiscal Q4 being less than the quarterly impact in the first half of fiscal 2024. Over time, we have a goal of retaining our global market share in both DRAM and NAND. In fiscal Q4, as the industry demand continues to improve and despite the effects on our business from the CAC decision, we still see record bit shipments. Fiscal Q4 gross margin will be impacted by costs from underutilization, weak pricing levels and product mix. In the current business environment, the gap between our DRAM and NAND profitability is significant, and changes in the mix can drive large variability in gross margins.Our gross margin guidance does not contemplate additional write-downs of inventory. We continue to aggressively manage our operating expenses and remain on track to exit the fiscal year at less than $850 million. Looking beyond fiscal Q4, we expect OpEx to increase over $50 million in fiscal Q1 2024 on R&amp;D program expense timing and as reductions to employee compensation end. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q4 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $3.9 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of negative 10.5%, plus or minus 250 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $845 million, plus or minus $15 million. We expect tax expenses of approximately $40 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares, we expect EPS to be a loss of $1.19, plus or minus $0.07.In closing, we continue to act quickly and tenaciously to navigate this downturn, making the investments to maintain our leading capabilities across technology, products, and manufacturing while preserving our solid balance sheet. In this environment, we remain sharply focused on improving our profitability and free cash flow. As market conditions improve, we will continue to drive efficiencies to hold on productivity gains. Despite the impact of this downturn and effects of the CAC decision, we remain confident in our financial model and our ability to deliver long-term profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. I will now turn it back over to Sanjay.Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Mark. I am proud of the execution of the Micron team and the progress we made this quarter. The leadership products we released and qualified are strengthening Micron's portfolio across multiple key markets. While there are near-term headwinds, I am excited about the new product introductions that we have planned for the next several quarters, which will further enable us to leverage the dramatic growth in AI that is ahead of us. I am confident that this portfolio momentum, combined with our technology capability, manufacturing excellence, financial discipline, and excellent customer relationships, will position us well for the future.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 70% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of McDonald's. View our latest analysis for McDonald's ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.McDonald's already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see McDonald's' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. McDonald's is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.3% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.0% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.6% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of McDonald'sThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of McDonald's Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$388m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 30% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for McDonald's that you should be aware of before investing here.Ultimately the future is most important.

246,f80d3ba0-ec4e-3a12-b678-bb6b93631ad6,NWL,2023-07-01,"Newell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) adds US$352m to market cap in the past 7 days, though investors from five years ago are still down 60%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newell-brands-nasdaq-nwl-adds-121853511.html,1688213933,STORY,['NWL'],"[Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 11% in the last week. But don't envy holders -- looking back over 5 years the returns have been really bad. The share price has failed to impress anyone , down a sizable 68% during that time. So is the recent increase sufficient to restore confidence in the stock? Not yet. But it could be that the fall was overdone.While the last five years has been tough for Newell Brands shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise. So let's look at the longer term fundamentals and see if they've been the driver of the negative returns. Check out our latest analysis for Newell Brands To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Newell Brands moved from a loss to profitability. However, it made a loss in the last twelve months, suggesting profit may be an unreliable metric at this stage. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.Revenue is actually up 0.5% over the time period. So it seems one might have to take closer look at the fundamentals to understand why the share price languishes. After all, there may be an opportunity.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. If you are thinking of buying or selling Newell Brands stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Newell Brands the TSR over the last 5 years was -60%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 16% in the last year, Newell Brands shareholders lost 53% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 10% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Newell Brands has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Newell Brands is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report.

Paccar (PCAR) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.14 a share, just 25 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 25, 2023.PCAR has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.53%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.14 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13.PCAR is part of a big group of Auto-Tires-Trucks stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Ferrari (RACE) as well.Ferrari is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on August 1, 2023. RACE's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.82 a share 32 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ferrari is $1.68, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 8.12%.Story continuesPCAR and RACE's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

UPS, which have consistently hiked dividends, thus highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.Stocks with a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty and stock market volatility. At the same time, they offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have superior fundamentals. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield of more than 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Therefore, if you purchase American Express' shares on or after the 6th of July, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 10th of August.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.60 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.40 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that American Express has a trailing yield of 1.4% on the current share price of $174.2. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for American Express Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. American Express is paying out just 23% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see American Express has grown its earnings rapidly, up 26% a year for the past five years.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, American Express has increased its dividend at approximately 12% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid American Express? Companies like American Express that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings, are usually reinvesting heavily in their business. Perhaps even more importantly - this can sometimes signal management is focused on the long term future of the business. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating American Express more closely.Wondering what the future holds for American Express?

The house prices start from $301,990 for Pulte Homes and $273,990 for Centex.PulteGroup is optimistic about the debut of the Indigo Park and Grand Arbor communities, as it provides homebuyers with exceptional home designs and varied options to choose from. The location of the communities also plays a major role in attracting South Carolina’s homebuyers.PulteGroup’s Focus on First-Time &amp; Move-Up BuyersPulteGroup is witnessing solid demand for homeownership owing to the evolving macro environment. The increase in demand was witnessed in entry-level and move-in homes. Considering the increase in interest rates since 2022, the company molded its business practices to consistently ensure the flow of appropriate inventory of quick move-in homes.In the first quarter of 2023, PHM’s home closings increased 6% year over year to 6,394 homes. This uptrend was backed by the company’s modest increase in its quick move-in homes. First-time buyers also increased 18% to 3,177 homes for the said quarter. PHM’s focus on growing demand for entry-level homes and addressing the need for lower-priced homes, given affordability concerns prevailing in the U.S. housing market ensured its growth. The shift from mix to first-time is in line with the company’s strategy of having more than one-third of business in the first-time buyer space.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the year-to-date period, shares of PulteGroup have risen 69.8%, outperforming the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s growth of 45.9%.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksPulteGroup currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks that investors may consider from the Construction sector are Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.

The current situation of rising rates and persistent inflation are negative for this industry as it is for others. However, market dynamics indicate strong growth prospects in the next few years, as well as in the long term. Therefore, it should figure in your portfolios at this time. Read on to know more: Increasing Homebuilding DemandIt is no secret that we currently have a housing shortage.Just this week, there was some disappointing data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), which said that its pending home sales index dropped 2.7% in May. Moreover, pending transactions were down 22.2% on the year. The NAR’s pending home sales index (base year 2001) measures housing contract activity based on signed real estate contracts for existing single-family homes, condos and co-ops. It is therefore a leading indicator of housing market activity.The main reason for the softness is lack of available inventory, both new and existing. The high interest rates are keeping out existing inventory, although tax incentives may alleviate this situation.While interest rates are also increasing costs for builders, these companies are incentivized by strong demand. As may be expected in any high demand scenario, home prices are increasing again. According to the latest S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, home prices increased for the third straight month in April (the latest data). Prices were up across all of the 20 cities tracked.Government Infrastructure Spending PlanThe Biden administration’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure plan that includes funding for roads and bridges ($110 billion), public transit ($39 billion, including modernization and repairs as well as provisions for the elderly and those with disabilities) broadband internet ($65 billion, includes a $30 a month subsidy to 1 in 4 Americans for high speed access), the electric grid ($108 billion), EVs ($7.5 billion), clean drinking water ($55 billion to change all the piping), airports ($25 billion), etc. Therefore, there’s a whole lot in there to do with construction activity, all of which will greatly increase demand for concrete and aggregates.Story continuesRepair &amp; Remodel in Full SwingThe last 10 years have seen the sale of 5-6 million existing homes each year. An NAR report from last year talks about the average age of homes being 39 years. Obviously, as homes age, they require more repair. Additionally, changing lifestyles require different setups, for which more significant alterations may be required.Rising home prices and higher interest rates are also a deterrent to getting a new house. As a result, people may be more inclined to remodel what they already have. Another factor that plays a role is the kind of buyers. Millennials are more focused on value because their cost of living and student debt among other things leave them less cash to spare. To buy an existing home and remodel it according to their requirements could be an attractive proposition for them. According to JP Morgan’s 2023 Commercial Real Estate Outlook, “E-commerce will likely serve as a tailwind for the logistics industry—and industrial warehouse and distribution properties—for at least 10 years… The industry has begun to respond and deliver record amounts of new warehouses.” The retail space is also likely to see some changes since malls and other locations that thrived from officegoer traffic are struggling to meet their financial commitments. Some cities are repurposing their Grade B and C malls to include restaurants, movie theaters and experiential retail. Manufacturing infrastructure and data center growth are other drivers.Additionally, global economic growth with its focus on infrastructure modernization/sustainability, energy transition and national security, as well as growing urbanization across the world are secular drivers of this industry. These initiatives will require the construction of new buildings, transportation networks, and renewable energy projects, all of which rely on concrete and aggregates.Near-term DynamicsIn the near term, there could be persistent challenges related to the supply chain, which would be negative for material costs as well as transportation and logistics. The higher interest rates are also increasing the cost of borrowings. Additionally, in the current environment, many companies engaged in construction activity are having issues with the availability of raw materials and availability and skill of their labor force. This also slows down consumption of construction materials like concrete and aggregates.Given the positive outlook overall, there are many companies to choose from. I’ve picked four:Eagle Materials Inc. (EXP)Dallas, TX-based Eagle Materials, manufactures and sells heavy construction materials and light building materials in the U.S. Its four operating segments are Cement, Concrete and Aggregates, Gypsum Wallboard, and Recycled Paperboard.Having topped March quarter estimates by 18.7%, Eagle Materials is seeing solid estimate revisions. The current year (ending March 2024) estimate has increased 7.9% in the last 60 days, representing 8.4% growth for the year. The estimate for the following year is up 7.8%, representing 9.4% growth.Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (MLM)Raleigh, NC-based Martin Marietta is a natural resource-based building materials company, supplying crushed stone, sand and gravel products, as well as ready mixed concrete and asphalt; paving products and services; and Portland and specialty cement.Martin Marietta beat estimates by 118.2% in the last quarter. In the last 60 days, there is an 8.4% increase in its 2023 estimate and a 7.5% increase in its 2024 estimate. At the current level, 2023 earnings are expected to grow 33.1% while 2024 earnings are expected to grow 13.9%.Vulcan Materials Company (VMC)Birmingham, AL-based Vulcan produces and supplies construction aggregates primarily in the U.S. It operates through four segments: Aggregates, Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium.The company’s 2023 estimate has increased 11.1% while the 2024 estimate increased 9.7% in the last 60 Days. Analysts are projecting 27.6% earnings growth this year and 18.4% growth in the next. This may well be achievable given the 48.4% earnings beat in the last quarter.Summit Materials, Inc. (SUM)Denver, CO-based Summit is a vertically integrated construction materials company offering aggregates, cement, ready-mix concrete, asphalt paving mixes, and concrete products, as well as plastics components through operating three segments: West, East and Cement.After the solid performance in the last quarter, wherein Summit Materials posted a positive surprise of 31.6%, analysts are incrementally optimistic about this stock. They’ve raised their 2023 estimate 5.0% and their 2024 estimate 6.6%. That means, they expect earnings to grow 16.5% in 2023 and 19.8% in 2024.EXP, MLM and VMC are ranked #1 (Strong Buy) by Zacks. SUM is rated #2 (Buy).One-Month Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:NTAP) Looks Like A Good Stock, And It's Going Ex-Dividend Soon",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netapp-inc-nasdaq-ntap-looks-121009279.html,1688213409,STORY,['NTAP'],"[Readers hoping to buy NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, NetApp investors that purchase the stock on or after the 6th of July will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 26th of July.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.50 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.00 per share. Last year's total dividend payments show that NetApp has a trailing yield of 2.6% on the current share price of $76.4. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether NetApp's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for NetApp Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Fortunately NetApp's payout ratio is modest, at just 34% of profit. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Fortunately, it paid out only 50% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's comforting to see NetApp's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 69% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, NetApp has lifted its dividend by approximately 13% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.To Sum It UpHas NetApp got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? We love that NetApp is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about NetApp, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. To help with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign for NetApp that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

261,e9284866-9325-3847-8c1d-8b975330c57e,NI,2023-07-01,4 Solid Stocks to Bet on in a Resilient Labor Market,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-solid-stocks-bet-resilient-120400324.html,1688126640,STORY,"['PPL', 'NI', 'NIMC', 'INGR', 'LW']","[U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly fell to 239,000 for the week ended Jun 25, reflecting a sharp decline of 26,000 from the prior week and way below analysts’ expectations of 265,000 claims. This was also a 20-month low.At the same time, the U.S. economy has been steadily making job additions almost every month. Needless to say, the U.S. labor market is still resilient, which has been worrying economists as the Fed’s monetary tightening policy has so far not helped much in taming multi-year high inflation.Initial jobless claims have shown signs of increasing over the past month, giving market participants the impression that layoffs are on the rise as the Fed’s steep interest rate hikes have finally made the economy feel the pressure.The Fed has so far raised interest rates by 500 basis points since March 2022 and finally decided to put a pause earlier this month. However, several central bank officials also said that the nation’s economy has been resilient despite 10 straight interest rate hikes.One of the major reasons behind this has been the labor market, which has been holding its ground. The U.S. economy added 339,000 jobs in May. At the same time, the unemployment rate is still below the 4% mark, which means that people still feel their jobs are safe.This has been giving a boost to their confidence. The Conference Board said that consumer confidence jumped to 109.7 in June from May’s reading of 102.5. June’s reading is also the highest since January 2022.This is because people are confident about their jobs and wages. Although wage growth has slowed over the past year, it is still increasing. Average hourly wages in the United States increased 4.3% year over year in May.These factors have been worrying the Fed and they have indicated that at least two more rate hikes of 25 basis points each would be required. This has been unsettling markets as investors are scrambling for direction, which has made markets volatile.Story continuesGiven this situation, investing in defensive stocks that provide risk-adjusted returns like PPL Corporation PPL, NiSource Inc. NI, Ingredion Incorporated INGR and Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. LW is a prudent choice. These stocks belong to the consumer staples and utility sectors, which are considered non-cyclical in nature. This means that their businesses are less affected by market fluctuations. Moreover, these stocks are known for being dividend players, indicating better quality business, which helps them bear market volatility.Also, these are low-beta stocks, meaning their price movements are generally less volatile compared to the broader market. A beta value ranging from 0 to 1 indicates lower instability, providing investors with a perception of reduced risk when compared to the overall market.

With a market capitalization of $5.2 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months were 0.3 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRising skilled services revenues, active pursuit of facility buyouts and a solid cash position continue to drive Ensign Group.The leading healthcare services provider, presently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has a decent track record of beating estimates in one of the trailing four quarters, matching the mark twice and missing the same on the remaining one occasion, the average beat being 0.45%.Can ENSG Retain the Momentum?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ensign Group’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $4.70 per share, indicating a 13.5% increase from the 2022 reported figure. The same for revenues stands at $3.7 billion, suggesting a 22.2% increase from the year-ago figure. It has witnessed two upward estimate revisions compared to none for 2023 earnings over the past 30 days.Improved skilled services revenues from catering to patients under Medicare and Medicaid programs continue to drive Ensign Group’s revenues. Management forecasts revenues within $3.68-$3.73 billion in 2023, the midpoint of which indicates an improvement of 22.5% from the 2022 figure. An aging U.S. population is likely to sustain the solid demand for senior living services provided by ENSG and generate greater revenues, primarily from private pay sources. The dire need for effective rehabilitation services that empower individuals to resume daily life activities is expected to boost service revenues in the days ahead. Ensign Group also makes investments in new business lines, such as ancillary services, in a bid to diversify its revenue base.A growing real estate portfolio is expected to generate higher rental revenues and therefore, contribute to improved earnings in the days ahead. Ensign Group earns rental revenues from leasing the post-acute care properties that it had purchased from healthcare operators under triple-net lease arrangements. Out of its 108 real estate properties, 29 presently fall under the bracket of triple-net long-term leases.Story continuesEnsign Group boasts an active history with regard to skilled nursing and senior living facility acquisitions. Such initiatives build up capabilities, bolster the healthcare portfolio, expand geographical presence and offer ENSG a precise understanding of regional needs by working with a local team of caregivers. This, in turn, enables it to devise healthcare services that fit the needs of different U.S. regions.  Ensign Group currently operates 290 healthcare facilities across 13 U.S. states.A sound financial position provides a cushion for ENSG to pursue uninterrupted growth-related initiatives.

Also, the ongoing investments to improve the resiliency of electric infrastructure against extreme weather conditions and help in the transition to cost-effective, renewable energy sources to produce electricity aid the power industry.Utility companies operating in the United States are taking measures to strengthen their infrastructure, including the process of generation, transmission, distribution, storage and the sale of electricity to customers.The performance of capital-intensive domestic-focused utilities is likely to be adversely impacted by an increase in interest rates as capital servicing costs rise substantially from the current levels. An increase in borrowing costs and a resultant rise in interest expenses are likely to adversely impact the earnings of companies operating in this space.The U.S. electric power sector is gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy to produce electricity. Per a U.S. Energy Information Administration report, the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise 23% in 2023 and 25% in 2024.In this article, we run a comparative analysis on two Zacks Utility— Electric Power companies — DTE Energy Company DTE and PPL Corporation PPL — to decide which one is a better pick for your portfolio.Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.DTE Energy has a market capitalization of $22.5 billion, while PPL has $19.3 billion.Growth ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for DTE’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $6.20 per share on revenues of $16.7 billion. This indicates year-over-year bottom-line growth of 1.6% and a revenue decline of 13.2%.The consensus mark for PPL’s 2023 earnings is pinned at $1.59 per share on revenues of $7.7 billion. This implies year-over-year bottom-line growth of 12.8% and a revenue decline of 2.2%.Story continuesPrice PerformanceIn the past month, DTE Energy’s shares have risen 1.5% compared with the industry's growth of 0.5%. Shares of PPL declined 0.1% in the same time frame. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchReturn on Equity (ROE)ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. The current ROE for DTE Energy and PPL is 10.6% and 7.8%, respectively, compared with the industry’s 4.9%.Debt PositionThe debt-to-capital ratio is a vital indicator of the financial position of a company. It shows the amount of debt used to run a business. Currently, DTE Energy and PPL have a debt-to-capital of 21.5% and 51%, respectively, compared with the industry’s 58.1%.The times interest earned (TIE) ratio for DTE is 2.7, and the same for PPL is 2.6. Since both the companies have a TIE ratio exceeding one, it indicates that they have enough financial flexibility to meet their near-term debt obligations.Dividend YieldUtility companies generally distribute dividends and increase shareholders’ value. Currently, the dividend yield for DTE Energy is 3.49%, and the same for PPL is 3.67%. The dividend yields of these companies are better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 Composite’s average of 1.45%.OutcomeDTE Energy and PPL are evenly matched and good picks for your portfolio.

This was also a 20-month low.At the same time, the U.S. economy has been steadily making job additions almost every month. Needless to say, the U.S. labor market is still resilient, which has been worrying economists as the Fed’s monetary tightening policy has so far not helped much in taming multi-year high inflation.Initial jobless claims have shown signs of increasing over the past month, giving market participants the impression that layoffs are on the rise as the Fed’s steep interest rate hikes have finally made the economy feel the pressure.The Fed has so far raised interest rates by 500 basis points since March 2022 and finally decided to put a pause earlier this month. However, several central bank officials also said that the nation’s economy has been resilient despite 10 straight interest rate hikes.One of the major reasons behind this has been the labor market, which has been holding its ground. The U.S. economy added 339,000 jobs in May. At the same time, the unemployment rate is still below the 4% mark, which means that people still feel their jobs are safe.This has been giving a boost to their confidence. The Conference Board said that consumer confidence jumped to 109.7 in June from May’s reading of 102.5. June’s reading is also the highest since January 2022.This is because people are confident about their jobs and wages. Although wage growth has slowed over the past year, it is still increasing. Average hourly wages in the United States increased 4.3% year over year in May.These factors have been worrying the Fed and they have indicated that at least two more rate hikes of 25 basis points each would be required. This has been unsettling markets as investors are scrambling for direction, which has made markets volatile.Story continuesGiven this situation, investing in defensive stocks that provide risk-adjusted returns like PPL Corporation PPL, NiSource Inc. NI, Ingredion Incorporated INGR and Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. LW is a prudent choice. These stocks belong to the consumer staples and utility sectors, which are considered non-cyclical in nature. This means that their businesses are less affected by market fluctuations. Moreover, these stocks are known for being dividend players, indicating better quality business, which helps them bear market volatility.Also, these are low-beta stocks, meaning their price movements are generally less volatile compared to the broader market. A beta value ranging from 0 to 1 indicates lower instability, providing investors with a perception of reduced risk when compared to the overall market.

265,ca32fedc-a2f5-3eae-900a-fcdf29169b23,TSCO,2023-07-01,What Is Tractor Supply Company's (NASDAQ:TSCO) Share Price Doing?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tractor-supply-companys-nasdaq-tsco-145806547.html,1688137086.0,STORY,['TSCO'],"[Let's talk about the popular Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$250 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$206. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Tractor Supply's current trading price of US$217 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Tractor Supply’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Tractor Supply What's The Opportunity In Tractor Supply?According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 21%, trading at US$217 compared to my intrinsic value of $179.83. This means that the opportunity to buy Tractor Supply at a good price has disappeared! Another thing to keep in mind is that Tractor Supply’s share price is quite stable relative to the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What kind of growth will Tractor Supply generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 25% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Tractor Supply. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? TSCO’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe TSCO should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on TSCO for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for TSCO, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned +0.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, which Occidental falls in, has gained 2.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Occidental is expected to post earnings of $1.07 per share, indicating a change of -66.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.84 points to a change of -48.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -5.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.01 indicates a change of +24.1% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.8%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Occidental.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Occidental, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.28 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -32.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.84 billion and $31.34 billion estimates indicate -19.6% and +5.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $7.26 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -14.9%. EPS of $1.09 for the same period compares with $2.12 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.68%. The EPS surprise was -16.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Omnichannel growth and focus on core priorities have also been working well for this retailer offering cosmetics, fragrance, haircare and skincare products and related services.These upsides have been driving the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company amid high SG&amp;A costs, as witnessed in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein the top and bottom lines increased year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. On its first-quarter earnings call, management stated that while the operating landscape is likely to keep evolving, it remains confident about the resilience of the beauty category.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal-year earnings per share (EPS) has risen by a penny to $25.05 over the past 30 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKey DriversUlta Beauty has been seeing market share gains in major beauty categories for a while now, with skincare standing out, thanks to consumers’ rising interest in self-care and the company’s focus on newness and innovation. The trend continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein skincare was the company’s best-performing category. The company saw double-digit growth in both mass and prestige, mainly due to newness, engaging social media content and solid performance through 21 Days of Beauty and Spring Haul.The company has been focused on its six strategic priorities. The company’s foremost priority is strengthening its omnichannel business and exploring the potential of physical and digital facets. Secondly, the company is undertaking various tools to enhance the experience of guests, like offering a virtual try-on tool and in-store education and reimagining fixtures, among others. Thirdly, the company concentrates on offering customers a curated and exclusive range of beauty products through innovation.Fourthly, the company is focused on deepening customer engagement by boosting rewards and loyalty programs. Fifthly, management is committed to optimizing its cost structure. Sixthly, the company strives to boost organizational talent and strengthen its culture.Ulta Beauty has been enriching its omnichannel experience through launches like Beauty to Go, options like same-day delivery (in some stores) and unique salon services across stores, among others. In fiscal 2022, the company launched its new alliance with Target and has 359 Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shop locations (as of the first quarter of fiscal 2023-end). Apart from this, Ulta Beauty is benefiting from its Wellness Shop launch (in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021), a cross-category platform providing guests self-care for the mind, body and spirit across several stores and online.Story continuesSG&amp;A Costs HighUlta Beauty’s selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses have been rising year over year for a while now. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, SG&amp;A expenses rose 22.2% to $612.1 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses were 23.2%, up from 21.4% reported in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to the deleveraging of store payroll and benefits, corporate overheads and marketing expenses. The operating margin decreased from 18.7% to 16.8%.Management now expects the operating margin to be between 14.5% and 14.8% compared with the previous view of 14.7% and 15%. The revised outlook reflects an increased gross margin deleverage view, which includes the effects of increased shrink and a more competitive and promotional landscape. The company continues to expect SG&amp;A deleverage due to additional expenditures associated with strategic investments and the effects of overall inflation.Wrapping UpThe abovementioned upsides are likely to keep Ulta Beauty well-placed for growth. The company expects fiscal 2023 net sales in the range of $11-$11.1 billion compared with $10.2 billion reported in fiscal 2022. Comparable sales are expected to rise 4-5%.

The contract involves Foreign Military Sales to Bahrain, Chile, Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Taiwan, Thailand and Turkey.Importance of F-16 JetsOver the past decade, a rapid rise in global terrorism and adverse geopolitical situations across borders have boosted the demand for defense products. Combat aircraft constitute a major portion of this portfolio.It is imperative to mention here that the F-16 Falcon jets have significantly risen in importance on a global scale over the past few years.The F-16 has witnessed a significant development in the last couple of years, with nations like Taiwan, Bulgaria, Morocco and Bahrain signing agreements to procure new F-16 aircraft.In order to make the most of this rising demand, Lockheed introduced F-16 Block 70/72 in 2020, the most advanced F-16 aircraft, combining numerous capabilities and structural upgrades.

A PepsiCo spokesperson corrected an earlier statement from an outside company spokesperson) Coca-Cola will only see a limited impact if the world health agency classifies the artificial sweetener used in its Diet Coke, aspartame, as a possible carcinogen, thanks to its scale of production, analysts said on Friday.Such a classification of the popular additive in July by the World Health Organization's cancer research arm could cause consumers, food companies, retailers and restaurants to decide whether to fight back or find alternatives.But for Coca-Cola, whose low-calorie products accounted for a third of its total volumes sold in 2022, analysts said switching to a natural sweetener could be easier than many other companies that use aspartame.""Coca-Cola has one of the best production and distribution systems globally... who have successfully navigated plenty of hurdles in the past, like sugar taxes and reformulations associated with that,"" said Charlie Higgs, an associate partner at Redburn Ltd, a consumer staples research firm.In the past, beverage makers like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have tweaked their ingredient composition to comply with evolving policy changes.The companies had in 2012 altered their manufacturing process of the caramel coloring in their colas to meet the requirements of a California ballot initiative aiming to limit people's exposure to toxic chemicals.Market Analyst Grzegorz Drozdz at investment firm Conotoxia Ltd said the shift from aspartame could hit the short-term profitability of Coca-Cola, but does not see a steep decline in its long-term growth due to its production history.However, PepsiCo could get an edge over its rival as it had moved away from aspartame to a blend of sucralose and acesulfame potassium earlier, CFRA Research said.The company first replaced the additive from some U.S. diet sodas in 2015, but brought it back in some products a year later.(Reporting by Savyata Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)]"

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola is:37% = US$9.9b ÷ US$27b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.37 in profit.Does Coca-Cola Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Coca-Cola has a superior ROE than the average (17%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Coca-Cola visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCoca-Cola's Debt And Its 37% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Coca-Cola, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.63. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Coca-Cola may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

(NYSE:WM), institutional investors have a lot riding on the business",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/82-ownership-waste-management-inc-110021496.html,1688209221,STORY,['WM'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Waste Management's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 24 shareholders own 50% of the companyOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockIf you want to know who really controls Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 82% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$3.2b in market cap last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 13%.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Waste Management. See our latest analysis for Waste Management ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Waste Management?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Waste Management. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Waste Management's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Waste Management. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.2% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.7% and 7.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 24 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Waste ManagementThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Waste Management, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$139m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 17% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Waste Management  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Intuit (INTU) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to INTU for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Intuit's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Intuit's main business drivers.Headquartered in Mountain View, CA, Intuit Inc. is a business and financial software company that develops and sells financial, accounting and tax preparation software and related services for small businesses, consumers and accounting professionals globally. The company has offices in the United States, Canada, India, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Australia, and other locations.In fiscal 2022, Intuit generated total revenues of $12.73 billion. The company has four reportable segments: Small Business and Self-Employed Group, Consumer and Strategic Partner, ProConnect and Credit Karma.Small Business and Self-Employed Group (50.8% of fiscal 2022 revenues) segment serves small businesses and self-employed people around the world, and the accounting professionals who serve and advise them. Intuit’s offerings include QuickBooks financial and business-management online services and desktop software, payroll solutions, merchant payment-processing solutions, and financing for small businesses.Consumer (30.8% of fiscal 2022 revenues) segment offers DIY and assisted TurboTax income-tax preparation products and services. These solutions are sold in the United States and Canada. Intuit’s Mint and Turbo offerings serve consumers and help them understand and improve their financial lives by offering a view of their financial health.ProConnect (4.3% of fiscal 2022 revenues) serves professional accountants in the United States and Canada, who are essential to both small businesses’ success and tax preparation and filing. Intuit’s professional tax offerings include Lacerte, ProSeries, ProFile, and ProConnect Tax Online.Credit Karma (14.2% of fiscal 2022 revenues) segment offers personal finance services including credit cards, personal loans, home and auto loans and insurance.In the Small Business and Self-Employed segment, Intuit competes with companies such as The Sage Group. In payroll, it competes with Automatic Data Processing and Paychex, among others. In the area of merchant services, the company’s rivals are financial institutions like Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America. In the Consumer Segment, Intuit faces intense competition from tax preparation service provider H&amp;R Block.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Intuit ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $7,467.56, or a 646.76% gain, as of June 30, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 173.70% and the price of gold went up 48.68% over the same time frame.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for INTU.Intuit is benefiting from strong momentum in online ecosystem revenues and solid professional tax revenues. The TurboTax Live offering is also driving growth in the Consumer tax business. Solid momentum in the company’s lending product, QuickBooks Capital, remains a positive. Moreover, the company’s strategy of shifting its business to cloud-based subscription model will help generate stable revenues over the long run. We expect Intuit’s revenues to grow at a CAGR of 12.2% through fiscal 2023-2025. Nonetheless, macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds might significantly hurt small businesses operations, thereby posing risks for Intuit’s top-line growth. Additionally, higher costs and expenses due to increased investments in marketing and engineering teams are likely to continue impacting bottom-line results in the near term.The stock is up 7.98% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 10 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The solution has been made available to banks across North America and Europe.Powered by a single API, the Mastercard solution enables consumers to identify and manage their required subscriptions and most importantly, cancels subscriptions that are not required from their bank’s digital apps. The hassles associated with switching between apps while unsubscribing from services are addressed by the solution.In addition to greater control, the recent launch will also enable consumers to take a glance at digital receipts and merchant information, thereby presenting a clear picture of their monthly expenditures and easing the digital financial journey.Apart from being of great use to consumers, the solution will fetch numerous benefits to financial institutions, issuers and merchants as well. The effectiveness of this Mastercard solution is expected to minimize operational expenses for financial institutions while merchants and issuers can get relief from the costs related to disputes and establish strong connections with customers.The latest tie-up with Subaio reflects Mastercard’s sincere efforts to unveil advanced and seamless customer-focused solutions across different parts of the globe. And the well-established subscription management service of Subaio makes it the apt partner to complement MA’s endeavor. In fact, the tech giant extended a helping hand to Subaio by choosing it as a participant in the Mastercard Start Path Program in 2020. Moves similar to the latest one are likely to empower Mastercard in harnessing potential growth prospects of the global subscription economy.  A booming digital era and the emergence of advanced technologies might have triggered the growing inclination of consumers toward utilizing subscription-based products and have led to the current situation wherein they own a significant number of subscriptions.Story continuesIn February 2023, MA rolled out innovative payment solutions backed with the power of Mastercard Payment Gateway Services across Saudi Arabia and empowered the country’s merchants to conduct a diversified array of recurring transactions.  Since recurring payments have to be made at regular intervals, the MA technology-backed solutions automate payments and remove the necessity of payer presence on the website or app.Shares of Mastercard have gained 21.8% in a year compared with the industry’s 8.7% growth.

UDR recently announced the formation of a $510 million joint venture with LaSalle Investment Management, an independent subsidiary of Jones Lang LaSalle JLL. This partnership aims to acquire high-quality communities with operational upside, leveraging UDR's top-tier operating platform.Under the terms of the agreement, UDR will initially contribute four communities totaling 1,328 apartment homes into the joint venture. While retaining 51% ownership in these communities, UDR will receive around $250 million in cash proceeds. The venture is designed to be debt-free initially, and the company anticipates that it will be accretive to funds from operations (FFO) as adjusted and cash flow per share within the first year.The communities selected for the seed portfolio, diversified across geography, age and price point, present multiple value-add opportunities. UDR will serve as the venture's manager, earning various management fees, including asset, property, financing and construction management fees. For any new acquisitions, UDR will earn acquisition fees and there is also a potential to earn a promoted return if certain return hurdles are met.This joint venture is a testament to the effectiveness of UDR’s operating platform, innovation and unique value-creation mechanisms, and it further amplifies its strategy of diversifying capital sources that enable the execution of accretive investment opportunities across economic and market cycles. It sets the stage for UDR to increase its operating scale, densify and achieve earnings accretion.The joint venture is expected to further fuel the company's growth trajectory. The cash proceeds from the venture can be used to strengthen UDR's balance sheet, fund capital expenditures, or repurchase shares, thereby enhancing shareholder value. It also positions UDR to capture opportunities in high-quality communities and enhance FFO per share growth. The joint venture could potentially contribute to UDR's capacity to sustain or even increase its dividend, enhancing its appeal to income-focused investors.Currently, UDR carries a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

The stored water will help alleviate water needs during future dry periods without rain and will reduce future reliance on the Carmel River and Seaside Basin.Of the 182-day Aquifer Storage and Recovery season, California American Water successfully injected water 157 days when river triggers were met, making this the 2nd highest ASR injection season since the ASR program began. Flows on the Carmel River must reach certain thresholds to activate the ability to capture excess flows during the ASR season which runs from December 1st through May 31st.""With the last couple years of drought, we rarely received enough rain to reach the state mandated threshold to implement our ASR program, but we were more than prepared to act when the time came,"" said Chris Cook, Central California Director of Operations.

This commitment helps ensure service reliability and water quality to help protect customers and the communities we serve,"" said Kathryn Nash, president of Kentucky American Water. ""We also remain steadfast in addressing the needs of our most vulnerable customers by including components in our request to keep rates affordable.""In today’s filing, Kentucky American Water is seeking to increase water service revenues by $26 million, net of Qualified Infrastructure Program (QIP) revenues. The PSC approved the company’s QIP in 2019. The program enables the company to replace aging water system infrastructure more quickly. If the company’s proposed rates are approved as requested, the bill for a typical residential customer using 3,800 gallons per month would increase by approximately $9.00 per month when new rates are implemented in 2024. The company last filed for new rates through a general rate case in November 2018 and last implemented new base rates in June 2019.Additional information on current rates is available on the company’s website at https://www.amwater.com/kyaw/Customer-Service-Billing/your-water-rates.Results of a customer affordability study conducted as part of the filing demonstrate that the cost of the company’s water service as a comparison of monthly bills to monthly household income has improved over the past decade and will remain affordable under the company’s proposed rates.Story continuesRecognizing that affordability may still be an issue for some residential customers, the company is proposing a new rate design that provides a reduced monthly service charge and consumption charges rate. The new rate design, if approved by the PSC, would be available to qualified residential customers.Additionally, Kentucky American Water offers payment plans, budget billing and, for income-eligible customers, the company’s H2O Help to Others customer assistance program.

This initiative is part of the company's commitment to extending the service life of these overhead structures and enhancing water quality for residents.The rehabilitation process includes several essential steps aimed at preserving the integrity and functionality of the water tanks. After draining water, the tanks are subjected to sandblasting to remove debris and surface imperfections. The final phase involves repainting to protect the tanks from corrosion and external factors.Tennessee American Water has been actively involved in rehabilitating water tanks since 2016. To date, it has successfully completed 12 tank rehabilitations, with ongoing work on a second tank at the Chattanooga plant and two tanks on Lookout Mountain, TN, in 2023. The costs associated with tank rehabilitation range from $300,000 up to $2 million, forming part of Tennessee American Water's annual capital work.By extending the service life of these vital assets and ensuring water quality, the company is actively contributing to the improvement of water infrastructure. Timely upgrades and repairs are essential for maintaining efficient water systems, and Tennessee American Water sets a commendable example in this regard.Investments Essential for Water IndustryAging water and wastewater infrastructure is a major headwind for the water industry. It is evident from the findings of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) that due to the delay in pipeline repairs and maintenance, 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost every day in the United States. Delays in the repair and maintenance of the infrastructure could aggravate the problem.Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, investments of $473 billion and $271 billion are necessary to maintain and expand drinking water and wastewater pipelines, respectively, to meet demand over the next 20 years. Water infrastructure like storage tanks and purifying units, as well as miles of water mains, need maintenance at proper intervals.American Water Works is making regular investments to maintain its infrastructure. It aims to invest in the range of $14-$15 billion in the 2023-2027 period and $30-$34 billion for 10 years from 2023-2032. Last week, Pennsylvania American Water decided to invest $17.5 million in 2023 to upgrade and maintain eight of its water storage tanks and construct five new tanks to cater to the rising demand for water.Water utilities like Essential Utilities WTRG, California Water Service Group CWT and Middlesex Water MSEX have well-chalked-out capital investment plans to strengthen their infrastructure.Essential Utilities plans to invest $1.1 billion in 2023 and $3.3 billion through 2025 to improve the water and natural gas systems and better serve customers using improved information technology. California Water Service plans to invest more than $725 million in capital expenditures through 2024. Middlesex Water plans to invest $266 million during 2023-2025 to strengthen its water and wastewater infrastructure and provide services to customers in a safe, reliable and efficient manner.The above investments might appear very small compared with the total requirements needed for repair and upgrades but are undeniably a positive move to address the aging water and wastewater infrastructure.Story continuesPrice PerformanceShares of AWK have lost 4.1% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s 3.8% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankAmerican Water Works currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. That's why when we briefly looked at PepsiCo's (NASDAQ:PEP) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for PepsiCo, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$12b ÷ (US$93b - US$26b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, PepsiCo has an ROCE of 18%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Beverage industry average of 15% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for PepsiCo roceIn the above chart we have measured PepsiCo's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is PepsiCo's ROCE Trending?The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 18% and the business has deployed 20% more capital into its operations. 18% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that PepsiCo has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From PepsiCo's ROCEIn the end, PepsiCo has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.One final note, you should learn about the   4 warning signs  we've spotted with PepsiCo (including 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) .While PepsiCo may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

A PepsiCo spokesperson corrected an earlier statement from an outside company spokesperson) Coca-Cola will only see a limited impact if the world health agency classifies the artificial sweetener used in its Diet Coke, aspartame, as a possible carcinogen, thanks to its scale of production, analysts said on Friday.Such a classification of the popular additive in July by the World Health Organization's cancer research arm could cause consumers, food companies, retailers and restaurants to decide whether to fight back or find alternatives.But for Coca-Cola, whose low-calorie products accounted for a third of its total volumes sold in 2022, analysts said switching to a natural sweetener could be easier than many other companies that use aspartame.""Coca-Cola has one of the best production and distribution systems globally... who have successfully navigated plenty of hurdles in the past, like sugar taxes and reformulations associated with that,"" said Charlie Higgs, an associate partner at Redburn Ltd, a consumer staples research firm.In the past, beverage makers like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have tweaked their ingredient composition to comply with evolving policy changes.The companies had in 2012 altered their manufacturing process of the caramel coloring in their colas to meet the requirements of a California ballot initiative aiming to limit people's exposure to toxic chemicals.Market Analyst Grzegorz Drozdz at investment firm Conotoxia Ltd said the shift from aspartame could hit the short-term profitability of Coca-Cola, but does not see a steep decline in its long-term growth due to its production history.However, PepsiCo could get an edge over its rival as it had moved away from aspartame to a blend of sucralose and acesulfame potassium earlier, CFRA Research said.The company first replaced the additive from some U.S. diet sodas in 2015, but brought it back in some products a year later.(Reporting by Savyata Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)]"

Fuller won the prestigious award for her accomplishments on and off the field, joining an impressive group of former Gatorade National Girls Soccer Players of the Year who have combined for more than 17 gold medals and nine National Championships.Chicago Red Stars forward Mallory Swanson virtually surprised Fuller with the news, while her family, coaches and teammates showed up with the trophy at school.

Eskilson, National Analyst for PrepSocccer.com. ""In the two decades I've been scouting elite youth players, there are only a handful of players who I would consider to be her peer or her equal—both in terms of ability at her age as well as projected ceiling. Fuller is the full-package: Dynamic, driven and detail-oriented. A determined student of the game, she used her second season in high school to one-up her incredible debut campaign, producing one dominant display after another. She was surrounded by some of the best talent in the country this year and she shined, but she also made everyone around her better. An escape artist on the dribble, a magician with her passing and a scoring threat from anywhere on the field, Kennedy Fuller is 'Showtime' on a soccer pitch.""Story continuesThe state's returning Gatorade Player of the Year, the 5-foot-5 sophomore midfielder scored 55 goals and passed for 26 assists this past season, leading the Dragons (26-1) to the Conference 6A state championship game.

""It's a testament to Kennedy's hard work and incredible achievements that have outshined the competition not just in her state, but the whole nation.""Each year, a selection committee evaluates the nation's top talent to choose one state winner from each of the 50 states as well as Washington D.C., in 12 different sports: football, girls volleyball, boys and girls cross country, boys and girls basketball, baseball, softball, boys and girls soccer, and boys and girls track &amp; field.
