(NASDAQ:VRSK) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Verisk Analytics Verisk Analytics Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Christopher Foskett, sold US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$180 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$227). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 25% of Christopher Foskett's stake.In total, Verisk Analytics insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Verisk Analytics better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Verisk Analytics Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen a bit of insider selling at Verisk Analytics. US$245k worth of shares were sold by Independent Chairman Bruce Hansen. But US$218k was spent on buying, too, (as we mentioned above) . While it's not great to see insider selling, the net amount sold isn't enough for us to want to read anything into it.Story continuesDoes Verisk Analytics Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Verisk Analytics insiders own 0.7% of the company, worth about US$216m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Verisk Analytics Tell Us?Our data shows a little more insider selling than buying in the last three months. But the net divestment is not enough to concern us at all. While we gain confidence from high insider ownership of Verisk Analytics, we can't say the same about their transactions in the last year, in the absence of further purchases. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Verisk Analytics you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

2,cbf66497-0aea-3790-b709-039cedda805b,SCHW,2023-07-12,Is Schwab Fundamental International Small Company Index (SFILX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-fundamental-international-small-company-110006648.html,1689159606,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Have you been searching for a Mutual Fund Equity Report fund? You might want to begin with Schwab Fundamental International Small Company Index (SFILX). The fund does not have a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank, though we have been able to explore other metrics like performance, volatility, and cost.History of Fund/ManagerSFILX finds itself in the Schwab Funds family, based out of San Francisco, CA. Schwab Fundamental International Small Company Index made its debut in January of 2008, and since then, SFILX has accumulated about $530.18 million in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. The fund is currently managed by a team of investment professionals.PerformanceOf course, investors look for strong performance in funds. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 0.35%, and it sits in the bottom third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3 -year annualized total return of 7.73%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Compared to the category average of 19.71%, the standard deviation of SFILX over the past three years is 18.58%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 19.73% compared to the category average of 21.26%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsWith a 5-year beta of 0.92, the fund is likely to be less volatile than the market average. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&amp;P 500. Over the past 5 years, the fund has a negative alpha of -8.72. This means that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, SFILX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.39% compared to the category average of 1.13%. From a cost perspective, SFILX is actually cheaper than its peers.This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $0, while there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.Bottom LineWant even more information about SFILX?

However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexManaged by Charles Schwab, FNDB has amassed assets over $512.96 million, making it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - All Cap Value. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Index.The Russell RAFI US Index measures the performance of the constituent companies by fundamental overall company scores.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.25% for this ETF, which makes it one of the cheaper products in the space.Story continuesIt's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 1.91%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 18.10% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector; Financials and Industrials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 4.15% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (BRKB).FNDB's top 10 holdings account for about 18.66% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the Schwab Fundamental U.S. Broad Market Index ETF return is roughly 9.27% so far, and is up about 14.73% over the last 12 months (as of 07/12/2023). FNDB has traded between $47.13 and $56.98 in this past 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 1.02 and standard deviation of 17.57% for the trailing three-year period, which makes FNDB a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 1738 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Broad Market Index ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - All Cap Value segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.Dimensional U.S. Targeted Value ETF (DFAT) tracks ---------------------------------------- and the iShares Core S&amp;P U.S. Value ETF (IUSV) tracks S&amp;P 900 Value Index.

It has amassed assets over $33.48 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendCompanies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.03%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.47%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund.

Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index.

6,f3a7fa00-6e88-3af0-80bc-d20dec7bd11c,SCHW,2023-07-12,Analysts Estimate The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-charles-schwab-corporation-140024602.html,1689084024,STORY,['SCHW'],"[The market expects The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 18. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -22.7%.Revenues are expected to be $4.61 billion, down 9.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.77% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The Charles Schwab Corporation?For The Charles Schwab Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.28%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The Charles Schwab Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The Charles Schwab Corporation would post earnings of $0.90 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.93, delivering a surprise of +3.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.The Charles Schwab Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: BlackRock, Inc BLK, The Charles Schwab Corporation SCHW, Hut 8 Mining HUT, Riot Platforms, Inc. RIOT and Cleanspark CLSK.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Bitcoin Mining Stocks Outdo BTC in H1: Will the Trend Last?For most of this year, driven by the heightened demand for Bitcoin (BTC), miners have gained immensely due to an increase in transaction fees that boosted their bottom lines.Prominent Bitcoin mining companies saw their shares outpace the price of the world's most valuable coin by a huge margin in the first half of 2023.The difference in the price performance between Bitcoin mining firms and Bitcoin is primarily because of the leveraged beta effect. This means mining stocks tend to perform even better when Bitcoin prices are moving northward. On the other hand, mining stocks underperform when spot Bitcoin price declines.Now, the question is, can Bitcoin mining stocks also post higher gains in the second half? After all, an interest rate hike in July is already priced in, and further rate hikes are in the cards. Needless to say, higher rates do weigh heavily on high-risk assets such as digital coins.Expect More Interest Rate HikesJob additions in the month of June remained robust, with strong wage growth and the jobless rate near historic lows. This means a solid labor market will continue to fuel demand in the economy.However, the Federal Reserve is trying to slow down the pace of economic growth through rate hikes. And with inflation still running above the Fed's target of 2%, the central bank is expected to remain aggressive in its monetary policy.Fears of Higher Rates Drag Down the Price of Bitcoin A resilient labor market driving rate hike expectations dragged the price of Bitcoin lower on Jul 7. Over the past 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin dropped 1% to $30,250 and traded just above the psychologically vital $30,000 level.Story continuesLest we forget, that at one point of time last week, the price of Bitcoin had breezed past the $31,000 level. Also, the price of Bitcoin had posted its best first half a year since 2019 (read more: 3 Crypto Stocks On a Roll as Bitcoin Tops $31,000).Bitcoin to Hold the $30000 Support Level &amp; Gather StrengthEven though the price of Bitcoin gave away some of its gains last week, it was able to hold the $30,000 level as support. In reality, market pundits expect this decline to be a short-term correction. But in the long run, the price of Bitcoin is well-poised to scale upward.This is because large financial institutes, at the moment, are showing keen interest in Bitcoin. BlackRock, Inc has requested regulators to launch a Bitcoin ETF, which will in due course lead to more retail participation. Simultaneously, The Charles Schwab Corporation is backing a new crypto exchange called EDX Markets. This exchange will allow the trading of Bitcoin.Good Times Ahead for Bitcoin Mining CompaniesWith the price of Bitcoin expected to shrug off this temporary dip, and finally gain strength, Bitcoin mining stocks are positioned to scale upward. Mining companies, meanwhile, have made expansion moves, indicating long-term strength in the industry. They are increasing their hash rate, and positioning themselves to buy more machines in the long run.Hut 8 Mining has recently merged with US Bitcoin Corp to increase its total hash rate substantially. It aims to increase its total hash rate to 9.8 EH/s. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 50%.Similarly, to improve its hash rate capacity, Riot Platforms, Inc. recently agreed with mining hardware manufacturer MicroBT. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's expected earnings growth rate for next year is 20.8%. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Cleanspark is another company that invested heavily to increase its hash rate by nearly 1 EH/s. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company's expected earnings growth rate for the next year is 52.6%. Thus, it can be safely concluded that there's a lot more upside to come for Bitcoin mining companies.Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.com                        https://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

9,5e5aee60-e34c-38bf-82d8-a0d61ff4bad5,TXN,2023-07-12,3 Semiconductor Stocks to Sell in July,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-semiconductor-stocks-sell-july-223045121.html,1688596245,STORY,"['INTC', 'TXN', 'MU']","[As we traverse through a tumultuous 2023, the semiconductor market is facing a confluence of challenges which beckons the question of semiconductor stocks to sell.Gartner’s projections point to an 11.2% decline in global semiconductor revenue in 2023, a downturn fueled by multiple economic, technological, and geopolitical factors. Economic headwinds are shifting end-market electronics demand from consumers to businesses, and an oversupply of chips is weighing down inventories and chip prices. Further, the memory industry is feeling the pinch, expecting a 35.5% revenue drop in 2023 due to overcapacity and surplus inventory.With these factors in mind, the case for avoiding semiconductor stocks grows stronger. The semiconductor stock risks are palpable, and understanding them is critical for prudent investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIntel (INTC)Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.Source: ShutterstockIn an audacious move to reposition itself against the stalwarts in the semiconductor space, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is burning through cash at an alarming pace. To fuel this daring play, it announced a whopping $33 billion for two new chip fabrication plants in Germany.However, it left investors puzzled, with heavy spending coming hot on the heels of Intel’s record-breaking net loss in May. Not long ago, Intel slashed its annual payout from $1.46 per share to a modest $0.50 per share due to its negative cash flow in 2022.The road to recovery is proving to be a bumpy ride for Intel shareholders. The company’s stock continues to trade in the red. Moreover, its top-line and EBITDA growth are at a negative 27% and 68.7%, respectively. Also, its free cash flow margins have tanked more than 18% during the same period.Micron Technology (MU)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is another semiconductor player trying to navigate the stormy seas in its niche. With its top and bottom-line growth in the doldrums due to a myriad of challenges discussed earlier, it grapples with another daunting challenge.Story continuesAmidst the geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, roughly 50% of the sales generated from China are at potential risk. In an attempt to pivot, Micron might direct its products to other markets. However, an oversupply could ignite a price depression on a global scale.Amid this uncertainty, Micron forecasts a modest uptick in the fourth quarter. Its revenue is expected to touch $3.9 billion, a marginal improvement over the prior-year period. Gross margins, too, anticipate a leap to -10.5%. Despite the company’s optimism about recovering in the second half of the year, these projections fall short of long-term potential. As the company treads this rocky path, its journey to recovery remains uncertain.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is one of the top players in the semiconductor industry, consistently charting a path toward organic growth and shareholder return. This strategy has yielded strong gross profit and EBITDA margins over the past decade allowing the firm to solidify its position in its sector.However, the firm is witnessing a late contraction in free cash flow margins as it operates in a highly unconducive market. Factors such as a sales slowdown, swelling inventory, and elevated capital expenditures have throttled free cash flow generation. With a substantial capex target of $5 billion annually for the next three years, the company’s cash reserves could take a major hit. Additionally, the inventory’s increasing grip on cash conversion is a concern, with its days in inventory value worst than almost 60% of its peers. On top of that, its debt-to-equity ratio is worse than 78% of its peers now. Hence, the road ahead seems laden with financial hurdles for Texas Instruments.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing GuidelinesMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

10,1a27735a-e390-3f2f-927b-7ad0a220f38c,NUE,2023-07-12,Is Trending Stock Nucor Corporation (NUE) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-nucor-corporation-nue-130006059.html,1689080406,STORY,['NUE'],"[Nucor (NUE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this steel company have returned +10.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Steel - Producers industry, which Nucor falls in, has gained 7.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nucor is expected to post earnings of $5.54 per share, indicating a change of -42.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.42 points to a change of -36% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +4.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.09 indicates a change of -34.3% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nucor.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Nucor, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $9.76 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -17.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $36.04 billion and $32.88 billion estimates indicate -13.2% and -8.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $8.71 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -17%. EPS of $4.45 for the same period compares with $7.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.45%. The EPS surprise was +16.8%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

How much is it costing them?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/banks-are-fighting-to-keep-deposits-how-much-is-it-costing-them-110301151.html,1689159781,STORY,"['BAC', 'USB', 'PPC', 'WFC', 'CMA', 'STT', 'STT-PD', 'STT-PG', 'FBAKX', 'MS', 'CFG', 'CFG-PD', 'CFG-PE', 'JPM', 'HBAN', 'HBANL', 'HBANM', 'HBANP', 'C', 'ZION', 'KEY', 'MIMTF', 'GS']","[Bank deposit rates are the highest in a decade and a half. That’s good news for savers, but bad news for lenders as they prepare to release their second-quarter results.US banks spent the last several months competing with each other to keep or bring back depositors following the turmoil that took down three sizable regional institutions and triggered outflows across the banking system.That scramble pushed rates on savings accounts to 5.05% at the end of the second quarter, according to Bankrate, their steepest level since February 2008.Read more: The best high-yield savings account rates for July 2023The challenge for banks across the US is that these higher funding costs are eating into a key measure of profitability known as net interest margin, which measures the difference between what lenders make from their loans and what they pay for their deposits.That will likely act as a drag on results for some banks in the quarter, especially the mid-sized regional institutions that ran into trouble last spring, while reducing estimates of what they can earn for the rest of the year.“The surprises this quarter will be for the banks that do not lower expectations,” Wells Fargo bank analyst Mike Mayo told Yahoo Finance.Banks, added Argus Research's Stephen Biggar, ""have a deposit conundrum.""'Green shoots'?These pressures will be at the front of mind for investors starting Friday as they digest the first set of second quarter earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and State Street (STT).Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report next Tuesday and Goldman Sachs (GS) next Wednesday. A slew of other regional banks will also report in the coming weeks.Some of the biggest US banks are expected to once again demonstrate their resilience and diversity, showing they can continue to charge more for their loans while leaning on their sprawling franchises to generate additional revenue.Story continuesJPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America are all expected to show jumps in net income when compared to the year-earlier period, according to analyst estimates, while Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley are expected to report profit declines.JPMorgan's headquarters in New York City. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)Those that are more dependent on investment banking, such as Goldman, are expected to be particularly challenged by a recent drought in deal making.Global investment banking revenues for the second quarter fell by 8% from the first quarter and 52% from a year ago, according to Dealogic. However, the business improved through the second half of the quarter, prompting some observers to predict “green shoots” ahead.“I’m turning to believing investment banking will not have great earnings but they’re going to be surprising, and I think better than expected,” said Dick Bove, a bank analyst with Odeon Capital.Investors will also be watching to see whether many of these big banks increase the amounts they set aside for future loan losses, a sign that they expect the US economy and credit conditions to worsen.“We're starting to see some increased delinquencies, particularly in the credit card and auto lending market,” said Biggar, Argus Research's director of financial services.'A huge amount of problems'Smaller regional banks are clearly not under the same amount of pressure as they were in March, when the fall of Silicon Valley Bank triggered panic across the country.But they still “face a huge amount of problems,” Bove said.The core issue is an aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to bring down inflation with higher interest rates. That campaign is lowering the value of the assets banks hold, such as bonds, while deposit costs creep higher and loan demand slows.Read more: Why now is a good time to open a savings account“We view accelerating deposit costs, not accelerating deposit outflows, as the most significant headwind to earnings for the next several quarters,“ Manan Gosalia, a regional bank analyst for Morgan Stanley, said in a research note.Higher rates have traditionally worked to the advantage of banks since it allows them to charge more for their loans than their deposits.But the panic of the spring “has changed the calculus a bit” for some banks, the Fed’s vice chair of supervision Michael Barr said Monday. Some lenders “are now paying up more for deposits,” and the Fed is “paying careful attention to that.”Silicon Valley Bank was seized on March 10. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)The Fed has made it clear that more hikes are coming this year. Regulators are also preparing new capital requirements for banks with more than $100 billion in assets that will force some to hold greater buffers against losses. That will increase the stability of those lenders but will also make it even more difficult to earn robust profits in the near term.Many banks have already warned at a conference in June that their net interest margins are going to drop by more than they expected for the quarter or the year, including executives for US Bancorp (USB), Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Comerica (CMA), Huntington (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), and Zions (ZION).“I’ve only been a banker for 10 years, so I haven’t seen a time when we’ve needed deposits as an industry as much as we do now,” Darrin Williams, the CEO of the 58-branch Southern Bancorp, told Yahoo Finance.The amount Southern Bancorp is paying customers has risen 600% since the Fed’s interest rate hiking cycle began, Williams added.“Our cost of funds continues to rise just because our customers demand that.”The larger banks aren’t immune to some of these same challenges.“Deposits will continue the trend of being slightly down from here,” Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase's massive consumer and community bank, said at a conference in June.The bank has predicted it will earn net interest income of $84 billion in 2023, but if the deposit pressure keeps up, that figure could experience a “mild reprice,” she said.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

14,00250889-8b28-33d1-902a-52f07209b533,STT,2023-07-12,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pnc-financial-services-group-inc-140020446.html,1689084020,STORY,"['PNC', 'STT']","[The market expects The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 18. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.1%.Revenues are expected to be $5.43 billion, up 6.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.75% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc?For The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.41%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc would post earnings of $3.60 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.98, delivering a surprise of +10.56%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, State Street Corporation (STT), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.08 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +7.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.12 billion, up 5.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for State Street Corporation has been revised 1.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.25%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that State Street Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

One such stock is First United Corporation FUNC.This Oakland, MD-based bank offers a range of services, such as commercial and retail banking facilities, trust services and wealth management services through 26 branches across the country.First United has been increasing its quarterly dividend on a regular basis, with the last hike of 11.1% to 20 cents per share announced in March 2023. Over the past five years, the company increased its dividend four times, with an annualized dividend growth rate of 21.04%.Considering the last day’s closing price of $13.86, First United’s dividend yield currently stands at 5.77%. This is impressive compared with the industry average of 3.26% and attractive for income investors as it represents a steady income stream.First United Corporation Dividend Yield (TTM)First United Corporation Dividend Yield (TTM)First United Corporation dividend-yield-ttm | First United Corporation QuoteAdditionally, on Jun 28, the company announced a cash dividend of 20 cents per share. The dividend will be paid on Aug 1 to shareholders of record as of Jul 18.Should you keep an eye on First United’s stock to earn a high dividend yield? Let’s check out the company fundamentals to understand the risks and rewards. This will help us make a proper investment decision.FUNC is witnessing a steady improvement in revenues, which recorded a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2% over the last three years (2019-2022). The uptrend continued in the first quarter of 2023. The improvement was backed by a strong loan and deposit balance and higher interest rates.While its revenues are expected to improve marginally this year, the same is expected to fall 1.9% in 2024.First United remains focused on bolstering its loan and deposit balance. Over the last three years (ended 2022), loans and deposits recorded a CAGR of 6.7% and 11.2%, respectively. Driven by modest loan demand and high rates, the company is expected to witness an uptrend in loans and deposit balances going forward.First United’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) indicates its growth potential. Its ROE of 16.65% compares favorably with the 12.24% for the industry. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholder funds.Despite near-term headwinds that include rising expenses and a tough operating environment, FUNC is fundamentally solid.

23,387fabf2-fba7-33ca-9840-9c27d703bfb0,CF,2023-07-12,Safety First: 3 Dividend Stocks for Investors Seeking Stability,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/safety-first-3-dividend-stocks-193439227.html,1688585679,STORY,"['KR', 'VLO', 'CF']","[With the most recent read on inflation seemingly suggesting a trajectory of disinflation, the very concept of dividend stocks for stability seems overly cautious. Fundamentally, I would gently suggest a rethink of this framework. Because so-called safe dividend investments provide passive income, they’re relevant in any market cycle.However, the specific concept of safety first investing isn’t as ridiculous as it might appear. Sure, inflation may have ticked down from analysts’ expectations. Nevertheless, consumer prices remain exceptionally elevated against pre-pandemic norms. Also, the underlying economy might not be as robust as you think, adding weight to stable dividend stocks.As the May jobs report pointed out, while the economy added 339,000 jobs (well above expectations), the unemployment rate ticked higher. Also, the average length of the workweek and the pace of wage growth declined. With resiliency lacking a holistic element, dividend stocks for stability make plenty of sense.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKroger (KR)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comAs a retail giant operating supermarkets and multi-department stores, Kroger (NYSE:KR) effectively sells itself as one of the dividend stocks for stability. No matter what’s going on in the economy, people need nutritional sustenance to survive and thrive. While it’s not particularly exciting – with KR stock gaining just under 7% since the start of the year – the business itself is permanently relevant.On the financial side, Kroger might not have the most bulletproof balance sheet, I must say. Nevertheless, it rings true operationally, featuring a three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 10.3%, beating out 70% of its peers. Also, as you might expect, Kroger features a consistently profitable enterprise.Regarding its case as one of the stable dividend stocks, Kroger carries a forward yield of 2.45%. While modest, it’s noticeably above the consumer staples sector’s average yield of 1.89%. In addition, the payout ratio sits at a lowly 25.51%, providing confidence for yield sustainability. With 17 years of consecutive dividend increases, it’s a status management that won’t give up cheaply.Story continuesCF Industries (CF)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA manufacturer and distributor of agricultural fertilizers, including ammonia, urea, and ammonium nitrate products, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) plays a major role in the global food supply chain equation. Unfortunately, the business itself suffers from the conflict in Eastern Europe, which has impacted global fertilizer supply. While I still contend that CF ranks among dividend stocks for stability based on the core relevant narrative, the acute conflict-related headwind poses challenges.For example, since the start of the year, CF slipped 14%. Over the trailing one-year period, the security gave up almost 16% of its equity value. That’s not the kind of performance one would normally associate with safe dividend investments, I’ll freely admit. At the same time, forward-thinking contrarians might see an opportunity here. For example, CF trades at a forward multiple of 7.72, below the underlying sector median of 9.37. Also, the company overall benefits from strong long-term revenue growth and robust profitability metrics.As for being one of the dividend stocks for stability, CF features a forward yield of 2.27%, which is modest. However, with a payout ratio of 22.59%, CF stakeholders can rest assured of their passive income.Valero Energy (VLO)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAs a downstream petroleum company, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) might seem an odd idea if you’re looking for safety first investing. Basically, the hydrocarbon energy market suffered significant headwinds in large part because of rising borrowing costs. With many countries’ central banks adopting a hawkish monetary policy in an effort to curb inflation, Valero hasn’t exactly enjoyed a stellar performance.To be sure, since the Jan. opener, VLO gave up a bit more than 2% of its equity value. Still, I think there’s some potential here as one of the high-yield stable stocks. Over the trailing one-year period, VLO gained over 13%. Fundamentally, the gradual return to full normalization should increase traffic volume to pre-pandemic levels. That alone would likely dramatically benefit Valero’s downstream business by expanding the addressable market.As for passive income, Valero carries a forward yield of 3.47%, which is a bit lower than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. However, its payout ratio sits at 30.88%, offering confidence regarding yield sustainability. Overall, the potential for rising relevance makes VLO one of the top dividend stocks for stability.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

We encourage the public to show their support for them by voting for their favorites now through August 11.""The top 10 finalists in the 2023 America’s Best Restroom contest include (in alphabetical order):Baltimore/Washington International (BWI) Thurgood Marshall Airport (Baltimore, Maryland): The newly constructed restrooms at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport maximize occupant capacity while enhancing the overall passenger experience. The entrance welcomes travelers with an aesthetic mural and seating area while they wait for their companions. The new restrooms feature bright, spacious, fully enclosed stalls for privacy, touchless fixtures and individual lactation, adult changing and family assist rooms. Each restroom features a state-of-the-art smart restroom system that integrates with color-changing, LED stall occupancy lights and digital signage at the restroom entrances showing current availability. The smart restroom system also provides real-time inventory tracking and usage counts for custodial services.Clear Lake and Des Moines River Safety Rest Areas (Jackson, Minnesota): The Minnesota Department of Transportation Safety Rest Areas (SRAs) provides two new SRAs, paired to serve eastbound and westbound travelers, on I-90 near Jackson, Minnesota. Open 24 hours to the traveling public, the SRAs share a similar design language that focuses on cleanliness, durability, safety and inclusion, as well as strives to exceed the users’ expectations. The multi-user restrooms are designed without doors at their entries to allow for an increased sense of safety for users and to eliminate pathogen transfer. Dual restrooms for each gender enable access to one pair during cleaning. Family restrooms are designed to meet the needs of families, adults with special needs and users desiring gender-neutral facilities. Entrances to the multi-user restrooms are enhanced by large photographic murals illustrating detailed views of the prairie landscape by a well-known local photographer.Drusie &amp; Darr (Nashville, Tennessee): A show-stopping punctuation mark on the redesign of the two restaurants is a new ladies’ room, a counterpoint to the hotel’s famous 1930s-era Art Deco men’s room – for years one of Nashville’s most photographed spots. Taking its cue from the men’s room’s striped tilework in lime green and black, the new ladies’ room is lavishly decorated with striped walls and floors of variegated pink marble, arched doorways, rose gold-framed mirrors, pink fixtures and glamorous lighting throughout, making it a stunning surprise that is equally as photo-worthy.El Rio (San Francisco, California): Inclusive dive bar and San Francisco Legacy Business El Rio continues to elevate equity and access for all with two new dazzling restrooms: one ADA accessible and an adjacent two-stall stunner. Evoking a futuristic Tokyo-bound subway, they feature brightly colored and patterned tile and paint, backlit mirrors -- including a full-length version with multiple lighting options -- and sleek and modern sinks and fixtures. Brought to life by the genius of Principal Maryam Rostami and Associate Kate Thorson of TEF Design, the project is a true grassroots collaboration made possible by community contributions.Frying Pan (New York, New York): Built in 1929, the Lightship ""Frying Pan"" is listed on both the New York State and Federal Register of Historic Places, as it is one of 13 lightships remaining from the more than 100 built. The ship’s nautical themed restroom is decked out in rivetted sheet metal and warm wood. Coastal light fixtures are mounted in each stall and above the large sink vessels. Hand painted artwork of the historic ship adds a nostalgic touch.Hell ‘n Blazes Brewing Company (Melbourne, Florida): Don DiFrisco purchased a 120+ year old former hardware store and bank with the wild idea of renovating it and converting it into a fine craft brewery serving great gastropub food and craft cocktails. He wanted there to be no ""waiting lines"" for the ladies’ room as are common in many similar venues, so they undertook a plan that included numerous private stalls, each with its own chandelier. Tin ceilings mimic the building’s original tin ceilings found in the Tap Room. Plenty of sparkles complement the chandeliers and empowering messages adorn many of the walls. The floral floor tile is reminiscent of a bygone era. The mirrors and chandeliers above the sinks are all custom made in the company’s logo colors, adding a classy marketing touch. There is even a brown, velvet fainting couch in the corner. As the picture when leaving the ladies room indicates: ""You are the fairest of them all.""Juban’s Creole Restaurant (Baton Rouge, Louisiana): Juban’s Creole Restaurant believes everything should be intentional, including in the restrooms. Renovated in 2022, the restrooms in dark blues with pops of millennial pink create a backdrop for perfect selfies. A pale pink couch rests in front of a Cher quote in the women's restroom. Meanwhile, guests can take their very own Juban’s branded photo strips in the photo booth outside the men’s and ladies’ rooms.Little America Hotel (Salt Lake City, Utah): When visiting Little America Hotel Salt Lake City, experience a touch of glamour where each stall showcases its own crystal chandelier and floor-to-ceiling doors for total privacy. Every detail is meticulously designed, from the coordinated pink color scheme that unifies the carpet, imported Italian marble, wallpaper and curated artwork, to the intentionally hand-selected materials that elevate the space.Rabbit Hole (Greenville, South Carolina): The restroom at the Rabbit Hole is a whimsical take on an Alice in Wonderland theme. From the moment you enter, you are engulfed in wall-to-wall framed images of various noble rabbits. A rose garden ceiling sits above and the words from an Alice in Wonderland audiobook are read over a speaker.Snowbasin Resort (Huntsville, Utah): One of the oldest continuously operating ski resorts in the nation, Utah’s Snowbasin Resort features luxurious restrooms that are a sight to behold. The design exudes an elevated feel with Italian Carrera marble complemented with bronze and crystal chandeliers. In addition, the facilities feature hand-painted walls and provide plush hand towels. With floor-to-ceiling commodes, guests have the utmost privacy in their own individual, enclosed rooms. The pristine allure leaves guests feeling bad about entering them with ski boots on.Story continuesThe top 10 finalists were selected based on cleanliness, visual appeal, innovation, functionality and unique design elements. The winner will be honored with a place in the America’s Best Restroom Hall of Fame and receive a Cintas UltraClean® restroom cleaning service and $2,500 in facility services or restroom cleaning from Cintas.Last year, the Tampa International Airport won the title of having America’s Best Restroom for its high-design, spacious restrooms, coupled with quality craftsmanship and an inviting, yet durable, material palette.Vote for your favorite restroom at bestrestroom.com.For contest updates, fun facts and restroom trivia, ""follow"" America’s Best Restroom on Twitter at twitter.com/BestRestroom and Facebook at facebook.com/bestrestroom.For more information about the contest, please contact Christina Alvarez at calvarez@mulberrymc.com or (708) 908-0898.About Cintas CorporationCintas Corporation helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes get Ready™ to open their doors with confidence every day by providing a wide range of products and services that enhance our customers’ image and help keep their facilities and employees clean, safe and looking their best.

Recently, EW broke through the 20-day moving average, which suggests a short-term bullish trend.The 20-day simple moving average is a popular trading tool. It provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period, and is beneficial to short-term traders since it smooths out price fluctuations and provides more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.Similar to other SMAs, if a stock's price moves above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive, while price falling below the moving average can signal a downward trend.EW could be on the verge of another rally after moving 7.1% higher over the last four weeks. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.The bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account EW's positive earnings estimate revisions. There have been 1 revisions higher for the current fiscal year compared to none lower, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Investors may want to watch EW for more gains in the near future given the company's key technical level and positive earnings estimate revisions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company’s bullish long-term growth strategy buoys optimism for the stock, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Edwards Lifesciences exited the first quarter of 2023 on a bullish note with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. It also registered year-over-year growth on both fronts. The company’s TMTT segment recorded strong growth, driven by the continued adoption of the PASCAL Precision system in Europe.During the quarter, EW completed the enrollment of the TRISCEND II pivotal trial for the EVOQUE Tricuspid Valve Replacement System. Further, growth within Surgical Structural Heart was lifted by the increased adoption of Edwards' premium products across all regions. The company raised its full-year 2023 guidance, which is encouraging too.Critical Care sales were up 9% on an underlying basis in the first quarter of 2023. Sales growth was led by the Smart Recovery portfolio and the strong adoption of the Acumen IQ sensor and finger cuff featuring a unique Hypotension Prediction Index algorithm.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation PriceEdwards Lifesciences Corporation PriceEdwards Lifesciences Corporation price | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteThe demand for Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheters and the HemoSphere monitoring platform also remained strong in the first quarter, with a healthy pipeline of future opportunities. The company remains excited about its pipeline of Critical Care innovations as it continues to shift its focus to Smart Recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions and get patients home to their families faster.Based on the strong first-quarter performance, Edwards Lifesciences now expects Critical Care full-year 2023 sales in the band of $870-$940 million.Meanwhile, the contraction of both margins in the first quarter is discouraging. In the first quarter, the gross margin contracted 25 basis points (bps) to 77.4%. The company-provided adjusted gross margin was 77.5%, a 30-basis point contraction year over year. This year-over-year reduction was due to a less favorable impact from foreign exchange. During the quarter, operating income fell 2.3% year over year. The operating margin contracted 339 bps to 29.6%.Story continuesWe also remain worried about the significant challenges Edward Lifesciences is facing due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact that has been adversely affecting the company’s profitability.Meanwhile, the medical device industry is highly competitive with the presence of several competent players. In Heart Valve Therapy, Edwards Lifesciences primarily competes with Medtronic and Sorin Group, whereas players, such as ICU Medical, Pulsion Medical Systems AG, LiDCO Group and Becton, Dickinson, offer competition in other segments.In the past year, Edwards Lifesciences has underperformed its industry. The stock has declined 6.9% against the 9.1% rise of the industry.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector are Haemonetics HAE, Zimmer Biomet ZBH and SiBone SIBN. While Haemonetics sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Zimmer Biomet and SiBone each carry a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Haemonetics stock has risen 29.8% in the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Haemonetics’ earnings per share (EPS) has increased from $3.55 to $3.56 for fiscal 2024 and remained constant at $3.96 for fiscal 2025 in the past 30 days.HAE’s earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 12.21%. In the last reported quarter, the company registered an earnings surprise of 13.24%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Zimmer Biomet’s 2023 EPS has remained constant at $7.45 in the past 30 days.

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Edwards Lifesciences (EW) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to EW for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Edwards Lifesciences' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Edwards Lifesciences' main business drivers.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, headquartered in Irvine, CA, deals in products and technologies aimed at treating advanced cardiovascular diseases, especially structural heart disease in critically ill patients. The company is the world’s leading manufacturer of tissue heart valves and repair products used to replace or repair a patient's diseased or defective heart valve. Edwards is also a leading player in hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patient's cardiovascular function in the hospital setting.The company’s products and technologies are categorized into four main areas: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR), Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies (TMTT), Surgical Structural Heart, and Critical Care.TAVR (64.4% of total revenues in 2022, underlying growth rate was 4.8% from 2021): This segment includes the SAPIEN family of valves used to treat heart valve diseases using catheter-based approaches for patients who have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and certain patients with congenital heart disease.TMTT (2.3%, up 36.2%): This segment consists of the PASCAL transcatheter valve repair system and the Cardioband systems for mitral and tricuspid valve repair, which are commercially available in Europe. The PASCAL system provides a differentiated, minimally-invasive therapy to address the needs of patients with mitral regurgitation through leaflet approximation, while the Cardioband system enables clinicians to restore a patient’s mitral or tricuspid valve to a more functional state by reducing the annulus and lowering regurgitation.Story continuesSurgical Structural Heart (16.6%; up 8.1%): This segment primarily comprises tissue heart valves and heart valve repair products for the surgical repair or replacement of a patient's heart valve. The portfolio also includes a diverse line of products used during minimally invasive surgical procedures, and cannulae, embolic protection devices and other products used during cardiopulmonary bypass.Critical Care (16.7%, up 13.4%): Critical Care portfolio includes pulmonary artery catheters, disposable pressure transducers and advanced monitoring systems. The portfolio also includes a line of balloon catheter-based products, surgical clips and inserts.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Edwards Lifesciences ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in July 2013 would be worth $8,398.09, or a gain of 739.81%, as of July 11, 2023, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.The S&amp;P 500 rose 166.82% and the price of gold increased 48.07% over the same time frame in comparison.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for EW.Edwards Lifesciences exited the first quarter of 2023 on a bullish note, with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company’s TMTT segment registered strong growth, driven by the continued adoption of the PASCAL Precision system in Europe. During the quarter, the company completed the enrolment of the TRISCEND II pivotal trial for the EVOQUE Tricuspid Valve Replacement System. Growth within Surgical Structural Heart was led by the increased adoption of Edwards' premium products across all regions. The raised full-year 2023 guidance is encouraging too. Yet, the contraction of both margins is discouraging. The choppy market conditions due to the persistent foreign exchange impact and stiff competition within the medical device industry are a concern. In the past year, Edwards Lifesciences underperformed its industry.The stock has jumped 7.09% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 1 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

June CPI report is expected to show the index rising at its slowest annual pace since March of 2021, though it's unlikely to move the needle on what's seen as a surefire Fed rate hike. Investors are betting on another quarter point increase at the end of the month. And as for stocks, Barclays is the latest big bank to weigh in. It raised its 2023 price target on the S&amp;P 500 to $4,150 from $3,725.Prime Day is upon us yet again. And you guessed it, it's going to be bigger and better than ever, also longer.

Meta's Threads messaging service has accumulated 100 million plus users in a matter of days, boosting speculation that it could pose an existential threat to Elon Musk's company, Twitter. Bullish sentiment around the platform is being driven by its leveraging of Instagram, which already boasts 1 billion monthly active users. Worth remembering, it's still early days for the app. There isn't a hashtag yet, and search is limited to only usernames.]"

David Paterson says it's been a 'frightening time' in NYC with toxic smog and a battered real estate market — but he's bullish long term. 3 cheap ways to bet on a Big Apple turnaround,Moneywise,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ex-gov-david-paterson-says-130000014.html,1689080400,STORY,"['ESRT', 'NYC', 'EQR']","[This former governor says it's been a 'frightening time' in NYC with toxic smog and a battered real estate market — but he's bullish long term. 3 cheap ways to bet on a Big Apple turnaroundIt’s been “a frightening time” to be in the Big Apple, according to New York’s ex-governor David Paterson.Speaking with John Catsimatidis on his radio show, Paterson described how toxic smog from Canada, the ongoing migration crisis and the growing vacancy rate across the city’s shiny office towers are creating havoc for citizens.Don't missRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord. Here's howHere's how much money the average middle-class American household makes — how do you stack up?New York’s air quality was briefly the worst in the world in early June, as smoke from Canadian wildfires drifted over the city. Meanwhile, the office vacancy rate hit a record high of 22.7% earlier this year, raising alarm bells for commercial real estate investors and Wall Street.Despite these overlapping crises, Paterson remained hopeful about the city’s long-term future. He compared the current situation to the city’s fiscal crisis in the 1970s and the aftermath of the Sept. 11th attacks: “New York has always been a resilient city that’s always kind of bounced back,” he said. “We still have that resilience, that desire and that drive to bring the city back as one of the great cities, if not the greatest city, in this country,”Investors who share this optimism could see the ongoing dip in sentiment as an opportunity to invest in New York’s most attractive assets.Iconic propertiesThe best way to make a contrarian bet on New York’s rebound is to own a piece of its iconic skyline. Empire State Realty Trust ([NYSE:ESRT), as the name suggests, owns the Empire State building along with other commercial and residential properties spread across the city.Altogether, the portfolio includes 8.9 million square feet of office space, 718,000 square feet of retail space and 721 residential units across three multifamily properties.Story continuesThe stock is flat over the past year, but is down 58.4% over the past five years. However, it’s looking relatively cheap right now. The stock trades at a price-to-book ratio of 1.18, which means each unit of stock is worth 118% of the value of the underlying property.The stock also offers a 2% dividend yield with a 42.4% dividend payout. That means there’s room for the dividend to expand if revenue or occupancy rebounds in the years ahead.Read more: 3 big mistakes people make with cash back credit cards that cost them every time they swipeCommercial propertiesAmerican Strategic Investment Co.’s ticker symbol (NYSE:NYC) makes it clear that the stock is a proxy for the city’s economy. The company was formerly known as New York City REIT. The portfolio includes eight commercial properties with a total of 1.2 million square feet spread throughout Manhattan. As of the first quarter of 2023, the total occupancy rate of these properties was 84%, higher than the city’s average.Also, the average lease term had seven years remaining — many of the company’s tenants won’t be leaving for a while. The tenant mix is also comforting, with 26% in the financial services sector and 13% in government agencies and services. Government tenants are somewhat immune to the business cycle while financial services are more tethered to the global economy than New York alone.The stock trades at just 6% of book value per share, which makes it severely undervalued.Apartment propertiesLegendary investor Sam Zell, who passed away earlier this year, was famous for his contrarian bets. In one of his last public appearances, Zell called remote work “bulls—” and was convinced employees would head back to the office. His company EquityResidential (NYSE:EQR) is certainly positioned for it with extensive exposure to America’s largest cities and over 36 properties in New York City.The company’s portfolio consists of 301 properties with 79,351 apartment units across major cities like Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Seattle, San Francisco and Southern California, Denver, Atlanta, Dallas/Ft. Worth and Austin. The stock offers a 3.9% dividend yield and trades at a price-to-book ratio of 2.23 — which makes it the most expensive REIT on this list.What to read nextYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)This janitor in Vermont built an $8M fortune without anyone around him knowing.

That’s good news for savers, but bad news for lenders as they prepare to release their second-quarter results.US banks spent the last several months competing with each other to keep or bring back depositors following the turmoil that took down three sizable regional institutions and triggered outflows across the banking system.That scramble pushed rates on savings accounts to 5.05% at the end of the second quarter, according to Bankrate, their steepest level since February 2008.Read more: The best high-yield savings account rates for July 2023The challenge for banks across the US is that these higher funding costs are eating into a key measure of profitability known as net interest margin, which measures the difference between what lenders make from their loans and what they pay for their deposits.That will likely act as a drag on results for some banks in the quarter, especially the mid-sized regional institutions that ran into trouble last spring, while reducing estimates of what they can earn for the rest of the year.“The surprises this quarter will be for the banks that do not lower expectations,” Wells Fargo bank analyst Mike Mayo told Yahoo Finance.Banks, added Argus Research's Stephen Biggar, ""have a deposit conundrum.""'Green shoots'?These pressures will be at the front of mind for investors starting Friday as they digest the first set of second quarter earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and State Street (STT).Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report next Tuesday and Goldman Sachs (GS) next Wednesday. A slew of other regional banks will also report in the coming weeks.Some of the biggest US banks are expected to once again demonstrate their resilience and diversity, showing they can continue to charge more for their loans while leaning on their sprawling franchises to generate additional revenue.Story continuesJPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America are all expected to show jumps in net income when compared to the year-earlier period, according to analyst estimates, while Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley are expected to report profit declines.JPMorgan's headquarters in New York City. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Those that are more dependent on investment banking, such as Goldman, are expected to be particularly challenged by a recent drought in deal making.Global investment banking revenues for the second quarter fell by 8% from the first quarter and 52% from a year ago, according to Dealogic. However, the business improved through the second half of the quarter, prompting some observers to predict “green shoots” ahead.“I’m turning to believing investment banking will not have great earnings but they’re going to be surprising, and I think better than expected,” said Dick Bove, a bank analyst with Odeon Capital.Investors will also be watching to see whether many of these big banks increase the amounts they set aside for future loan losses, a sign that they expect the US economy and credit conditions to worsen.“We're starting to see some increased delinquencies, particularly in the credit card and auto lending market,” said Biggar, Argus Research's director of financial services.'A huge amount of problems'Smaller regional banks are clearly not under the same amount of pressure as they were in March, when the fall of Silicon Valley Bank triggered panic across the country.But they still “face a huge amount of problems,” Bove said.The core issue is an aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to bring down inflation with higher interest rates. That campaign is lowering the value of the assets banks hold, such as bonds, while deposit costs creep higher and loan demand slows.Read more: Why now is a good time to open a savings account“We view accelerating deposit costs, not accelerating deposit outflows, as the most significant headwind to earnings for the next several quarters,“ Manan Gosalia, a regional bank analyst for Morgan Stanley, said in a research note.Higher rates have traditionally worked to the advantage of banks since it allows them to charge more for their loans than their deposits.But the panic of the spring “has changed the calculus a bit” for some banks, the Fed’s vice chair of supervision Michael Barr said Monday. Some lenders “are now paying up more for deposits,” and the Fed is “paying careful attention to that.”Silicon Valley Bank was seized on March 10. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The Fed has made it clear that more hikes are coming this year. Regulators are also preparing new capital requirements for banks with more than $100 billion in assets that will force some to hold greater buffers against losses. That will increase the stability of those lenders but will also make it even more difficult to earn robust profits in the near term.Many banks have already warned at a conference in June that their net interest margins are going to drop by more than they expected for the quarter or the year, including executives for US Bancorp (USB), Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Comerica (CMA), Huntington (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), and Zions (ZION).“I’ve only been a banker for 10 years, so I haven’t seen a time when we’ve needed deposits as an industry as much as we do now,” Darrin Williams, the CEO of the 58-branch Southern Bancorp, told Yahoo Finance.The amount Southern Bancorp is paying customers has risen 600% since the Fed’s interest rate hiking cycle began, Williams added.“Our cost of funds continues to rise just because our customers demand that.”The larger banks aren’t immune to some of these same challenges.“Deposits will continue the trend of being slightly down from here,” Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase's massive consumer and community bank, said at a conference in June.The bank has predicted it will earn net interest income of $84 billion in 2023, but if the deposit pressure keeps up, that figure could experience a “mild reprice,” she said.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

To skip our detailed analysis of the banking industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Local Bank Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The 2023 Banking CrisisIn March 2023, the US banking industry witnessed a severe crisis with the failure of three small-to-mid-sized banks. These included Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Silvergate Bank, and Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY). The collapse of these three banks sent the US public into a panic. The SVB collapse, in particular, led to a significant uproar considering the fact that the bank's clients included major technology companies and wealthy individuals who had made large deposits with the bank. Rising interest rates had led to these three banks suffering large unrealized losses on US Treasury bond holdings, and the resulting failures of these institutions set in motion the 2023 banking crisis.The banking industry has managed to settle down somewhat since March, especially since the Federal Reserve made promises to honor the deposits of the three failing banks. Here's a comment from the Federal Reserve's Chair, Jerome Powell, on the situation, made this March:""You have seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when there's a threat of serious harm to the economy or to the financial system, and we're prepared to use those tools. I think depositors should assume that their deposits are safe.""Despite the above statement, it is to be noted that Chairman Powell sidestepped the question of whether the Federal Reserve is prepared to bail out the depositors of banks with less than $1 billion in assets in the event that such a bank fails. Thus while the Fed seems to have extended a guarantee for the deposits of larger banks, the situation seems unclear when it comes to smaller banks and their depositors, throwing the clientele of such banks and the institutions into a frenzy over what to expect from the Fed in the event that the banking crisis worsens.Story continuesBig Banks May Be In The Clear, But What About Small Banks?Additionally, according to CNBC, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also commented this March that not all banks in the US, regardless of their size, would be fully insured. So while US bank regulators managed to fully insure the deposits of SVB and Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY), this treatment has not been promised to all other US banks in the event of a collapse, leaving smaller banks and their depositors in a state of paranoia. This paranoia also led to smaller US banks facing increased amounts of withdrawals while mega-banks began gaining in deposits. According to a Wall Street Journal article from this March, after the SVB collapse, the 25 largest banks in the US gained about $120 billion in deposits, as shown by Federal Reserve data. At the same time, smaller US banks suffered from losses amounting to $108 billion over the same period.In his interview on CNBC this March, Nelson Peltz, the founder of Trian Fund Management, commented on this situation:""All the money as we know is leaving the small community banks and the regional banks and going to the three or four largest banks in America, and that's a very dangerous situation, and it's got to be resolved. What I would do is this: I would put together a plan that applies only to the US banks, and that the Fed gets an insurance premium for any money you leave in a US-accredited bank over $250,000. So you're creating income for the Fed, and in exchange for that they insure the coverage.""The plan put forth by Peltz envisions a guarantee from the Fed for all bank deposits regardless of the bank's size while also charging the bank's customers for that insurance. However, no such policy has been adopted by the Fed at present, leaving local US banks in a state of uncertainty while large banks like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) continue to gain. As of July 9, for instance, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is up by 6.82% year-to-date, while shares of smaller banks like Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) are down by 22.77% year-to-date.While the situation seems dire, it should be noted that the outflow of deposits from small banks cooled down since the initial frenzy right after the collapse of SVB and the other two banks, as CNBC reported near the end of March. This means that smaller US banks may have more hope than initially expected. As such, the investing public is looking for the best regional bank stocks to buy now or the best small bank stocks to invest in as the banking crisis cools down. As such, we have compiled a list of these stocks below.11 Best Local Bank Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Mikel Parera on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe selected local American bank stocks that were the most popular among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey during the first quarter of 2023 to compile our list below. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number.Best Local Bank Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds11. PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Brandon King at Truist Securities has a Hold rating on PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW)  shares as of June 29, alongside a $10 price target.PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) is a local US bank based in Los Angeles, California. It offers business banking and treasury management services.PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) was spotted in the 13F holdings of 22 hedge funds during the first quarter, with a total stake value of $139 million.Manole Capital Management mentioned PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“25 years ago, there were 13,000 financial institutions, but now there’s really only 4,000 banks left. Will we continue to see consolidation? With JP Morgan buying First Republic, the latest worry seems to PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW). In a recent security filing, it reported that it lost 9.5% of its total deposits, with most of it happening over two days. For PacWest and other regional banks, they are fighting a two-sided battle. On one side, investors are finally demanding higher yields and the media is highlighting the risk of keeping assets at struggling banks. On the other side, short sellers are eager to identify the next possible “weak (banking) link”.”10. East West Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23East West Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC) is a regional bank based in Pasadena, California. It is the bank holding company for East West Bank.Truist Securities analyst Jennifer Demba holds a Buy rating on East West Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC) shares as of June 29, alongside a $62 price target.Our hedge fund data shows 23 funds long East West Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $362 million.Citadel Investment Group held 1.7 million shares in East West Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC) at the end of the first quarter, making it the largest shareholder in the company.Aristotle Capital Management mentioned East West Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC) in its first-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We purchased East West Bancorp in the third quarter of 2017; however, our history with the business stretches back further having twice previously invested. Companies we consider to be high-quality like East West tend to remain high quality, and we have long admired the business for its uniqueness among the otherwise homogenous U.S. banking industry. Its dominant market share built over generations in Asian communities – and difficult-to-replicate experience due to culture, geography and business practices – create distinct competitive advantages in our view. During our most recent holding period, the bank achieved sustained loan growth, a catalyst we identified, through its continued leadership position as the financial “bridge” for customers doing business in the U.S. and China. Moreover, East West also realized market share gains in its headquarters state of California. With these catalysts nearing completion, we decided to exit our investment to fund the purchase of Oshkosh. As always, we will continue to study East West and, in the future, may once again find an opportunity to be investors.”Like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), East West Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC) is a bank stock worth keeping an eye on in the second half of 2023.9. Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Betsy Graseck at Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating on Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) shares on June 26, alongside a $25 price target.Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) is a regional bank providing financial services to individual and corporate customers.

It is based in Columbus, Ohio, and operates as the bank holding company for The Huntington National Bank.As of July 7, Morgan Stanley's Betsy Graseck holds an Overweight rating on Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) shares alongside a $12 price target.Citadel Investment Group was the largest shareholder in Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) at the end of the first quarter, holding 14.9 million shares.7. KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) is a diversified banking company and the holding company for KeyBank National Association. It is based in Cleveland, Ohio.Gerard Cassidy at RBC Capital maintains an Outperform rating on KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) shares as of June 13, alongside a price target of $14.Out of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the first quarter, 34 funds were long KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), with a total stake value of $573 million.6.

It is based in Buffalo, New York.Morgan Stanley analyst Manan Gosalia holds an Overweight rating and a $155 price target on M&amp;T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB) shares as of July 7.Here's what The London Company said about M&amp;T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“M&amp;T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB)- MTB underperformed, along with other regional banks, on the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and fear of broader contagion. Importantly, MTB has neither the same kind of client concentration risk nor duration risk that impacted Silicon Valley Bank. Particularly with respect to duration risk, MTB was an outlier in its conservatism with respect to buying shorter-term securities in a very low rate environment. MTB does have exposure to commercial real estate, including office real estate.

47,797c5a05-83a7-3f95-befd-fdfc3eb99966,IT,2023-07-12,How HR leaders can get the most out of their shrinking budgets this year,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hr-leaders-most-shrinking-budgets-115034690.html,1689076234,STORY,['IT'],"[Good morning!Today's HR heads are balancing a lot. They've been asked to secure highly skilled talent, upskill and reskill employees, and upfit digital infrastructure with shrinking budgets.How much money companies are willing to allocate to HR needs has declined over the past year. A recent report from management consulting firm Gartner finds that 25% of 2023 HR budgets decreased, compared to 12% in 2022. Twenty-eight percent of leaders say their budgets have remained stagnant year over year. Despite this drop in financial investment, expectations for HR heads are still high. A separate Garner survey of senior business executives found that CEOs prioritize the workforce and technology. That puts HR leaders in a tough predicament, where they'll have to be strategic about how they, in turn, divvy up more modest budgets.Seyda Berger-Böcker, a director at Gartner and one of the report's authors, says HR heads should prioritize technology and recruiting because they're the two biggest growth drivers in most organizations. To do so, CHROs will have to balance costs in three ways:Reduce. Reduction doesn't mean cutting headcount. Rather, it could be a reduction of processes, tools, or services. Employers should also consider what projects they can cancel or postpone for now. Reducing headcount should be a last resort.Replace. Now is an optimum time to reconsider and renegotiate terms with external vendors. Reevaluate what tasks to bring in-house at a lower cost and what processes make more financial sense to outsource altogether.Rethink. Take a step back and look at HR spend in its entirety. Perhaps you need an upfront investment in one area to reduce costs later or in another sphere. One example is redesigning your HR operating model or investing in new technology to automate processes that might have once consumed a large portion of your team's time.Tangentially, and to the detriment of employers, talent analytics is the top resource HR leaders most frequently underinvest in when cutting costs, Berger-Böcker says. Gartner's latest benchmarking data finds only 2.5% of HR budgets are allocated toward talent analytics tools.Story continues“Without an understanding of what data to focus on and the skills to understand and interpret the data, HR employees will not be able to effectively guide the decision-making of business stakeholders,” she says.Amber Burtonamber.burton@fortune.com@amberbburtonThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

The Iranian tanker fled toward Malaysian territorial waters spilling oil as the hose connecting the two tankers came loose. The tanker ignored various signals to stop, ranging from horns and warnings via loudspeakers to shots in the air, Kurnia said.He added that the Iranian tanker, which was also carrying three passengers besides its crew, was later arrested by Indonesian Coast Guard with the help of its Malaysian counterpart. The Cameroon-flagged tanker managed to escape.Authorities were still questioning the tanker’s Egyptian national captain and 28 Syrian crew members, Kurnia said.Kurnia said the tanker was facing a variety of violations, including not displaying a national flag, shutting off their identification systems, anchoring illegally, as well as the illegal transfer of fuel between ships and spilling oil.Authorities were escorting the Iranian tanker to Batam island, near Singapore, for further investigation, Kurnia said.In 2021, Indonesian authorities seized another Iranian tanker and a Panamanian tanker over a similar illegal transfer of oil. The tankers were released months later after a court case where they were fined 2 billion rupiah (nearly $140,000) for spilling oil into the sea. The captains of the vessels were sentenced to one year in jail.Story continuesIran, home to major oil and natural gas reserves, has seen its sales abroad deeply impacted by U.S. sanctions after former President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. That cut a crucial source of government revenue in Iran’s long-anemic economy.Since then, Iran has relied on black-market sales and deals with Venezuela to keep its sales going.Iran’s state-owned fleet of oil tankers routinely turns off their Automatic Identification System trackers to try and mask where they deliver their cargo. Those AIS beacons, a safety measure so other ships know what’s around them, can be tracked. Analysts say those ships often transfer their oil to other ships, that then sell the crude oil under false pretenses.]"

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled up 92 cents, or 1.2%, to $75.75 a barrel.Forecasts from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) point to the market tightening into 2024.The IEA expects the oil market to stay tight in the second half of 2023, citing strong demand from China and developing countries combined with supply cuts from leading producers. New forecasts from the IEA are expected this week.""The oil balance gets tighter either when supply is downgraded, or demand is revised up. If both happens at the same time the change can be seismic,"" said PVM analyst Tamas Varga referring to the EIA's outlook.""Clearly, it is not worried about inflation-induced recession that could potentially dent global oil consumption.""Top producer Saudi Arabia pledged last week to extend a production cut of 1 million bpd in August, while Russia will cut exports by 500,000 bpd.Pressuring prices was a U.S. Energy Information Administration report of a much bigger-than-expected U.S. crude stock build of nearly 6 million barrels last week.Gasoline inventories remained largely unchanged at 219.5 million barrels during the Fourth of July holiday week, a situation that is ""almost unheard of,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures group.

An increasing number of oil and gas producers are now expanding their portfolios to include renewable energy operations, from wind and solar power to green hydrogen. But this doesn’t mean they’re giving up on the energy sources that brought them all their wealth. Energy firms around the globe are going full throttle on their oil and gas plans to ensure they continue profiting from fossil fuels while the global demand remains high. Instead of shifting to renewable alternatives, they are driving both their fossil fuel and green alternative businesses, while also investing heavily in decarbonisation technologies to respond to pressure from governments and international organisations.An International Energy Agency (IEA) forecast suggests that oil demand will fall by around 75 percent by 2050, from 2020 levels. Oil prices are therefore expected to decrease to around $35 a barrel in 2030 and $25 a barrel in 2050. But instead of this prediction dissuading oil majors from investing in new operations, it seems to be spurring them on. Oil and gas companies around the world are unwilling to miss out on any potential oil and gas revenues, particularly while global demand continues to remain high. This has led several oil majors to accelerate production to ensure their output is high before demand eventually wanes. Further, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions on Russian energy has led many countries around the globe to seek alternative sources. There was a severe oil and gas shortage last year, driving up the price of these fossil fuels. Oil and gas firms worldwide saw record profits, as governments pleaded with OPEC to increase its output to drive down prices, to no avail.Story continuesAccording to a GlobalData analysis of executive fields data, the world’s five largest Western oil majors by revenue – BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalEnergies – are planning for a future misaligned with a net-zero pathway, as outlined by the IEA. This may be surprising for some to hear considering that all these companies have also pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. This is further reflected in the pledges of governments in the countries in which they are based. The analysis is dire, suggesting that the oil and gas extraction plans of just 25 oil majors will contribute CO2 emissions that use up 90 percent of the world’s remaining 1.5°C carbon budget.The five oil majors mentioned above all have major expansion plans. Together, they hope to develop 157 new fields, in addition to the 1,350 already in operation. This is expected to increase the companies’ oil production from 299 billion barrels of oil equivalent (bboe) to 421 bboe. The analysis shows that four companies – Shell, TotalEnergies, Chevron and Eni, approved a total of $58 billion in funding for new projects in 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, which would produce enough fossil fuel to meet oil and gas demand in a 2.5°C global warming scenario rather than the 1.5°C scenario. The companies are taking advantage of the profits seen in 2022 to the detriment of a global green transition, investing in expensive regions that may not be financially viable when demand falls.But these oil majors are not apologetic about their decisions. The CEO of TotalEnergies, Patrick Pouyanne, recently defended the company’s greenhouse gas emissions strategy, emphasising that Total remains committed to oil and gas. He confirmed that the firm has allocated almost one-third of its capital expenditure to low-carbon technologies, with the rest earmarked for oil and gas.Pouyanne stated, “We are in both pillars, and we will remain on both pillars [for a long time].” He added, “Today, our society requires oil and gas … Why we are together, it is 80 percent of fossil fuels. There is no way to think that overnight we can just eliminate all that and rely only on 10 percent of low-carbon energy. It will take decades to build a new system.” Further, “we must do two things: To continue to produce the oil and gas, [while] of course being very strict on the emissions. The question is not fossil fuels, it is emissions, to lower the emissions,” he explained.Pouyanne stressed the need to drive down oil prices, particularly following the elevated prices of 2022, which led to a global economic crisis and hit consumers particularly hard. The CEO believes that his company should be focusing on low-carbon oil production, rather than moving away from it altogether. This approach has been widely seen by oil majors, many of whom are investing in carbon capture and storage technologies, as well as several other decarbonisation methods. But climate activists worldwide are continuing to lobby against oil and gas companies, asking for stricter government regulations and appealing to firms to do more to support a green transition.By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Regulators Delay Approval For UK's Largest Undeveloped Oil And Gas FieldThe Politics Of The Strategic Petroleum Reserve: A Comprehensive ReviewCorporations Gear Up For Mandatory Carbon DisclosuresRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

The greenback extended its fall into the Asian session, falling 0.4% against a basket of currencies.Tightening supplies, as production cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia took effect, also buoyed oil prices.Brent oil futures rose 0.4% to $79.62 a barrel, their strongest level since early-May, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 0.3% to $75.03 a barrel by 21:32 ET (01:32 GMT). Both contracts rallied over 2% on Tuesday, settling at 10-week peaks.Brent was close to breaking above $80 a barrel, which analysts said could send more bullish signals to crude markets.U.S. CPI in focus amid Fed rate hike speculationHowever, anticipation of key U.S. consumer price index (CPI) inflation data spurred some cooling in oil’s recent rally. Wednesday’s CPI reading is expected to show lower headline inflation, while core CPI inflation is expected to have remained sticky.Stubborn core inflation is largely expected to invite more interest rate hikes from the Fed as it moves to cool high price pressures. The central bank is set to hike rates by at least 25 basis points in an end-July meeting, with a slew of officials warning that more hikes are in store.But several Fed officials also said that the Fed was close to concluding its rate hike cycle, which sparked a rally in risk-driven assets this week, while denting the dollar.U.S. inventories seen risingData from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed that U.S. crude stockpiles unexpectedly grew by over 2 million barrels in the week to July 7.Story continuesThe API data usually heralds a similar reading from official Energy Information Administration data due later on Wednesday, which is forecast to show a draw of 2.2 million barrels.China stimulus in store?Oil markets were also awaiting signals on any more stimulus measures in major crude importer China, as the country grapples with a slowing post-COVID economic recovery.Chinese Communist Party-backed media house the China Securities Journal reported on Wednesday that Beijing is likely to increase stimulus spending to support the economy, following a string of weak economic readings in the country.Increased Chinese stimulus measures are expected to spruce up economic growth in the country, which in turn could help drive oil demand higher as domestic fuel consumption increases.Related ArticlesOil rises as dollar slides before CPI data, Brent nears $80Gold prices rise as Fed fears ease ahead of CPI reportUS climate envoy John Kerry to travel to China next week]"

57,acfdb5af-4fd1-31c8-97c4-2e669069b671,OMC,2023-07-12,Omnicom (OMC) to Report Q2 Results: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/omnicom-omc-report-q2-results-140021275.html,1689084021,STORY,['OMC'],"[Omnicom (OMC) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis advertising company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.1%.Revenues are expected to be $3.62 billion, up 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.35% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Omnicom?For Omnicom, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.64%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Omnicom will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Omnicom would post earnings of $1.38 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.56, delivering a surprise of +13.04%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Omnicom doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For more stocks on this list, head on over to 5 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Now.The macroeconomic landscape in the United States, which has been a focal point in headlines and the stock market for over two years, is undergoing a rapid transformation. Just a year ago, investors' primary concerns revolved around interest rates and heightened inflation. However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent commodity shock, along with pandemic-induced stimulatory spending, compelled the Federal Reserve to swiftly increase interest rates. As the market enters the second half of 2023, the Federal Reserve's decisive approach to interest rate hikes is finally bringing about some clarity regarding an economic cooldown.Earlier this June, Fed officials made predictions indicating their intention to raise interest rates twice more within the year, assuming these adjustments would be made in quarter-point increments. However, that does not mean that the Fed must hurt the labor market to achieve policymakers’ goals. In fact, Fed Chair Powell has acknowledged that wages are not necessarily the primary factor driving current inflation. He has noted that wages and inflation often exhibit a correlated relationship, but determining which one is causing the other is challenging to determine.As the July 7 payrolls report approached, traders were preparing for a potentially impactful event. Surprisingly robust data released by the ADP Research Institute a day prior had convinced the market that job growth in the US was still ""too strong"" from the perspective of central bankers cautious about inflation. According to the report, US employers added 209,000 jobs in June, falling short of Wall Street expectations. This led to concerns that the Federal Reserve might implement tighter monetary policy. However, the outcome presented a more nuanced view of the labor market, indicating a moderate slowdown that aligns with the Fed's objectives, albeit at a slower pace than anticipated by some. Investors widely expect the Fed to raise interest rates at their July meeting, and the strength of the labor market could help to shape the outlook after that.Story continuesThese are all developments affecting the market in the short-term. If you are a long-term investor who is looking for forever stocks to buy as we do in our monthly newsletter, you hope that the stock market declines by at least 20% to buy your favorite stocks at a discount. At the end of September 2022, the market provided such an opportunity.

With market sentiment strong and supported by seemingly justifiable factors, investors may lean towards riskier securities with higher potential returns.

When it comes to long-term investments, who better to imitate than Wall Street's legendary value investor, Warren Buffett.

Using this information, the stocks were ranked.To be clear the following 13 stocks are the best forever stocks to buy according to billionaire investor and secret hedge fund manager Warren Buffett. We have our own list of favorite forever stocks that we share in our premium newsletter. You should do your own research and decide any of the following stocks fit your definition of forever stocks:13. DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) is a prominent healthcare company specializing in kidney care services. With a significant presence, it ranks among the largest providers of dialysis services in the United States. The company's primary focus lies in treating individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney failure.Lisa Bedell Clive at Bernstein issued an update on May 15, raising the price target on DaVita Inc. (NYSE: DVA) from $88 to $100. This adjustment came in response to the company's improved 2023 guidance, which was announced on May 9.After digging through 943 hedge funds for their March quarter of 2023 investments, Insider Monkey discovered that 32 had bought DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)’s shares. The firm’s second largest investor after Warren Buffett is Jeffrey Gates’ Gates Capital Management, owning one million shares that are worth $84 million.Here is what Moon Capital Management said about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) ranks among the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a decent stock for long-term investments.12. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), commonly known as Kraft Heinz, is an American multinational food company formed by the merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz Company co-headquartered in Chicago and Pittsburgh. The company is involved in making and selling a wide variety of products, including cheese, meals, meats, dairy products, spices, coffee, and others.The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) released its Q1 financial results on May 3, revealing a non-GAAP EPS of $0.68 and revenue of $6.49 billion. These figures exceeded Wall Street estimates by $0.08 and $100 million, respectively. Additionally, the company anticipates a 4% to 6% growth in organic net sales for 2023, as compared to the previous year.Out of the 943 hedge funds included in Insider Monkey's Q1 2023 database, 34 of them held a stake in The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC). First Eagle Investment Management, managed by Jean-Marie Eveillard, emerged as the largest hedge fund investor, with a stake worth $256 million, equivalent to 6.6 million shares. However, the largest overall investor in Kraft Heinz is Warren Buffett, with a massive investment of $12 billion.11. VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Verisign Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) is an American company based in Reston, Virginia, United States, that operates a diverse array of network infrastructure that allows firms to maintain their servers, access domain names, and run security applications. The company ended the first quarter of 2023 with 174.8 million domains in the .com/.net base, which was 1 million more than it ended in the same quarter a year ago.By the end of this year’s first quarter, 37 of the 943 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey’s database had held a stake in the company. Following Warren Buffett, Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)'s largest shareholder, which owns 3.1 million shares that are worth $672 million.10. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), or simply Kroger, is an American retail company that operates supermarkets and multi-department stores throughout the United States. With more than 2,700 supermarkets and multi-department stores spread across 35 states in the United States, The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) ranks as one of the largest food retailers in the world.Earlier this June, UBS lowered the price target on The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) to $48 from $51 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. According to the analysts', sentiment on Kroger remains mixed despite a ""strong"" performance in Q1 as its FY23 outlook remains uncertain. The firm also states that the tone will likely remain mixed until the market gains more confidence in Kroger's intermediate-term outlook and that this will likely leave the stock range-bound for ""the foreseeable future.""Insider Monkey took a look at 943 hedge funds for their first quarter of 2023 investments and found out that 43 had owned The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)’s shares. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns a $2.5 billion stake in the company.Oakmark Funds, advised by Harris Associates, made the following comment about The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption.”9. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO), commonly known as Moody's, is an American business and financial services company. It serves as the parent company for Moody's Investors Service (MIS), an American credit rating agency, and Moody's Analytics (MA), a provider of financial analysis software and services based in the United States.Jeffrey Silber, an analyst at BMO Capital, restated an Outperform rating for Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) stock on May 17, while increasing the target price from $355 to $360. Silber holds the belief that Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) has the potential for a substantial upside of over 16%, considering the closing stock price as of May 18.By the end of Q1 2023, 51 of the 943 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey had bought a stake in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO). A major hedge fund investor is Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management with a $3.17 billion stake.8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Established in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is a prominent American multinational corporation renowned for its production of the iconic Coca-Cola beverage. In addition to its flagship product, the company is involved in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse array of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even some alcoholic beverages within the beverage industry. As one of the largest beverage corporations globally, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) holds a significant position among the long-term investments of renowned value investor Warren Buffett. Buffett, who has maintained a stake in the company since 2010, has famously expressed his unwavering commitment to retain his shares in the company.On June 6, HSBC analyst Carlos Laboy lowered the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $74 from $77 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst views Coca-Cola as a much better defensive stock in inflationary times than in the past. However, his near term concern for beverage giant remains the ongoing tax litigation, which it says could cost the company up to 14 billion in payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”7. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73General Motors, formally the General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), is an American multinational automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, United States.During the initial quarter of 2023, the company experienced an impressive 11.1% growth in revenue compared to the previous year, reaching nearly $40 billion. Additionally, the automotive operating cash flow for the quarter rose to $2.3 billion, showcasing a significant increase from $1.6 billion in the same period of the previous year.Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) from an Equal Weight rating to an Overweight rating on May 1. Additionally, the analyst increased the price target on the stock from $35 to $38. Recognizing General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) as one of the leading companies in the auto sector, Jones included it in his list of the ""top 5"" automotive companies.According to Insider Monkey’s Q1 2023 database, 73 hedge funds disclosed long positions in General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), worth roughly $4 billion. Of these, investment firm Harris Associates holds a significant position as a shareholder.6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American multinational consumer goods corporation headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. The company provides branded consumer packaged goods worldwide, operating through Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segments.On April 11, the company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.9407 per share, marking a 3% increase. With this raise, the company extended its impressive streak of dividend growth to 67 years, solidifying its position as not only one of the top dividend aristocrat stocks on our list, but also one of the best forever stock.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), compared to 74 funds in the preceding quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.94 million shares valued at $735.2 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”Much like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a top 'forever' stock finding favor with hedge funds.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Now.

Still, with the larger $69 billion deal back on track, the two sides are now focused on modifying the deal to obtain regulatory approval.Jonathan Compton, partner at law firm DMH Stallard and a specialist in competition law, said it was difficult to see what structural alterations the company could make.""Were it to do so, it could face fresh inquiry from the FTC and or the Commission,"" he said, of the U.S. and EU regulators.Euclid's McGrath added: ""how do you reset the clock just for the CMA process without resetting the clock everywhere?""Britain's competition regulator has not given any further clarification on its U-turn or the new investigation, including whether it would fit into its Phase 1 and 2 process, the latter of which can take up to a year.When CMA top boss Sarah Cardell in April announced the decision to block the deal, she was asked repeatedly if there was any way it could still go ahead.""We have taken a decision to block the deal,"" she had said.

Still, with the larger $69 billion deal back on track, the two sides are now focused on modifying the deal to obtain regulatory approval.Jonathan Compton, partner at law firm DMH Stallard and a specialist in competition law, said it was difficult to see what structural alterations the company could make.""Were it to do so, it could face fresh inquiry from the FTC and or the Commission,"" he said, of the U.S. and EU regulators.Euclid's McGrath added: ""how do you reset the clock just for the CMA process without resetting the clock everywhere?""Britain's competition regulator has not given any further clarification on its U-turn or the new investigation, including whether it would fit into its Phase 1 and 2 process, the latter of which can take up to a year.When CMA top boss Sarah Cardell in April announced the decision to block the deal, she was asked repeatedly if there was any way it could still go ahead.""We have taken a decision to block the deal,"" she had said.(Reporting by Paul Sandle, Muvija M, Martin Coulter, and Amy-Jo Crowley; Editing by Kate Holton and Devika Syamnath)]"

78,22fb1516-c201-3d8d-94be-e5ff42d695ca,SIG,2023-07-12,Martin Marietta Materials and Signet Jewelers have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/martin-marietta-materials-signet-jewelers-111700410.html,1689160620,STORY,"['SIG', 'MLM', 'JBL', 'DFS']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – July 12, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) as the Bull of the Day and Signet Jewelers SIG as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Discover Financial Services DFS, Builders FirstSource BLDR and Jabil JBL.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Martin Marietta Materials is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that produces and supplies construction aggregates and other heavy building materials, mainly cement, in the United States.The stock is trading just below all-time highs as investors see strong demand helping earnings for the next few years. While it is hard to chase a stock like this higher, investors should be watching for opportunistic pullbacks.About the Company Martin Marietta was founded in 1939 and is headquartered in Raleigh, NC. The company offers crushed stone, sand, and gravel products; ready mixed concrete and asphalt; paving products and services; and Portland and specialty cement for use in infrastructure projects, and nonresidential and residential construction markets, as well as in the railroad, agricultural, utility, and environmental industries.The stock has a Zacks Style Score of ""D"" in Value and Momentum. It has a Forward PE of 28 and pays a small dividend of about half a percent. MLM currently employs 9,400 and has a market cap of $27 billion.Q1 Earnings Beat In early May, the company reported a 118% EPS beat. Q1 earnings came in at $2.16 v the $0.99 expected and revenues were $1.35B v the $1.19B expected. Management cited solid near-term product demand as a reason for the big quarter.The company adjusted its FY23 outlook, seeing EBITDA at the higher end of the expected range. They also lifted their revenue outlook to $6.6-6.82B v the $6.27 expected.Management saw healthy customer backlogs across their footprint which was led by infrastructure and heavy nonresidential project of scale. They expect recent legislation and public investment to support demand for several years.Story continuesThe CEO commented, ""We are confident in our ability to continue to expand margins throughout the year and expect to deliver compelling full-year financial results more directionally in line with the high end of our previously announced 2023 guidance range, which we will revisit at mid-year.""The earnings beat was the second quarter in a row after the company reported multiple misses over the last couple years.Analyst Estimates Looking at analyst estimates since earnings, we see longer-term numbers shooting higher, while short-term looks mixed.Looking at the current quarter, have estimates moving 1% higher over the last 90 days. However, for the next quarter, they are going down by almost 2%. While the magnitude of these moves is low, it tells us that analysts might be conservative in their expectations.This idea is backed up when you look at the bigger picture and see longer-term estimates are going higher over the last 90 days.For the current year, analysts have taken numbers from $14.84 to $15.89, or 7%. For next year, we see estimates jump from $17.04 to $18.14, or 6.5%.The TechnicalsThe stock is trading near 52-week highs, which happen to be all-time highs. Understanding that many investors do not like to chase, let us go over possible areas of support.The stock topped at $462 in late June before pulling back to the $440 area where the 21-day MA has shown some support. Below that level, $417 looks to be the 50-day MA support area, and then $380 is the earnings gap fill.If we get a market sell-off, investors can hope for the 200-day MA at $364, but this is unlikely unless aggressive market selling comes in.For those that look for Fibonacci retracements, the $405 level is the halfway back spot, found drawing from the pre-earnings breakout area to recent highs. The 61.8% retracement is $390.Bottom Line While Martine Marietta has had quite the run, there are both technical and fundamental reasons for this.When a stock trades at all-time highs, there is price discovery above, which is what MLM is going through now.On the fundamental side, strong demand led by public investment will be a tailwind for revenues for years. This will keep investors interested and willing buyers to come in on any sell-off.Those interested in the name should watch support levels for buying opportunities and look for MLM to finish off the year strong.Bear of the Day:Signet Jewelers is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is a retailer of diamond jewelry, watches as well as other products.The stock has rallied nicely with the overall market, but investors might be getting ahead of themselves. A recent earnings report showed the company struggled when compared to last year and Same Store Sales (SSS) were off by double digits. Moreover, the company cut the guidance and estimates are falling.About the Company Signet is headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda.The company operates through three segments: North America, International, and Other.Many familiar brands known in the U.S. are Kay Jewelers, Kay Jewelers Outlet, Jared The Galleria Of Jewelry, Jared Vault, Zales Jewelers, Zales Outlet, Diamonds Direct, James Allen, Banter by Piercing Pagoda, and Peoples Jewellers names, as well as operates online through its digital banners, James Allen and Blue Nile.The company is valued at $3.3B and employs 30,000. The stock has a Forward PE of 7 and pays a dividend of 1.3%. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of ""A"" in Value, but ""F"" in Growth and ""D"" in Momentum.Q1 Earnings In early June, Signet reported an earnings beat of 24%. Beating on the bottom line is what the company does, and it has not missed since 2017. But looking closer, the y/y revenue was down to $1.69B from $1.84B last year.The company cut its FY24 outlook and guided for a weak Q2 citing a deceleration of trends and a softer-than-expected Mother's Day.Q2 revenues are expected to come in at a range of $1.53-1.58B v the expected $1.73B. FY24 is now seen at a range of $9.49-$10.09 v the $11.18 expected. SSS were down 13.9% year over year.The stock's immediate reaction was to go lower, but it bounced above some technical resistance levels. After a more than 10% rally, investors might be getting ahead of themselves as estimates continue to march lower.EstimatesOver the last 60 days, analysts have cut estimates for all time-frames.For the current quarter, analysts have dropped their numbers from $2.65 to $1.34, or 49%.For the next quarter, analysts lowered estimates from $1.02 to $0.75, or 26%.Longer term, numbers are falling as well. Next year's estimates have gone from $12.03 to 10.46 or 13%.Technical TakeThe stock market rally has really helped SIG lift higher. However, investors might be getting ahead of themselves as the stock approaches the upper end of its 52-week range. $75 will be a tough nut to crack and the bears will likely step in.The 200-day MA is around the $69 level and will be watched by both sides. A move back under that level and the recent rally could be considered a failure. Signet investors are familiar with that ""failure"" word as the stock has traded from $150 to $6 back to $110 and down to $50 before the 2023 up move.Expect volatile action that will be amplified with any news on earnings.In SummaryLooking back to the last miss in 2017, the stock was at $60. This was right where it was trading before the recent rally. Meaning that while the stock has seen some big volatile moves, there has been no real appreciation in the name despite all the earnings outperformance.Additional content:3 Red-Hot Stocks Suited for Momentum InvestorsBy targeting stocks breaking out to or near new highs, investors can insert themselves in favorable trends where buyers are in control.And as many have learned, stocks breaking out to new highs tend to make even higher highs, especially when they boast favorable near-term earnings outlooks.Three large-cap stocks –Discover Financial Services, Builders FirstSource and Jabil – are all breaking out to or near 52-week highs and sport a favorable Zacks Rank.In addition, all three carry sound valuation levels, with all carrying a Style Score of ""A"" for Value. For value-conscious investors interested in momentum, let's take a closer look at each.Discover Financial ServicesDiscover Financial Services is a digital banking and payment services company in the United States, offering deposit products, credit cards, and personal, student, and home loans. The stock is a Zack Rank #2 (Buy), with the revisions trend particularly notable for its upcoming quarterly release on July 19th.DFS shares presently trade at an 8.8X forward earnings multiple, in line with the five-year median and nicely beneath 2022 highs of 9.6X. The stock carries a Style Score of ""A"" for Value.Further, DFS shares could also attract income-focused investors, with the company's dividend yielding a solid 2.4% annually. Dividend growth is also apparent, with the payout growing by a double-digit 11% over the last five years.Builders FirstSourceBuilders FirstSource, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), supplies building materials, manufactured components, and construction services to professional homebuilders, sub-contractors, remodelers, and consumers. Analysts have raised their expectations across the board and have been in full agreement.The company has consistently surprised in a big way as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by an average of an impressive 70% over its last four quarters. Market participants have been impressed with the results, with shares seeing bullish activity post-earnings in back-to-back releases.JabilJabil provides electronic manufacturing services and solutions to its customers, currently boasting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The revisions trend for its current fiscal year is hard to ignore, with the $8.50 EPS estimate being revised nearly 8% higher since July of last year.JBL shares currently trade at a 13.1X forward earnings multiple, above the five-year median by a few ticks but nicely below the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average. The company also boasts a solid growth profile, with earnings forecasted to climb 11% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 9% in FY24.Further, Jabil's 45.2% trailing twelve-month return on equity (ROE) is certainly worth highlighting, reflecting a higher level of efficiency in generating profits from existing assets.Bottom LineMomentum investing is centered around targeting stocks displaying outperformance. And when you add in the Zacks Rank, the strategy can become even more powerful.And that's precisely what all three stocks above have displayed, breaking out to new 52-week highs on the back of improved earnings outlooks.In addition, all three sport a Style Score of ""A"" for Value.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

These companies have demonstrated their commitment to shareholders by consistently increasing dividends for years.The first stock boasts an impressive 65-year history of dividend increases. The company’s streamlined operations underpin it, focusing on growth markets and anticipating improved demand. In contrast, the second one indicates resilience and positive prospects, with solid sales performance in its U.S. pharmacy and Boots U.K. retail businesses. The third, on the other hand, is a reliable dividend aristocrat with consistent dividend growth. It focuses on risk management and vital investment expansion opportunities.Investing in dividend aristocrats provides investors with a stable and reliable income stream. It also generates the potential for long-term capital appreciation. The article will explore the companies’ solid fundamentals, strategic initiatives, and market resilience. These elements make them attractive options for investors seeking a balance between dividends and growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips3M (MMM)3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stockSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com3M (NYSE:MMM) has a long-standing record of stable dividend growth and a forward yield of 5.99% . Its 65th consecutive year of dividend increases reflects its commitment to delivering value to shareholders.Additionally, 3M’s proactive measures to streamline and simplify operations. It includes eliminating management layers and reducing corporate shared services to enhance efficiency and agility while driving cost savings. Simplifying the supply chain and adopting a division-led model further aligns the company with customers. It also optimizes go-to-market strategies, improving overall operational performance.Further, focusing on high-growth markets and material science innovation positions 3M favorably to capitalize on emerging technological trends. Investments in automotive electrification, personal safety, home improvement, semiconductors, and healthcare align with evolving customer needs and drive revenue growth.Story continuesDespite a fluid macroeconomic environment, 3M anticipates improved demand as economies recover and supply chains heal. The company’s disciplined cost controls and ongoing investments will support a rebound despite adversity. It includes temporarily soft markets such as consumer retail, consumer electronics, and industrial end-markets.Looking ahead, several positive factors suggest a bullish outlook for 3M. The company’s ability to navigate headwinds effectively, better-than-forecasted results, and potential for improved global economic conditions contribute to its resilience. Additionally, improving manufacturing and supply chain operations, working capital management and increased capital expenditures for growth and sustainability enhance efficiency, profitability, and competitive edge.Overall, the strengths in individual business segments, such as organic growth in Safety and Industrial, outperform industry build rates in Transportation and Electronics. Lastly, the expected recovery in healthcare procedure volumes presents further opportunities for growth and market share capture.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) holds a strong lead as a dividend aristocrat with a forward yield of 6.60% and its capital allocation priorities.The company has demonstrated resilience and potential for future growth despite the challenges. Additionally, it has solid sales performance, particularly in its U.S. pharmacy and Boots U.K. retail businesses. It reflects its ability to adapt to changing market trends and capture market share. WBA’s robust sales growth, exceeding expectations and outperforming its plan, showcases its market strength. With its continued script growth and brand inflation, the U.S. pharmacy business is expected to maintain positive momentum. Meanwhile, the Boots U.K. retail business has shown impressive comp sales growth. It also gained market share across all categories, aided by successful product launches.Further, the scaling healthcare business presents a significant opportunity for WBA’s future profitability, with sales doubling from the previous year. The expansion of VillageMD clinics and adding new health system partners for Shields demonstrate a strong growth trajectory. Although challenges in the respiratory season affected CityMD visits and Summit Health referrals, WBA anticipates improvement in the fourth quarter.Despite revising its adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2023 due to a cautious consumer outlook and the impact of COVID-19, WBA maintains promising long-term prospects. Also, the U.S. retail pharmacy segment is projected to achieve low single-digit sales growth, the international segment is anticipated to grow 6% to 8% on a constant currency basis, and the healthcare business is expected to continue its growth trajectory.Overall, WBA’s strategic initiatives demonstrate its commitment to enhancing financial performance, including cost management programs, portfolio optimization, and leveraging technology. However, the company’s focus on disciplined returns-based organic investment and debt reduction sets the stage for sustainable growth and improved shareholder value.Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) has an impressive track record as a dividend aristocrat, having increased its dividend for over 25 consecutive years.

In Q1 2023, it reported solid results, including approximately $1.7 billion of high-quality investments acquired at a cash cap rate of 7%. This represents a 90 basis point increase compared to the previous quarter, highlighting the company’s ability to access well-priced capital and secure favorable investment opportunities. The investment spread of 163 basis points, above historical averages, further demonstrates the effectiveness of Realty Income’s investment strategy.Also, Realty Income’s focus on diversification and risk management is another positive factor. With a portfolio occupancy rate of 99%, the company exhibits stability and a strong ability to generate durable cash flows. Additionally, its emphasis on industry-leading clients operating in low-priced service-based or non-discretionary industries contributes to a resilient earnings profile. The commitment to rigorous credit underwriting and high-quality real estate locations further enhances the company’s risk management approach.Moreover, Realty Income has increased its 2023 investment guidance to over $6 billion, reflecting a significant expansion compared to previous projections. A robust deal pipeline and favorable pricing spread for large portfolio transactions support this growth.

Embers from a smoldering scrap wood fire set days before on a nearby property used by a Christian religious communal group was also found to have been another cause.The two fires combined to cause a blaze fanned by high winds that is blamed for causing $2 billion in damage in a suburban area between Denver and Boulder.In response to the allegations, Xcel re-issued a statement first given in response to the results the fire investigation, saying that it strongly objected to its findings.“We strongly disagree with any suggestion that Xcel Energy’s power lines caused the second ignition, which according to the report started 80 to 110 feet away from Xcel Energy’s powerlines in an area with underground coal fire activity,"" it said.More than 150 insurance companies allege in the lawsuit that Xcel, which operates in eight states in the Midwest and West, failed to properly design, construct, inspect, maintain, repair or operate its electrical equipment before the Marshall Fire broke out on Dec. 30, 2021. The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, said Xcel failed to de-energize its electrical equipment before the onset of strong winds.The American Property Casualty Insurance Association, a trade group for insurance companies, said the lawsuit is part of a normal process known as subrogation that seeks to recover expenses from those found to be at fault in causing damage.“Subrogation is a common process in insurance claims where insurers seek to recover money paid to policyholders from the responsible party, which is an important tool to help keep insurance costs affordable for policyholders,” Karen Collins, an assistant vice president for the group, said in a statement.Story continuesThe smoldering fire at the Twelve Tribes property that was also blamed for sparking one of the fires that became the Marshall Fire had been buried by residents a few days before in a way that was approved by firefighters who stopped by to investigate, Boulder County Sheriff Curtis Johnson said at a news conference last month.The lawsuit points out that the official report found that the group's plan to manage their fire was “responsible” and that the fire, when stirred up by winds on Dec. 30, did not quickly spread because of factors including the property's topography and lack of ground fuels.In contrast, the lawsuit accused Xcel of failing to do business in a reasonable way. It also says the fire sparked by its power line spread quickly because it was on top of a flat mesa, allowing the fire to spread along the ground, and ignited nearby vegetation. The lawsuit claims “firebrands” — flaming or glowing fuel particles carried by the wind — from the power line-ignited fire sparked spot fires that eventually spread and burned homes in the communities of Louisville and Superior.In its statement, Xcel said it reviewed its maintenance records and believes the system was properly maintained.A lawsuit by businesses and residents was filed last year against Xcel Energy, and two other residents fled a lawsuit against Xcel on Monday. More lawsuits are expected to be filed, which lawyers hope to have considered by the same judge._____This story has been changed to correct the spelling of Karen Collins' last name.]"

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Archer-Daniels-Midland's (NYSE:ADM) returns on capital, so let's have a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Archer-Daniels-Midland is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$4.4b ÷ (US$59b - US$23b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Archer-Daniels-Midland has an ROCE of 12%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Food industry average of 9.7% it's much better. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland roceIn the above chart we have measured Archer-Daniels-Midland's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Archer-Daniels-Midland here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWe like the trends that we're seeing from Archer-Daniels-Midland. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 12%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 30%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.Our Take On Archer-Daniels-Midland's ROCETo sum it up, Archer-Daniels-Midland has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 93% return over the last five years. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesOne more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Archer-Daniels-Midland and understanding this should be part of your investment process.While Archer-Daniels-Midland isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

To skip our analysis of the recent trends, and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Potash Stocks to Buy.Potash refers to a group of different minerals and chemical compositions that bear the potassium element in substantial quantities. The potassium chloride compound, known commonly as the muriate of potash accounts for the majority of the global potash market with other compounds such as sulphate of potash accounting for the rest.More than 95% of the global potash production is utilized for agricultural purposes with the remaining amount employed for manufacturing commercial and industrial products such as detergents. According to the US Geological Survey, Russia and Belarus combined have accounted for a third of the global potash supply over the years.The Russia-Ukraine conflict and resulting sanctions led to pressures on the global potash supply chain. The list of other leading potash producing countries includes Canada, China, and Germany, among others. You can read more about the leading potash producing countries in our article, 15 Largest Potash Producing Countries in the World.In addition to Phosphorus and Nitrogen, Potash is among the three most important nutrients for optimal crop health and production. These elements, together known as ‘NPK’, are the only macronutrients required by plants for healthy growth. Even though these resources are naturally available in soil, excessive and repetitive farming reduces their quantities in the soil at a pace much faster than the time required for their natural replenishment. This necessitates the need for synthetically produced fertilizers.In the aftermath of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the prices for potash increased manifold all across the world. Potassium Chloride prices hit their peak in April 2022 as they exceeded $1200 per metric ton. The prices have since dropped significantly and were recorded at $328 per metric ton which is still higher than the Covid-era prices, according to data from the World Bank.Story continuesSeveral countries including the United States have taken measures to reduce their reliance on Russia and Belarus for their fertilizer imports. For instance, Brazil chose Canada as an alternate source for its potash requirements while Morocco opted for Egypt and Saudi Arabia as alternatives for its ammonia requirements. United States announced grants focused on increasing local production of fertilizers. You can read more about this in our recent article, 10 Best Fertilizer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Some of the best potash stocks to buy include The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) – a leading American producer of potash, Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) – a leading American diversified agricultural services company, and Nutrien Ltd.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: JPMorgan Chase JPM, Citigroup C, Transdigm Group TDG, Copart CPRT and Lennar LEN.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Major U.S. Banks Report: Global Week AheadIn the Global Week Ahead, tensions between the political capitals of Washington DC and Beijing remain a focus.In terms of macro, U.S. consumer price inflation (CPI) data will critically update the FOMC. The CPI data lands on Wednesday.At mid-week, monetary policy rate-setters in New Zealand and Canada meet.Next are Reuters' five world market themes, reordered for equity traders—(1) U.S. Major Bank Reports Kick Off Q2 Earnings SeasonU.S. banking giants sailed through the Fed's annual health check in late June, highlighting they have enough capital to weather a severe economic downturn.But now it's time for earnings, with JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup scheduled to report second quarter earnings on July 14th.The picture looks not so rosy with results predicted to be weighed down by sluggish dealmaking and trading revenue while a dearth of investment-banking activity has prompted banks to lay off thousands of employees.Meanwhile, the largest U.S. lenders are expected to keep tightening credit standards given the uncertain economic environment, particularly after bank failures earlier this year.Analysts focus on banks' lending outlook and how much they set aside in rainy-day funds to cushion losses from souring loans.(2) Traders Now Accept ""Higher for Longer""Markets have come around fast to the Fed's view that instead of being cut anytime soon, rates will remain high for longer.After another brutal bond sell off, focus turns to Wednesday's U.S. inflation data. Price pressures have been easing but perhaps not fast enough with a July rate hike seen as likely.Story continuesMay CPI data showed the smallest year-on-year increase since March 2021 — but at 4%, that was still well above the Fed's 2% target. Just like the latest personal consumption expenditures index showed similarly slowing inflation also above the Fed's comfort zone.June meeting minutes showed a united Fed agreed to hold rates steady, buy time and assess whether further hikes would be needed. The answer seems yes.And the most deeply inverted bond yield curve since the 1980s suggests investors bracing for another hike also expect Fed tightening raises recession risks.(3) Debt-laden Firms — Around the World — Running into TroubleDebt-laden companies are running into trouble:·         Embattled French retailer Casino (CASP), with 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) of debt maturing in the next two years, has until end-July to agree a restructuring plan·         Britain's Thames Water, with 14 billion pounds of borrowings, faces temporary state ownership if it can't raise fresh capital·         Sweden's commercial landlord SBB is fighting for survivalIn the U.S., junk-rated companies have to refinance almost $1.2 trillion of borrowings by 2026, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings.At the same time, the market for collateralized loan obligations — vehicles formed by specialist asset managers that buy about 60% of all junk-rated loans and package them up into bonds — has almost shuddered to a halt.Stock market valuations do not reflect any credit-related worries yet — but that may just be the eye of a storm.(4) Capitals of Beijing and DC Fight High-Tech Trade WarChina is fighting a hi-tech trade war with Washington while grappling with a sputtering economy.After months of tightening of restrictions by the U.S. and key allies on chip-related imports, Beijing hit back in recent days with curbs on chip-making metal exports, and a warning of more to come — just in time for Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's visit.Washington has been mulling curbing Chinese companies' access to cloud-computing services.Things aren't looking bright on the economic front, either. Monday's inflation data should show more deflationary pressure at factories and retailers, while Thursday's trade numbers are expected to see a continued decline in exports — all pointing to lackluster demand.Hopes for major Politburo policy support at month-end seem to have faded. Goldman Sachs said that conversations with their local clients showed they now expected to see measures aimed only at easing economic headwinds, rather than generating strong growth.(5) On Wednesday, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) and the Bank of Canada (BoC) Give Supply UpdatesSkips, pauses and pivots dominate monetary policy conversations as persistent inflation has seemingly consigned central-bank forward guidance to the dustbin of history.Increasingly, policymakers say decisions depend on future data, making it harder for traders to formulate a view on the outlook.The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) — one of the first major central banks to start tightening policy — has raised rates by 525 basis points since October 2021 - the most among the G10.In May, it signaled it had finished raising rates, but at its meeting on Wednesday longer-term clarity may remain out of reach with inflation running at 6.7% and the economy in recession.The Bank of Canada, meeting the same day, is in the data-dependent corner, leaving markets split down the middle on whether it will raise or pause.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks(1) Transdigm Group : This Aerospace and Defense company's stock prices at a whopping $879. There is a current market cap of $48.3B.I see a Zacks Value score of F, a Zacks Growth score of F, and a Zacks Momentum score of D.Incepted in 1993, TransDigm Group is a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly-engineered aerospace components that used in commercial and military aircraft.The company, through its well-diversified business, offers a broad range of products to its customers.TransDigm currently has four reportable segments:The Airframe segment produces systems and components like engineered latching and locking devices, security components and systems, aircraft audio systems, specialized lavatory components, seat belts and safety restraints, engineered interior surfaces and related components, military personnel parachutes and cargo delivery systems.

Each Esterline reporting unit is included in one of TransDigm's segments.(2) Copart: This is a $89 stock, in the Auction and Valuation Services industry.This company's stock currently has a market cap of $42.5B.I see a Zacks Value score of F, a Zacks Growth score of B, and a Zacks Momentum score of D.Based in Dallas, TX, Copart was founded in 1982.The company provides online auction and a wide range of remarketing services to process and sell salvage and clean title vehicles.This is done mainly over the Internet, through its Virtual Bidding Third Generation (VB3) Internet auction-style sales technology.Sellers are primarily insurance companies, banks and financial institutions, charities, car dealerships, fleet operators, and vehicle rental companies.Buyers include licensed vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle dealers and exporters, along with the general public.Copart's services include online supplier access, salvage estimation services, end-of-life vehicle processing, virtual insured exchange, transportation services, vehicle inspection stations, on-demand reporting, DMV processing and flexible vehicle processing programs, among others.The company primarily has two revenue  streams: service revenue and purchased vehicles.Copart derives service revenues from vehicle sales when it acts as an intermediary. In such cases, the firm doesn't take ownership of the vehicle.

90,0e033e46-5c42-3cc0-b115-77fb95ac6afb,HCA,2023-07-12,"Cava is 'overpriced,' Uber a 'zombie stock': Strategist's winners and losers",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/cava-overpriced-uber-zombie-stock-200626060.html,1689105986,VIDEO,"['CAVA', 'UBER', 'HCA', 'DFS']","[Cava and Uber shares have been on the rise, but New Constructs CEO David Trainer isn't a fan, arguing both are overvalued. When it comes to stocks he likes, Trainer tells Yahoo Finance Live why he is buying Discover Financial and HCA Healthcare.Video Transcript- Well, stocks edging higher as traders count down to the next inflation report. But with earnings season just around the corner, we're taking a look at some stocks to consider buying and some to avoid. Here to discuss, we want to bring in new Constructs CEO, David Trainer. David, it's great to see you again. I want to start with one of your sell picks, and that's Cava. And just a couple of weeks ago or several weeks ago, I should say, we got your thoughts on the company before it went public. I want to play real quick what you had to say then about Cava.DAVID TRAINER: We think Cava is the next WeWork. We don't think this IPO should actually ever happen. This is a ruse to trick unsuspecting retail investors into buying what is a terrible business. It's burning cash flow, its cash flow is only going to get worse, and we think the only reason this company is deciding to IPO in this environment because if they can't get an IPO done now, they never will because the cash flow burn is going to get even worse.- David investors, though, have been interested in the name. The stock is still at just around double its IPO price. I'm guessing you haven't changed your stance. Why?- No. I mean, this is just sort of almost a replay of the IPOs from 2021 that came out and doubled, and then soon, you know-- soon thereafter fell 90-plus percent. Look, the valuation implies that the company's margins will go from very negative today to where Chipotle's margins are and grow-- at the same time, grow at 25% compounded annually for the next 10 years. That's about what the company has to do to justify 45 bucks a share.And by the way, Chipotle didn't even grow at 25% compounded annually for its first 10 years. It only did around 20%, 22%. So this is priced to be bigger and better and more profitable than Chipotle. And so I mean, what can I say? All the good news is priced in and in the backdrop of the fact that it's burning a lot of cash, they needed this IPO to keep from going bankrupt. You know, I guess I'll stop there.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: Well, David, I mean, what does that tell you, though, about where this current market is? If we're seeing investors chasing a stock that you say is basically bleeding money, not on the track to profitability, what does that tell you about where the mindset is?- Oh, I mean, I think it's pretty clear. We're in a risk-off kind of mindset. I mean, we're chasing Nvidia up, huge amounts and a lot of junk stocks, meme stocks have been flying, Rivian's flying. You know, look, there's a lot of liquidity, there's a lot of federal stimulus, trillions of dollars of federal stimulus that have been poured into this economy since COVID, and a lot of that's just flowed straight into speculative trading and that spells bad news for investors who, you know, don't really know how to time it.And look, I don't-- I don't like to pretend that timing is a good strategy at all, I'm just here to, you know, recognize that obviously the stock's gone up a lot. You know, and if you were in it early, you've done well. The question is, when will it come back to Earth? And I don't want to be around when it does.- Well, David, another name that investors have been chasing since the start of this year is Uber. We've seen the stock rise just about 80% since the start of January. You're still not sold on this name. You're actually naming it as one of your zombies stock picks. Why don't you see maybe a more optimistic outlook here, given some of the improvement that Uber has seen over the last several months?- Yeah, no, look, I mean, I'm not going to say that the business isn't getting better, but you have to reconcile that with what the valuation says about what the business will do, right? So our approach is to do-- to use a reverse discounted cash flow model that quantifies the future performance needed to justify the stock price. So we can say, OK, well, if 45 bucks for Uber means that the company's got to go from a negative 5% margin to positive 5% while simultaneously growing revenues at 35% compounded annually for a decade, that's probably fully pretty expensive, right?You know, and that would imply that its ride share-- Uber's share of the ride share market would be something like over 100% at that kind of revenue growth rate. You know, so the valuation just doesn't make sense. This is not to say that Uber is a bad business, it's not a great business. It's cash flow burning has been for a long time, which is why it's a zombie stock. But even if something is a good business. That doesn't mean it's a good stock.- Let's talk about stocks that you do like. Arguably less sexy names, right, we're not talking about Cava and Uber, but Discover Financial Services-- what do you like there?- Great underwriting, very cheap valuation. When we first named that to our long idea list, I think the stock price implied that profits were going to-- were going to decline by 50%. Notice the nice juxtaposition, right? Profits for Cava and Uber are expected to climb astronomically. Discover's priced today still as if profits will decline by 40% permanently.So really nice cheap valuation with very strong cash flow, again, different from Uber and Cava, Discover's actually generating real cash flow and they've got great underwriting. So their loan losses and delinquencies are looking better than peers. So we think that the cash flow is going to continue. And if the stock price recognizes that, there's a lot of upside.- Another name that you do see upside with is HCA Healthcare. Lay out the bull case there.- Look, it's a very defensive industry. And HCA is one of the most profitable and successful hospital chains in America. Demand for services are still growing. It's been able to adapt and maintain a higher return on invested capital than its peers. And we still like the valuation, it's gotten a little rich on us here and-- because it's been a great performer since it's been on our long idea list.And so it's one of the just better stocks out there, again, generating huge amount of cash flow, reasonable valuation, strong long-term demand and tailwinds. We think it's a much better stock to be in, of course, than Uber and Cava.- New Constructs CEO David Trainer. It's always good to get your perspective here. Appreciate your time today.- Thank you.]"

A file dumped online by the hacker on Monday following what appeared to be a failed attempt to extort HCA includes nearly 1 million records from the company's San Antonio division.If 11 million patients are affected, the breach would rank in the top five as reported by health care institutions to the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights. In the worst such hack, affecting the medical insurer Anthem Inc. in 2015, 79 million people. Chinese spies were indicted in that case and there no evidence the stolen data was ever put up for sale.The hacker, who first posted a sample of stolen data online on July 5, was trying to sell the data and was apparently attempting to extort HCA. They claimed to have 27.7 million records and set a Monday deadline.A company spokesman did not immediately respond to an email and phone message asking if HCA received an extortion demand.In a statement posted to its website on Monday, HCA said the data was stolen from “an external storage location” used to “automate the formatting of email messages.” HCA did not say when the data was stolen or when it learned of the theft.The company said it would offer credit monitoring and identity theft protection “where appropriate.” It cautioned that patients should be wary of phone calls, emails and text messages.Story continuesHCA listed facilities in 20 U.S. states from Alaska to Virginia where people who received services might be affected.In addition to hospitals, HCA Healthcare runs 2,300 ambulatory sites including surgery and urgent care centers and free-standing emergency rooms. It reports treating 37 million patients annually.Health care is classified by the U.S. government as one of 16 critical infrastructure sectors, and health care providers are seen as prime targets for hackers.]"

Recently, HCA crossed above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.The 20-day simple moving average is a popular investing tool. Traders like this SMA because it offers a look back at a stock's price over a shorter period and helps smooth out price fluctuations. The 20-day can also show more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.Like other SMAs, if a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.HCA could be on the verge of another rally after moving 7.1% higher over the last four weeks.

95,5c769c20-7f94-31f2-bdf3-2d9221c3a3d2,HCA,2023-07-12,5 Dividend Stocks With Strong Growth Prospects,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-dividend-stocks-strong-growth-120700266.html,1689077220,STORY,"['DRI', 'HCA', 'MCHP', 'TOL']","[After a strong first half, Wall Street lost its momentum as rate hike fears returned. Markets are speculating that the Fed will raise interest rates in its meeting later this month, making investors jittery. In such a scenario, dividend investing seems the best choice as it offers consistent and safe income.Though the strategy does not offer dramatic price appreciation, it is a major source of consistent income for investors in any market. In particular, focusing on the growth level in this strategy leads to higher returns. Stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio, with a greater scope of capital appreciation, as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields.We have selected five dividend stocks — Toll Brothers TOL, Darden Restaurants Inc. DRI, Caterpillar Inc. CAT, Microchip Technology Incorporated MCHP and HCA Healthcare Inc. HCA — that possess strong growth prospects.Dividend Growth: Why a Win Strategy?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environments.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 15.Here are five of the 15 stocks that fit the bill:Pennsylvania-based Toll Brothers builds single-family detached and attached home communities, master-planned luxury residential resort-style golf communities, and urban low, mid, and high-rise communities, principally on the land it develops and improves. TOL saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 25 cents over the past 30 days for the fiscal year (ending October 2023) and has an expected earnings growth rate of 6.7%Toll Brothers has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B.

The company saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 14 cents over the past 30 days for this year, with an estimated growth rate of 25.8%.CAT has a Zacks Rank #2 and Growth Score of B.Arizona-based Microchip Technology is engaged in developing and manufacturing microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks.

This reduction became evident toward the end of May and persisted throughout the quarter in North America, Latin America and EMEA. The company's shares experienced a decline of 11% as a result of the revised guidance.The stock has lost 11.5% in the past year against the industry’s rise of 13.5% in the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor the second quarter, FMC now expects revenues to range between $1-$1.03 billion, representing a decrease compared with the earlier guidance of $1.42-$1.48 billion. Adjusted EBITDA for the same period is projected in the range of $185-$190 million, indicating a decline from the previous guidance of $350-$370 million.Looking at the full-year outlook, the company has adjusted its financial expectations to reflect the current market conditions. Revenues are now anticipated in the range of $5.20-$5.40 billion compared with the previous guidance of $6.08-$6.22 billion. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year is expected between $1.30-$1.40 billion from the earlier guidance of $1.50-$1.56 billion.These adjustments consider various factors, including the impact of reduced volumes resulting from the inventory reduction by channel partners. However, it is important to note that the consumption of FMC's products on the ground remains robust and comparable to the previous year, providing a positive indication of ongoing demand.Despite the challenges faced, the company remains dedicated to effectively managing the situation.

A slew of other regional banks will also report in the coming weeks.Some of the biggest US banks are expected to once again demonstrate their resilience and diversity, showing they can continue to charge more for their loans while leaning on their sprawling franchises to generate additional revenue.Story continuesJPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America are all expected to show jumps in net income when compared to the year-earlier period, according to analyst estimates, while Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley are expected to report profit declines.JPMorgan's headquarters in New York City. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Those that are more dependent on investment banking, such as Goldman, are expected to be particularly challenged by a recent drought in deal making.Global investment banking revenues for the second quarter fell by 8% from the first quarter and 52% from a year ago, according to Dealogic. However, the business improved through the second half of the quarter, prompting some observers to predict “green shoots” ahead.“I’m turning to believing investment banking will not have great earnings but they’re going to be surprising, and I think better than expected,” said Dick Bove, a bank analyst with Odeon Capital.Investors will also be watching to see whether many of these big banks increase the amounts they set aside for future loan losses, a sign that they expect the US economy and credit conditions to worsen.“We're starting to see some increased delinquencies, particularly in the credit card and auto lending market,” said Biggar, Argus Research's director of financial services.'A huge amount of problems'Smaller regional banks are clearly not under the same amount of pressure as they were in March, when the fall of Silicon Valley Bank triggered panic across the country.But they still “face a huge amount of problems,” Bove said.The core issue is an aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to bring down inflation with higher interest rates. That campaign is lowering the value of the assets banks hold, such as bonds, while deposit costs creep higher and loan demand slows.Read more: Why now is a good time to open a savings account“We view accelerating deposit costs, not accelerating deposit outflows, as the most significant headwind to earnings for the next several quarters,“ Manan Gosalia, a regional bank analyst for Morgan Stanley, said in a research note.Higher rates have traditionally worked to the advantage of banks since it allows them to charge more for their loans than their deposits.But the panic of the spring “has changed the calculus a bit” for some banks, the Fed’s vice chair of supervision Michael Barr said Monday. Some lenders “are now paying up more for deposits,” and the Fed is “paying careful attention to that.”Silicon Valley Bank was seized on March 10. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The Fed has made it clear that more hikes are coming this year. Regulators are also preparing new capital requirements for banks with more than $100 billion in assets that will force some to hold greater buffers against losses. That will increase the stability of those lenders but will also make it even more difficult to earn robust profits in the near term.Many banks have already warned at a conference in June that their net interest margins are going to drop by more than they expected for the quarter or the year, including executives for US Bancorp (USB), Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Comerica (CMA), Huntington (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), and Zions (ZION).“I’ve only been a banker for 10 years, so I haven’t seen a time when we’ve needed deposits as an industry as much as we do now,” Darrin Williams, the CEO of the 58-branch Southern Bancorp, told Yahoo Finance.The amount Southern Bancorp is paying customers has risen 600% since the Fed’s interest rate hiking cycle began, Williams added.“Our cost of funds continues to rise just because our customers demand that.”The larger banks aren’t immune to some of these same challenges.“Deposits will continue the trend of being slightly down from here,” Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase's massive consumer and community bank, said at a conference in June.The bank has predicted it will earn net interest income of $84 billion in 2023, but if the deposit pressure keeps up, that figure could experience a “mild reprice,” she said.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Schlumberger with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Schlumberger Schlumberger's Improving ProfitsOver the last three years, Schlumberger has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Impressively, Schlumberger's EPS catapulted from US$1.49 to US$2.71, over the last year. It's not often a company can achieve year-on-year growth of 82%. The best case scenario? That the business has hit a true inflection point.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The music to the ears of Schlumberger shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 13% to 15% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Schlumberger's forecast profits?Story continuesAre Schlumberger Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Schlumberger, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$183m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Is Schlumberger Worth Keeping An Eye On?Schlumberger's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering Schlumberger for a spot on your watchlist. You still need to take note of risks, for example - Schlumberger has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Although Schlumberger certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

102,1d208f14-d848-3be2-b7a4-659e9279b235,SLB,2023-07-12,Is Trending Stock Schlumberger Limited (SLB) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-schlumberger-limited-slb-130007988.html,1689080407,STORY,['SLB'],"[Schlumberger (SLB) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned +14% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.7% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, to which Schlumberger belongs, has gained 11.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.71 per share, indicating a change of +42% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.01 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +38.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.74 indicates a change of +24.3% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Schlumberger is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate of $8.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.9%. The $33.36 billion and $37.13 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +18.8% and +11.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $7.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +29.8%. EPS of $0.63 for the same period compares with $0.34 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.18%. The EPS surprise was +3.28%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

103,c9172a54-3afe-3b7a-a0f8-d9c97f404013,APTV,2023-07-12,Monday.com and Macy's have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/monday-com-macys-highlighted-zacks-120900158.html,1689077340,STORY,"['M', 'APTV']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – July 11, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Monday.com MNDY as the Bull of the Day and Macy's M as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Aptiv APTV, Newmont NEM and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Monday.com is a no-code productivity software that provides a platform for team collaboration and project management. It offers customizable features and tools to streamline workflows, improve productivity, and facilitate effective communication within organizations.MNDY is a rapidly growing, high margin technology stock that has the potential to offer exceptionally strong returns. In addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) boosting near term expectations, monday.com stock also boasts a compelling technical trade setup.Upward Trending Earnings EstimatesEarnings estimates for monday.com have been revised dramatically higher over the last two months and now project positive earnings for the first time in the business' history.Current quarter expectations have been upgraded from -$0.22 per share to $0.14 per share and are forecast to climb 142% YoY. FY23 earnings estimates have been boosted from -$0.39 per share all the way to $0.58 per share and are expected to grow 180% YoY.With management now focusing on running a net profitable enterprise investors can sit comfortably as the 88% gross margins begin to produce considerable earnings.Sales at MNDY are forecast to grow very fast as well, with current quarter sales expected to increase 37% YoY, and FY23 sales set to climb 36% YoY.Technical SetupMNDY has been forming one of the cleanest stage one breakout patterns I have seen in some time. After getting hammered lower during the bear market of 2022, monday.com built out a 14-month base from which it may launch higher from.With a very tight consolidation forming over the last few weeks, investors have a compelling risk-reward setup to trade off. If the price of MNDY stock can trade above the $168 level on above average volume, it could send the stock much higher. Alternatively, if the price trades below $158, the setup is invalid, and investors may want to wait for another opportunity.Story continuesValuationMNDY is currently trading at a one-year forward sales multiple of 10.2x, which is above the market average of 4x, and just above its two-year median of 9.8x. This is a premium valuation based on any measurement, but when you have the growth and business economics of monday.com investors are forced to pay up.Additionally, at the current level, it is well below its 2021 highs of 48x sales, which demonstrates just how frothy the market was at that time.Bottom LineMonday.com is a hyper-growth business with a set of convincing variables writing a bullish narrative. Whether you are a trader looking for a quick profit opportunity or, an investor planning to hold for the long-term, monday.com fits the bill across the investment spectrum.Bear of the Day:Macy's has been struggling to find its footing for years following the explosion of e-commerce options, and it doesn't look like it will be improving any time soon.The top and bottom lines of the struggling retailer have experienced YoY declines in the trailing twelve months, and both are nearly flat over the last decade.While Macy's is currently trading near its cheapest valuation in more than 10 years, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), reflecting falling earnings estimates, and an unclear path forward make it a stock investors should avoid.Plummeting Earnings EstimatesWhile M battles to remain relevant in a rapidly shifting retail environment, it also faces macro headwinds adding to an even more grim setup. Waning consumer confidence and a pull back in household spending have led analysts to further downgrade sales and earnings expectations.Current quarter earnings estimates have been cut by a brutal -84% over the last two months and are expected to fall -88% YoY. FY23 earnings expectations have been downgraded by -21.6% and are forecast to decline -35% YoY.Current quarter sales are projected to fall -9.3% YoY and FY23 sales are set to decline 6% YoY.ValuationMacy's is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 5.4x, which is below the industry average of 7.6x, and below its 10-year median of 8.5x. While this does present a considerable historical discount, the business faces a tremendous uphill battle to growing sales and earnings.Bottom LineWhile Macy's seems unable to end its slow demise, it isn't from lack of trying. Its recent three-year makeover, called the Polaris strategy has created a number of innovations to better adapt to the changing retail landscape.Backstage locations, Vendor Direct, Store Pickup and Loyalty Program as well as a focus on products where the business has a foothold like jewelry and fragrances are all attempts to gain momentum. However, trying isn't enough and the retail sector continues to play catchup with the e-commerce industry.Additional content:3 Large-Cap Stocks Seeing Recent UpgradesLarge-cap stocks are a staple in almost every portfolio. They are well-established, have more analyst coverage, and frequently pay dividends, all undeniably significant benefits that make them so popular among investors.And recently, three large-cap stocks – Aptiv, Newmont and Advanced Micro Devices – have all seen favorable upgrades from analysts.Let's take a closer look at each.AptivAptiv is a designer and manufacturer of vehicle components and provides electrical, electronic, and safety technology solutions to the global automotive market. BofA Securities upgraded APTV shares to buy from neutral, with a $140 per share price target.The company's quarterly results have consistently come in above expectations as of late, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations in three consecutive quarters. Just in its latest release, APTV delivered a modest EPS surprise and reported revenue nearly 7% ahead of expectations.Keep an eye out for the company's upcoming release expected in early August; the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate of $1.00 indicates a 350% improvement in earnings from the year-ago period. Analysts have been bullish, with the quarterly estimate being revised 5% higher since April.In addition, Aptiv is projected to witness significant growth, with earnings forecasted to climb 27% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 37% in FY24. Top line growth is also apparent, with sales forecasted to climb 10% and 12% in FY23 and FY24, respectively.NewmontBarclays upgraded NEM shares to overweight from equal-weight, with a $61 per share price target. The company has enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions across the board, helping land the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares could entice value-conscious investors, further reflected by the Style Score of ""B"" for Value. Shares presently trade at an 18.2X forward earnings multiple, well beneath the 23.1X five-year median and highs of 26.7X in 2022.And for those with an appetite for income, NEM shares provide precisely that; shares currently yield a solid 3.8% annually, with the company's payout growing by an impressive 40% over the last five years.Advanced Micro DevicesNorthfield Capital Markets upgraded AMD shares to outperform from market perform, with a price target of $150 per share. The stock has been a big-time outperformer year-to-date amid the tech rally, with shares up more than 70%.Shares are trading near their 50-day moving average, a level that's been primarily respected in past instances.It's worth noting that value-focused investors may not find AMD shares enticing, with the current 40.0X forward earnings multiple residing on the higher end of the spectrum. Still, market participants have had little issue forking up the premium given the company's established nature in a critical industry.Bottom LineLarge-cap stocks are found in nearly every portfolio, as they provide a solid level of defense and carry an established nature.And recently, all three above have seen favorable upgrades among analysts.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

DVA scaled a new 52-week high of $104.72 on Jul 10, before closing the session slightly lower at $103.69.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 22.7% against the 7.1% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 15.2% growth in the said time frame.Over the past five years, the company registered earnings growth of 12.9% compared with the industry’s 5.9% rise. The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 14.6% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 10.5%. DaVita’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 17.3%.DaVita is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its strength in its DaVita Kidney Care. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and the acquisition of dialysis centers are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding dependence on commercial payers and integration risks persist.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversDaVita Kidney Care: Investors are optimistic about DaVita Kidney Care, the major revenue-generating segment of DVA. It specializes in a broad array of dialysis services, significantly contributing to the company's top line. With respect to DaVita’s Integrated Kidney Care, as of Mar 31, 2023, the company had approximately 67,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements, representing approximately $5.2 billion in annualized medical spend. DaVita also had an additional 15,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements.Acquisition of Dialysis Centers: Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate dialysis centers as well as other ancillary services is DaVita’s preferred business strategy. These strategies have boosted the company’s top line to a large extent, raising investors’ optimism.As of Mar 31, 2023, DaVita provided dialysis services to around 246,000 patients at 3,058 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,707 were U.S. centers while 351 were located across 11 other countries. During the first quarter of 2023, the company opened a total of three new dialysis centers in the United States. It also opened three dialysis centers outside the United States in the same period.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: DaVita’s solid first-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company registered an uptick in its overall top line and both segments during the period. DaVita also recorded an increase in total U.S. dialysis treatments during the quarter.DownsidesDependence on Commercial Payers: A significant portion of DaVita’s dialysis and related lab services’ revenues are generated from patients who have commercial payers as the primary payers. The payments received from commercial payers are the primary generators of profit. However, there remains a risk of people shifting from commercial insurance schemes to government schemes due to the wide disparity in payment rates in case of a rise in unemployment.Integration Risks: DaVita’s business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of dialysis centers and other businesses, as well as entry into joint ventures. The company may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions or expand into new business models, which may affect its operations.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, HealthEquity, Inc. HQY and Boston Scientific Corporation BSX.Hologic, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 5.1% for fiscal 2024.

108,b73808e3-007c-3907-83ba-4884b26c9799,NFLX,2023-07-12,Netflix 'has the strength' to gain ad market share: MNTN CEO,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/netflix-strength-gain-ad-market-155619314.html,1689090979,VIDEO,['NFLX'],"[Investors were initially skeptical of Netflix's new ad tier, but early data suggests customers haven't been put off by it. MNTN CEO Mark Douglas tells Yahoo Finance Live why Netflix may succeed with an ad tier, but other streamers may not.Video Transcript- When it comes to Netflix, if we can switch gears to Netflix, when the streamer rolled out, its new tier-based pricing system investors were skeptical about the positive impact that it could have on the company. New data from antenna suggests that consumers have not been put off by advertisements. Daily sign-ups to the streaming company have reached an average of 73,000, while cancellations also saw an increase by 25%. So what can investors take away from this? Will other streaming platforms adopt more tiered pricing systems and include more advertisements?Mountain CEO, Mark Douglas, is back to discuss more here. So what do you think is the kind of net out of this? And the tiered pricing strategy that has moved forward, is it a zero sum game or is it kind of a rising tide type of game?MARK DOUGLAS: No, it's a zero-sum game. So the brand advertising business, we're talking brand television advertising, in the US that's about a $70 billion market. Worldwide, I think it's something like in the $160 billion range. It's a zero-sum game, it is not growing. Growth rates for these big brand advertisers literally are about 1% annually. So for Netflix to gain market share or anyone else to gain market share, someone has to lose. It has to come from another broadcaster.And so the Netflix has the strength, meaning that they have the user base for it, they have the shows for it, the kind of big shows that these big brand advertisers want. But anyone else who wants to jump in that game, it's a struggle. They have to-- I mean, the list of networks out there, they just have to. Their money has to come from someone else, so it's a fight.So I think only Netflix can really win that fight. Disney obviously, also in that realm. But anyone else is going to struggle to gain the kind of traction that those guys can coming into ad-supported streaming model.Story continues- Again, looking at it from the advertisers perspective, Mark, what do they want? Is it just a matter of size? Do they want the most eyeballs? Is it a matter of the best data? Whatever the best data means right now. What do they want?MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah, so in the television realm, you have to think of it as two markets. So one market, the buyers want ads, and they want those ads on the best shows. They're just trying to build affinity for their brand, continue to expand the reach of their brand. And so that's what they're looking for, and that's why you have things like upfronts and you spend $1 million filming a commercial, a lot of things that don't makes sense. You don't need an upfront for the advertiser on Instagram, you don't need to spend $1 million on an ad.So those advertisers, they're looking for something that's unique, and they want it on the top networks on the top shows. The rest of the market, which is actually three times the size, just wants eyeballs. They want people to come to their brand, and that's why Google AdWords is so big, that's why Meta is big, and that's what Mountain does in terms of performance advertising on TV.So again, someone like Netflix, they're initially appealing to those big brand advertisers. To keep growing that over time, they're going to have to start to also compete with Google and Meta, because that's where that market, which is performance, advertising, direct response is three times larger. But it all starts with upfronts. It's just so kind of attractive to them that they can-- in one week a year, they can pull down $1 billion of revenue and then upfront, it's really hard for them to walk away from that. And that's where they all start when they enter the brand ad with the big TV markets.- Makes sense, Mark. Good to see you, Mark. Mountain CEO, Mark Douglas, appreciate it.]"

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for Phillips 66 Phillips 66's Improving ProfitsStrong earnings per share (EPS) results are an indicator of a company achieving solid profits, which investors look upon favourably and so the share price tends to reflect great EPS performance. So for many budding investors, improving EPS is considered a good sign. It's an outstanding feat for Phillips 66 to have grown EPS from US$5.75 to US$27.01 in just one year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. But the key is discerning whether something profound has changed, or if this is a just a one-off boost.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of Phillips 66 shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 1.3% to 6.8% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Phillips 66's forecast profits?Are Phillips 66 Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?It's said that there's no smoke without fire. For investors, insider buying is often the smoke that indicates which stocks could set the market alight. This view is based on the possibility that stock purchases signal bullishness on behalf of the buyer. However, small purchases are not always indicative of conviction, and insiders don't always get it right.One gleaming positive for Phillips 66, in the last year, is that a certain insider has buying shares with ample enthusiasm. Specifically, the company insider, Gregory Hayes, accumulated US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$97.75. It doesn't get much better than that, in terms of large investments from insiders.The good news, alongside the insider buying, for Phillips 66 bulls is that insiders (collectively) have a meaningful investment in the stock. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$100m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add Phillips 66 To Your Watchlist?Phillips 66's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. To sweeten the deal, insiders have significant skin in the game with one even acquiring more. This quick rundown suggests that the business may be of good quality, and also at an inflection point, so maybe Phillips 66 deserves timely attention.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.8bUS$10.1bUS$12.3bUS$13.0bUS$13.6bUS$14.1bUS$14.6bUS$15.0bUS$15.4bUS$15.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 4.46%Est @ 3.76%Est @ 3.26%Est @ 2.92%Est @ 2.68%Est @ 2.51% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$10.0kUS$8.7kUS$9.8kUS$9.6kUS$9.3kUS$8.9kUS$8.5kUS$8.1kUS$7.8kUS$7.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$88bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$16b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.1%) = US$277bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$277b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$129bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$217b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$225, the company appears quite undervalued at a 45% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amgen as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.979. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for AmgenStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Biotechs market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

115,107fecd0-1093-3ea3-8212-3baf19c6d702,AMGN,2023-07-12,3 Biotech Stocks That AI Predicts Will Deliver Triple-Digit Returns in 2025,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-biotech-stocks-ai-predicts-002453696.html,1688603093,STORY,"['AMGN', 'VRTX', 'CRSP']","[Investing in the biotech sector is mostly about risk and reward. When a company achieves FDA approval on a drug or therapeutic, it frequently has a source of revenue and profit that can last for years. And investors who buy and hold these stocks are typically rewarded with handsome total returns. Even penny stocks can become triple-digit return biotech stocks.  However, that payoff can take a long time. Just getting a drug through the clinical trial stage can take several years. And some candidates never make it to market at all. That’s the risk.  So I was curious to see what stocks an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot might recommend when prompted. My prompt was:  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips“Hi Bing, I’m looking for Biotech Stocks That Will Deliver Triple-Digit Returns in 2025. Can you help me with some ideas?” What stood out to me was that the Ai chatbot, in this case Microsoft’s Bing, played it safe. The names it suggested were mostly large-cap stocks that have a proven track record of success.  That’s a good reminder to investors. While speculating on penny stocks in the biotech sector can lead to a big payoff, it can also derail your portfolio, particularly if you’re not familiar with the science behind the drug candidate.  On the other hand, investing in some of the proven large-cap biotech companies may not be as exciting in the short term, but over time, these can still deliver the outsized gains that investors crave.  CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) CRISPR (CSPR) logo within a DNA sequenceSource: Catalin Rusnac/ShutterStock.comGene editing is likely to be one of the most important stories of the coming decade. The idea that diseases could be cured by editing the human genome is the stuff that triple-digit return biotech stocks are made of. And that’s the science behind CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP). In fairness, the real payoff may be years away, but CRISPR is the unquestioned leader in this sector. The company has a proprietary CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing platform. Story continuesCRISPR has its own pipeline that includes treatments for cancer, diabetes, and blood disorders. It also has numerous partnerships with other leading biotech companies. These partnerships should give investors the assurance that the company will have enough cash to get one of more of its pipeline candidates to market. That’s when the real growth will happen.  And while there are no guarantees in this sector, now may be a good time to invest in CRSP stock. While the stock is down approximately 20% in the last year, it’s up 38% in 2023. The stock is covered by 27 analysts and has a consensus price target of $83.78 which would be a 48% gain from the stock’s price as of this writing.  Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) logo visible on display screenSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comVertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) is next on this list of potential triple-digit return biotech stocks. And one of the bullish reasons for that is the company’s partnership with the previously mentioned CRISPR Therapeutics.  Specifically, Vertex has a licensing deal with CRISPR to advance the latter’s Exa-Cel platform for transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia and severe sickle cell disease. The companies could have approval of Exa-Cel as soon as 2024 with sales forecast to be over $1 billion in 2028.  However, prospective investors should take note that Vertex is a powerhouse biotech company in its own right. The company is the industry leader in cystic fibrosis (CF) treatments. In April, Vertex received an expanded use authorization (EUA) for its flagship CF drug, Trikafta. This expands the label for the drug to children ages 2 through 5 who meet certain conditions. And beyond all of that, Vertex has its own pipeline that gives the company several opportunities to develop additional revenue streams.  Amgen (AMGN) the Amgen (AMGN) logo on a building during daylightSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comI was a little surprised to see Bing toss in Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) as one of the triple-digit return biotech stocks for 2025. However, the company will still be generating revenue from Enbrel, its flagship oncology drug.  And earlier this year, the company made its already robust pipeline even more expansive by acquiring Horizon Therapeutics (NASDAQ:HZNP). This will give Amgen access to Horizon’s own portfolio of drugs, which includes its own oncology platform.  Unlike the other stocks on this list, Amgen is underperforming the sector. AMGN stock is down 14% in 2023 and 8.8% in the last 12 months. Still, the company is expected to grow earnings in 2023. And even with the acquisition of Horizon, the company will continue to generate significant amounts of cash.  Plus, Amgen is the only company on this list that pays a dividend. Currently, that dividend has a 3.79% yield with an annualized payout of $8.52 per share.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip our analysis of the mining industry and want to jump to the top five stocks in this list, head on over to 5 Best Mining Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying. The mining industry is responsible for powering up and providing raw materials to a variety of different industries. Whether it's bauxite for making aluminum, coal for power generation, metals for jewelry, or rare Earth metals for electronics production, mining products contribute significantly to a variety of crucial industries.Not to mention, one particular metal, gold, is quite important in the financial world as well. Gold's relationship with the U.S. dollar is a well known phenomenon, with changes to the dollar's value also creating changes in gold prices. Gold prices are generally inversely correlated to the dollar, as the precious metal is seen as the ultimate safe haven asset. Therefore, gold is also often seen as a barometer of investor sentiment against the dollar - and one that's been quite important, particularly over the past twelve months or so. The dollar has been quite strong as of late thanks to the Federal Reserve's ten interest rate hikes that have attracted deposits in U.S. banks and lent strength to the greenback due to higher demand. However, within the period of these rate hikes, as sentiment sometimes sputtered towards a weaker currency, gold prices have also soared correspondingly.Apart from being important for investors, gold is also becoming quite popular among central banks. The high interest rate environment and its effect on the yields for U.S. Treasury Bonds have stimulated interest among central banks to diversify away from these bonds as their reserves and turn to gold. Multiple data points favor this point of view. For instance, data from the World Gold Council shows that seven out of ten central banks believe that gold reserves will increase over the next twelve months, with 24% expecting to increase their reserves until May 2024.Story continuesShifting our focus from macroeconomics to the mining industry, some of the biggest mining companies in the world are BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), and Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR). Their operations range from mining for fertilizers to metals and the firms rake in billions of dollars of revenue each year. Given the mining giant that it is, BHP has several interesting initiatives that it is focusing on these days. One of these is its collaboration with the technology behemoth Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). BHP and Microsoft have teamed up to use artificial intelligence to improve productivity and extraction efficiency at the world's largest copper mine in Chile. The firm is also looking into innovative accounting methods to include the value of the environment in mine valuation estimates so that it can quantify and inform the public and investors about potential damage to the environment from their operations.Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), an agricultural inputs company that is one of the biggest potash mining companies in the world, expects that America will increase its major crop plantation area by eight million acres this year. At the same time, higher demand coupled with the supply chain constraints that have become an everyday occurrence these days will also ensure that the fertilizer market in the U.S. remains tight. Global potash demand is also expected to stray strong this year, and where supplies from Russia lack, those from Belarus are estimated to pick up the pace.Finally, another mining giant, Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) is looking to grow its copper supply in America. The firm is expanding its mining activities in Utah to invest close to half a billion dollars to deliver 250 thousand tonnes of copper over the next decade. Through these investments, Rio Tinto aims to capture the growing demand for copper from the electric vehicle market which uses the material to make batteries.Concluding our industry introduction by taking a look at what's going on in coal mining is worthwhile since the mineral has grown in popularity recently since the energy market's shakeup due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Here's what the management of the coal mining firm CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE:CEIX) had to say during the firm's first quarter of 2023 earnings call:Overall sales into the export market accounted for 66% of our total PAMC realized coal revenue, including 33% coming from the export industrial market and 13% from the export crossover metallurgical coal market. This is a crucial development for us as it demonstrates our ability to be nimble in utilizing our export marketing and logistic advantages to offset weakness in the domestic energy markets, a unique capability that few domestic coal and E&amp;P companies possess. Furthermore, our sales team opportunistically increased our forward sell position by 13.5 million tons in the first quarter for delivery through 2026, in essence increasing our sales backlog despite a challenging market backdrop. More importantly, the majority of these tons are part of the long-term contracts in the Indian industrial market through 2026, which is exciting, because we expect this market to expand substantially in the coming decade.As we work to increase the capacity of the CONSOL Marine Terminal, we’ll be even better positioned to serve this growing market. As a result of our marketing efforts in 1Q ‘23, we are now near fully contracted for 2023 and have 14.7 million tons contracted for 2024. Now let me provide an update on our balance sheet management and capital allocation progress before discussing our financial results and sustainability initiatives. We continue to make considerable progress on our stated financial priority in the quarter. First, we generated $221 million of free cash flow, approximately 45% of which was deployed toward continuing to reduce our gross debt level. When factoring in our unrestricted cash and short-term investments, our total net debt on March 31 stood at $14 million.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the top mining stocks among hedge funds, with some notable names being Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK), Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM).12 Best Mining Stocks Hedge Funds Are BuyingPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology To compile our list of the best mining stocks to buy, we first made a list of the forty largest mining companies in the world based on their market capitalization.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Paranaense de Energia has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while PSEG has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that ELP's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.ELP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.42, while PEG has a forward P/E of 18.07. We also note that ELP has a PEG ratio of 4.02. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. PEG currently has a PEG ratio of 4.17.Another notable valuation metric for ELP is its P/B ratio of 1.06. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PEG has a P/B of 2.11.Based on these metrics and many more, ELP holds a Value grade of A, while PEG has a Value grade of C.Story continuesELP has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than PEG, so it seems like value investors will conclude that ELP is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We are dedicated to providing our members with state-of-the-art facilities and becoming energy efficient is a big part of that,"" said Jay Nusblatt, President of Cobblestone Creek Country Club. ""Once we saw the incentives from PSE&amp;G and our energy savings, it became a no-brainer to move forward with an upgrade.""Donnelly Energy and Cobblestone Creek worked together to create the best and most cost-efficient plan of action for the club, which included retrofitting their existing lighting with brand new DLC-certified ENERGY STAR LEDs, replacing eight of their HVAC rooftop units with high-efficiency equipment, and upgrading two of their boiler systems.The full energy efficiency upgrade would save the club 69,798 kWH annually in electricity usage and 7,835 therms in gas usage, reducing a combined 91 metric tons of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions from the atmosphere. Enough to power 11 homes!Because Donnelly Energy is a participating contractor with PSE&amp;G's Direct Install, Cobblestone Creek received over $460,000 in upfront incentives to help cover project costs, with the rest being financed at 0% APR over the next 5 years. This resulted in no out-of-pocket expenses for the club and more importantly, no additional costs to its members.Story continuesThe first phase of work focused on upgrading the lighting within the clubhouse, including kitchen areas, offices, locker rooms, and more. All of the club's rooftop units were also replaced as well, with the rest of the project expected to be completed in Fall 2023.""As New Jersey and PSE&amp;G continue to progress towards a Clean Energy future, we have been fortunate enough to be a part of the journey,"" said Justin Avallone, Vice President of Programs for Donnelly Energy.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Aptiv APTV, Newmont NEM and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Monday.com is a no-code productivity software that provides a platform for team collaboration and project management. It offers customizable features and tools to streamline workflows, improve productivity, and facilitate effective communication within organizations.MNDY is a rapidly growing, high margin technology stock that has the potential to offer exceptionally strong returns. In addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) boosting near term expectations, monday.com stock also boasts a compelling technical trade setup.Upward Trending Earnings EstimatesEarnings estimates for monday.com have been revised dramatically higher over the last two months and now project positive earnings for the first time in the business' history.Current quarter expectations have been upgraded from -$0.22 per share to $0.14 per share and are forecast to climb 142% YoY. FY23 earnings estimates have been boosted from -$0.39 per share all the way to $0.58 per share and are expected to grow 180% YoY.With management now focusing on running a net profitable enterprise investors can sit comfortably as the 88% gross margins begin to produce considerable earnings.Sales at MNDY are forecast to grow very fast as well, with current quarter sales expected to increase 37% YoY, and FY23 sales set to climb 36% YoY.Technical SetupMNDY has been forming one of the cleanest stage one breakout patterns I have seen in some time. After getting hammered lower during the bear market of 2022, monday.com built out a 14-month base from which it may launch higher from.With a very tight consolidation forming over the last few weeks, investors have a compelling risk-reward setup to trade off. If the price of MNDY stock can trade above the $168 level on above average volume, it could send the stock much higher. Alternatively, if the price trades below $158, the setup is invalid, and investors may want to wait for another opportunity.Story continuesValuationMNDY is currently trading at a one-year forward sales multiple of 10.2x, which is above the market average of 4x, and just above its two-year median of 9.8x. This is a premium valuation based on any measurement, but when you have the growth and business economics of monday.com investors are forced to pay up.Additionally, at the current level, it is well below its 2021 highs of 48x sales, which demonstrates just how frothy the market was at that time.Bottom LineMonday.com is a hyper-growth business with a set of convincing variables writing a bullish narrative. Whether you are a trader looking for a quick profit opportunity or, an investor planning to hold for the long-term, monday.com fits the bill across the investment spectrum.Bear of the Day:Macy's has been struggling to find its footing for years following the explosion of e-commerce options, and it doesn't look like it will be improving any time soon.The top and bottom lines of the struggling retailer have experienced YoY declines in the trailing twelve months, and both are nearly flat over the last decade.While Macy's is currently trading near its cheapest valuation in more than 10 years, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), reflecting falling earnings estimates, and an unclear path forward make it a stock investors should avoid.Plummeting Earnings EstimatesWhile M battles to remain relevant in a rapidly shifting retail environment, it also faces macro headwinds adding to an even more grim setup. Waning consumer confidence and a pull back in household spending have led analysts to further downgrade sales and earnings expectations.Current quarter earnings estimates have been cut by a brutal -84% over the last two months and are expected to fall -88% YoY. FY23 earnings expectations have been downgraded by -21.6% and are forecast to decline -35% YoY.Current quarter sales are projected to fall -9.3% YoY and FY23 sales are set to decline 6% YoY.ValuationMacy's is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 5.4x, which is below the industry average of 7.6x, and below its 10-year median of 8.5x. While this does present a considerable historical discount, the business faces a tremendous uphill battle to growing sales and earnings.Bottom LineWhile Macy's seems unable to end its slow demise, it isn't from lack of trying. Its recent three-year makeover, called the Polaris strategy has created a number of innovations to better adapt to the changing retail landscape.Backstage locations, Vendor Direct, Store Pickup and Loyalty Program as well as a focus on products where the business has a foothold like jewelry and fragrances are all attempts to gain momentum. However, trying isn't enough and the retail sector continues to play catchup with the e-commerce industry.Additional content:3 Large-Cap Stocks Seeing Recent UpgradesLarge-cap stocks are a staple in almost every portfolio. They are well-established, have more analyst coverage, and frequently pay dividends, all undeniably significant benefits that make them so popular among investors.And recently, three large-cap stocks – Aptiv, Newmont and Advanced Micro Devices – have all seen favorable upgrades from analysts.Let's take a closer look at each.AptivAptiv is a designer and manufacturer of vehicle components and provides electrical, electronic, and safety technology solutions to the global automotive market. BofA Securities upgraded APTV shares to buy from neutral, with a $140 per share price target.The company's quarterly results have consistently come in above expectations as of late, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations in three consecutive quarters. Just in its latest release, APTV delivered a modest EPS surprise and reported revenue nearly 7% ahead of expectations.Keep an eye out for the company's upcoming release expected in early August; the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate of $1.00 indicates a 350% improvement in earnings from the year-ago period. Analysts have been bullish, with the quarterly estimate being revised 5% higher since April.In addition, Aptiv is projected to witness significant growth, with earnings forecasted to climb 27% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 37% in FY24. Top line growth is also apparent, with sales forecasted to climb 10% and 12% in FY23 and FY24, respectively.NewmontBarclays upgraded NEM shares to overweight from equal-weight, with a $61 per share price target. The company has enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions across the board, helping land the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares could entice value-conscious investors, further reflected by the Style Score of ""B"" for Value. Shares presently trade at an 18.2X forward earnings multiple, well beneath the 23.1X five-year median and highs of 26.7X in 2022.And for those with an appetite for income, NEM shares provide precisely that; shares currently yield a solid 3.8% annually, with the company's payout growing by an impressive 40% over the last five years.Advanced Micro DevicesNorthfield Capital Markets upgraded AMD shares to outperform from market perform, with a price target of $150 per share. The stock has been a big-time outperformer year-to-date amid the tech rally, with shares up more than 70%.Shares are trading near their 50-day moving average, a level that's been primarily respected in past instances.It's worth noting that value-focused investors may not find AMD shares enticing, with the current 40.0X forward earnings multiple residing on the higher end of the spectrum. Still, market participants have had little issue forking up the premium given the company's established nature in a critical industry.Bottom LineLarge-cap stocks are found in nearly every portfolio, as they provide a solid level of defense and carry an established nature.And recently, all three above have seen favorable upgrades among analysts.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

124,9c5449a0-d6ac-30b6-9174-f3856cb96f4b,GD,2023-07-12,Be Wary Of General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) And Its Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wary-general-dynamics-nyse-gd-120056284.html,1689163256,STORY,['GD'],"[Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. In light of that, when we looked at General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for General Dynamics:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$4.4b ÷ (US$52b - US$15b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).So, General Dynamics has an ROCE of 12%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 9.9% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics roceIn the above chart we have measured General Dynamics' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at General Dynamics doesn't inspire confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 12% from 19% five years ago. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesOn a side note, General Dynamics has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 30% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.What We Can Learn From General Dynamics' ROCETo conclude, we've found that General Dynamics is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 28% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere.Like most companies, General Dynamics does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.67%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.93%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 9.29%.Heading into today, shares of the defense contractor had gained 0.76% over the past month, outpacing the Aerospace sector's gain of 0.55% and lagging the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.65% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from General Dynamics as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be July 26, 2023. In that report, analysts expect General Dynamics to post earnings of $2.59 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 5.82%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $9.41 billion, up 2.45% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $12.65 per share and revenue of $41.38 billion, which would represent changes of +3.77% and +5.01%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for General Dynamics. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.1% lower. General Dynamics is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesLooking at its valuation, General Dynamics is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 16.97. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 16.42, so we one might conclude that General Dynamics is trading at a premium comparatively.It is also worth noting that GD currently has a PEG ratio of 1.9. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. GD's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.87 as of yesterday's close.The Aerospace - Defense industry is part of the Aerospace sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 163, putting it in the bottom 36% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.To follow GD in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:ZTS),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-zoetis-inc-120052673.html,1689163252,STORY,['ZTS'],"[Key InsightsZoetis' estimated fair value is US$158 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$170 suggests Zoetis is potentially trading close to its fair value The US$212 analyst price target for ZTS is 34% more than our estimate of fair valueToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis Is Zoetis Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.44bUS$2.62bUS$3.03bUS$3.36bUS$3.61bUS$3.82bUS$3.99bUS$4.15bUS$4.29bUS$4.42bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x4Est @ 7.32%Est @ 5.76%Est @ 4.66%Est @ 3.90%Est @ 3.36%Est @ 2.99% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.5kUS$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$24bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$95bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$95b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$49bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$73b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$170, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Zoetis as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for ZoetisStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Pharmaceuticals market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Jazz Pharmaceuticals and Zoetis are both sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.JAZZ currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.10, while ZTS has a forward P/E of 31.49. We also note that JAZZ has a PEG ratio of 0.59. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. ZTS currently has a PEG ratio of 2.75.Another notable valuation metric for JAZZ is its P/B ratio of 2.38. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ZTS has a P/B of 17.51.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help JAZZ earn a Value grade of A, while ZTS has been given a Value grade of C.Both JAZZ and ZTS are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that JAZZ is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Honeywell International Inc. HON, Humana Inc.'s HUM, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. KDP, NextEra Energy Inc. NEE and The Coca-Cola Co. KO.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Buy 5 Underperformers of 1H23 That Are Set to RollWall Street had an impressive first half 2023 after a disappointing 2022. Major stock indexes achieved several milestones during this period. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite exited the bear market and formed a new bull market in first-half 2023. The S&amp;P 500 recorded its best half in four years while the Nasdaq Composite posted its best first-half in 40 years.Consequently, most of the stocks surged during this period. This was a reversal from 2022, when most of the U.S. stocks plummeted as the pandemic-era fiscal incentives were withdrawn and the Fed pursued tight monetary control with rigorous increases in the benchmark interest rate.As a result, Wall Street started 2023 with an overall undervaluation of equity markets. The steady decline in the inflation rate from its peak in June 2022 and the Fed's reduction of the magnitude of interest rate hike also favored U.S. stock markets.However, several stocks did not participate in the dream rally of first-half 2023. Many of these stocks are set to roll in the second half. At this stage, it should be prudent to invest in such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate bigwigs (market capital &gt;$40 billion) with negative returns in stock prices in the first half of 2023. These stocks have strong potential for the rest of 2023. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesHoneywell International Inc. is benefiting from recovery in commercial flight hours and strength in advanced materials and UOP businesses. Solid operational execution, pricing actions and cost-control measures continue to drive HON's top line. The company's bullish forecast for 2023 holds promise. HON's deal to acquire Compressor Controls will be beneficial going forward.Honeywell International has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 3.2% and 3.6%, respectively, for the current quarter (ending September 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days.Humana Inc.'s Medicaid business benefits from several contract wins and renewals, thereby contributing to its top line. Strategic buyouts and alliances place HUM well for growth in the future. HUM's revenues for 2023 are expected within $104.4-$106.4 billion.Solid contributions from the Insurance and CenterWell segments bode well for HUM. We expect Medicaid revenues to be $7.6 billion in 2023. Management estimates 2023 EPS to be at least $28.25, reflecting at least 11.9% growth year over year.Humana has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 11.8%, respectively, for the current quarter (ending September 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has improved 0.4% over the last seven days.Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. posted first-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both metrics improved year over year. Results have gained from continued brand strength and significant pricing.KDP has been witnessing continued momentum in the Refreshment Beverages segment for a long time. KDP witnessed market share expansion above 88% of its cold beverage portfolio. This mainly reflected strength in CSDs, seltzers, energy, apple juice, coconut waters and fruit drinks.Keurig Dr Pepper has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.6% and 10.9%, respectively, for the current quarter (ending September 2023).

NextEra has ample liquidity to meet its near-term debt obligations and efficient debt management acts as a tailwind. NEE is expanding its operations in the water space through acquisition.NextEra Energy has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.4% and 5.9%, respectively, for the current quarter (ending September 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has improved 5% over the last 60 days.The Coca-Cola Co. has benefited from the continued momentum in its business. Sales have gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and a rise in concentrate sales. KO is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. KO provided an upbeat guidance for 2023.The Coca-Cola has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.7% and 1.5%, respectively, for the current quarter (ending September 2023).

131,693c9dc7-f045-39cf-a12b-351eee141b4f,BK,2023-07-12,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-corporation-bk-140020321.html,1689084020,STORY,['BK'],"[The market expects The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.22 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.1%.Revenues are expected to be $4.38 billion, up 2.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.87% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation?For The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.70%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation would post earnings of $1.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.13, delivering a surprise of +3.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM), another stock in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $3.66 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +32.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $37.24 billion, up 21.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has been revised 0.1% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -2.25%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.93%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 9.29%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the processor of debit and credit card payments had gained 4.49% over the past month. This has outpaced the Business Services sector's gain of 2.2% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.65% in that time.MasterCard will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be July 27, 2023.

This is due to their current downtrodden state following the regional banking crisis from earlier this year.But tread carefully.Financial stocks are lagging in 2023, with the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) flat on a year-to-date basis vs a more than 15% gain for the S&amp;P 500. When just looking at regional banks, the underperformance is even worse, with the SPDR S&amp;P Regional BAnking ETF (KRE) down 28% so far this year.Bank stocks can be ""value traps,"" according to a recent research note from BofA Global Research.However, there are winners even in this bleak scenario: High-quality financial services stocks with strong balance sheets that are undervalued.How to find the best financial stocks to buyOne way to screen for these top financial stocks is the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index, which tracks the lowest-priced companies with competitive advantages that are expected to last more than 20 years into the future.This index has outperformed U.S. stocks over time: Since its debut in 2007, the index has more than quadrupled compared with a threefold increase in the S&amp;P 500.Morningstar calls these wide-moat stocks ""very rare,"" as they are the ""cream of the crop in terms of the quality and durability of their business models.""We used this index as a jumping off point to find the best stocks to buy in the financial sector, while expanding our scope to find a handful of hiqh-quality blue chip stocks that have impressive fundamental strength.We also only included stocks that boast consensus recommendations of Buy or better at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. The research firm scores analysts' ratings on a five-point scale, with 1.0 being the best (Strong Buy) and 5.0 being the worst (Strong Sell). To make this list, stocks needed a score of 2.5 (Buy) or lower.Story continuesWith that in mind, here are the best financial stocks to buy.Stocks Warren Buffett is Buying and SellingData is as of July 10. Analysts' recommendations and other data courtesy of S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence and Morningstar, unless otherwise noted. Stocks are listed by analysts' consensus recommendation, from lowest to highest.Market value: $28.1 billionDividend yield: 0.7%Analysts' consensus recommendation: 2.18 (Buy)Equifax (EFX, $229.13) is one of the three big U.S. credit bureaus, along with TransUnion and Experian. But its business spans beyond determining a good credit score.The company has beefed up its core business with a string of complementary acquisitions, notably Kount, an AI-powered fraud prevention and digital identity solutions company it bought for $640 million in 2021. A year later, it added Midigator, a provider of post-transaction fraud mitigation solutions, to its stable of offerings.EFX is one of the best financial stocks in terms of price performance, with a quarterly total return (price + dividends) over 15 years that has outpaced the industry: 14.0% annually compared to 10.7%. It also outperformed the broadly diversified Morningstar U.S. Market TR Index, which returned 10.8% a year over the same period.Notably, ""Equifax's star in recent years has been its workforce solutions segment, which is now its largest segment,"" Morningstar analyst Rajiv Bhatia said in a research note.Workforce solutions encompass human resources compliance management such as employee onboarding, payroll, tax management, compliance and the like.The $1.8 billion acquisition of Appriss Insights in 2021 expanded the capabilities of workforce solutions, he said. Appriss provides risk and criminal justice intelligence products and solutions. This information is used for public and workplace safety, law enforcement purposes, corporate investigations, fraud detection and prevention and healthcare sanctioning and credentialing.Workforce solutions also include income verification, mainly for mortgages, which the analyst said Equifax does not have ""meaningful direct competition."" He expects EFX to stay in the lead ""as the large amount of existing records and the difficulty of convincing employers to share employee information would be too tough for new entrants to overcome.""The analyst expects Equifax to expand its income verification services to auto, card, government services, and employment screening.Why Luxury Stocks are Worth Investing InMarket value: $104.3 billionDividend yield: 2.9%Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.82 (Buy)BlackRock (BLK, $696.17) is the world's largest asset manager with $9 trillion in assets under management (AUM) as of the first quarter of 2023. About 80% of its AUM comes from institutional clients, which tend to be more stable than individual investors, according to Morningstar.As investors flock to passive investments such as index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), BlackRock is well-positioned because passive strategies make up two-thirds of its AUM. Its iShares ETF offerings account for a third of all its managed assets and are the market share leader in the U.S. and globally.The asset management company is diversified as well: Half of its AUM consists of equity assets, 29% is in fixed income, with money market funds, multi-asset classes and alternatives comprising the rest. BlackRock has clients in more than 100 countries – 62% in the Americas, 29% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and 9% in the Asia-Pacific region.According to Morningstar, BlackRock will benefit from an expanding ETF market, improved active fund operations, further adoption of ESG analytics and investing, increased multi-asset and alternatives exposure and continued efforts to use the latest technology.BLK is looking to expand in the Asia-Pacific region as well. It already has an asset management joint venture in China with Temasek and China Construction Bank, the world's second largest bank, aimed at the Chinese market. Notably, BlackRock has gotten Chinese regulatory permission to be one of the first global asset managers to run a wholly owned mutual fund business in China.BlackRock is ""well-positioned to drive superior long-term net new assets and market share gains across asset classes, distribution channels and geographies,"" according to a recent research note from Credit Suisse. And this is why BLK will likely remain on lists of the best financial stocks for years to come.Investing Jargon, ExplainedMarket value: $63.4 billionDividend yield: 1.5%Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.82 (Buy)Intercontinental Exchange (ICE, $113.16) is the parent of the venerable New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the New York Board of Trade and the Chicago Stock Exchange, among other institutions. It operates a total of 10 exchanges and six clearing houses around the world.But the company has been diversifying its revenue sources through acquisitions of businesses in mortgage technology and fixed income and data services, as competition among exchanges remains stiff.In mortgage technology, ICE provides a platform of comprehensive tools for mortgage application up through closing and the secondary market. The fixed income and data services unit offers fixed income pricing, reference data, indices, analytics and execution services plus global credit default swap clearing and multi-asset class data delivery solutions.ICE is currently planning to acquire the loan origination business of Black Knight for $11.7 billion in a 90% cash, 10% stock deal. This acquisition will boost ICE's position as a provider of end-to-end home mortgage services. However, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is suing to block the deal on anti-competitive grounds. The case is ongoing.The current market volatility and rising interest rates have boosted exchange revenue as trading volume increased in certain products. However, they have also held down the mortgage business as demand softened.""Given the macro uncertainty and likely continued market volatility, we think investors will have greater appreciation for the defensive earnings profile of the exchanges,"" according to a recent note from Deutsche Bank.Intercontinental Exchange is a member of the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index, which has outperformed U.S. stocks over time. ICE has also been one of the best financial stocks in terms of price performance, boasting an average annual total return of 14.4% over the past 15 years vs an 11.0% return for the S&amp;P 500.5 Special Situation Stocks for Growth &amp; IncomeMarket value: $15.4 billionDividend yield: 0.5%Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.93 (Buy)Tradeweb Markets (TW, $65.71) was formed in 1996 as an online exchange serving the opaque U.S. Treasuries market. Today, it operates electronic trading platforms for fixed-income products, derivatives and ETFs.TW remains a leader in electronic trading of fixed-income securities, according to Morningstar. Since most fixed-income trading is still done by phone or chat, Tradeweb's electronic marketplace ensures it has a long runway of growth ahead of it, Morningstar analyst Michael Miller wrote.He expects Tradeweb to see low double-digit revenue growth for years to come.However, competition is bound to come as electronic networks become more attractive to traders. ""As Tradeweb rolls out new features like automated trade execution and portfolio trading, the cost advantages of electronic trading networks over traditional methods continues to increase,"" he said. But this transition is still in its early days.In the current environment of market volatility, TW as a trading platform benefits in the form of increased trading volumes, according to a research note from Deutsche Bank.In its latest quarterly earnings report, this top financial stock said average daily trading volume hit a record of $1.4 trillion, up 16% from the year prior. This impressive milestone was notched amid strength in European government bonds, repurchase agreements, retail U.S. government bonds and other securities.Tradeweb launched a new market data service to calculate iNAVs (intraday net asset value) meant to represent a single share of an ETF. BlackRock is the first client for the service. Also, the company is in talks to acquire Yieldbroker, a government bond and derivatives platform for Australia and New Zealand, for AUD 125 million ($83 million).What Is a Single-Stock ETF?Market value: $77.3 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' consensus recommendation: 1.86 (Buy)As the first-ever digital payments platform, PayPal Holdings (PYPL, $69.28) continues to be a leader in e-commerce – and one of Wall Street's best financial stocks – since its founding in 2000.Today, the company has been strengthening its position in the digital payments space through a spate of acquisitions, notably that of mobile payments platform Venmo, and Braintree, which lets businesses accept online payments, both in 2013.Other acquisitions included Xoom, an international money transfer service to 52 countries, Swedish payment processor Zettle, digital coupons company PayPal Honey, mobile payment startup Paydiant and Card.io, whose software lets cameras capture credit card information.But PayPal is facing stiff rising competition from Apple's (AAPL) Apple Pay and Block's (SQ) Cash App, according to Deutsche Bank.The investment bank's fintech survey showed that ""while PayPal continues to be the dominant mobile payment service with 71% of respondents having used the service in the past 12 months, Cash App and Apple Pay both saw large increases in adoption over the past year reaching 46% and 31% adoption, respectively, up from 31% and 23%, respectively.""However, PayPal is off to a strong start this year despite the weakening macroeconomic environment of persistent inflation and rising interest rates. Net revenue grew by 9% to $7 billion in the first quarter, while total payment volume (TPV) rose by 10% to $354.5 billion.Earnings per share (EPS) rose by 33% to $1.17 and operating cash flow was $1.2 billion, with free cash flow coming in at $1 billion.Analysts are expecting steady growth for PYPL's second-quarter results, as well. Current estimates are for EPS to be up nearly 25% year-over-year and revenue to rise 6.9%.""PayPal shares continue to provide exposure to a unique and scaled two-sided network"" with around 400 million users and 35 million merchants on its platform, according to a recent Credit Suisse note.The Pros' Investment Strategies for Today's MarketMarket value: $424.2 billionDividend yield: 2.8%Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.84 (Buy)JPMorgan Chase (JPM, $145.15) is typically found on lists of the best financial stocks to own, and for good reason. It is the largest bank in the U.S. and among the largest in the world, based on assets. It also found itself becoming arguably the most influential financial institution in America following the spring 2023 regional banking crisis.In early May, JPMorgan acquired the majority of First Republic Bank's operations at the behest of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC). The regional bank was collapsing following a bank run that was sparked by the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.""Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,"" said JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, in a statement.First Republic is the third failed bank JPMorgan has taken over, following Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual during the financial crisis of 2008. JPM stepping in has helped to defuse bank depositor panics.These takeovers helped to propel JPMorgan's assets to $3.7 billion at the end of Q1. But above it all is Dimon, who is himself an influential figure in finance.The bank's namesake, John Pierpoint Morgan Sr., famously locked his Wall Street peers in his study until they agreed to join him in bailing out a panic-stricken financial system in 1907, according to The New York Times. ""Not since then has the leader of a single company held such sway over the U.S. financial system,"" the paper said.JPMorgan's 10-year total return of 12.2% on average per year has outpaced the industry, which clocks in at 5.5%. Over a 15-year horizon, JPMorgan returned 11.5% on average per year vs 3.1% for the industry.Stock Picks That Billionaires LoveMarket value: $158.8 billionDividend yield: 2.8%Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.81 (Buy)Wells Fargo (WFC, $42.32) is one of the country's Big Four banks, along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C). It also has a broad network of retail branches. The bank is one of the largest issuers of credit and debit cards, as well, and is a leader in commercial banking and consumer financial products, according to Morningstar.The bank also is slowly emerging from its 2016 fake accounts scandal and regulatory punishments in which the Fed imposed a cap on its asset size. ""We're already starting to see glimpses of the transition to offense from defense,"" Morningstar analyst Eric Compton wrote.These include the launch of several new card products, the advisor count not declining for the first time in years and $2.2 billion of incremental internal investments in 2023. However, a full turnaround could take years.Despite headwinds, Wells Fargo has the third most deposits in the U.S. after JPMorgan and Bank of America.Compton believes Wells Fargo still has a wide competitive moat due to cost advantages and the reluctance of most depositors to switch banks. The financial firm has lower costs due to its large scale and breadth of products.Wells Fargo is large enough to be considered a global systemically important bank, too. The top financial stock is also a member of the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index, which tracks the lowest-priced companies with competitive advantages that are expected to last more than 20 years into the future.Four Random Facts and Thoughts About Warren BuffettMarket value: $130.0 billionDividend yield: 0.7%Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.72 (Buy)Intuit (INTU, $464.33) is the financial giant behind TurboTax, the do-it-yourself tax filing service and software, as well as QuickBooks, the popular bookkeeping software for small businesses and sole proprietors. It also owns popular email marketing firm, Mailchimp, and credit-scoring firm Credit Karma.The company has been expanding its total addressable market by offering to do taxes for consumers and small businesses. In this year's Super Bowl, it debuted a commercial that tells people they can ""Come to TurboTax and don't do your taxes."" Instead, taxpayers will be matched with a tax expert who will prepare and file their taxes in just one meeting.Intuit is doing the same with QuickBooks by evolving it into a portfolio of expert services available to small businesses. In the second quarter, it launched a free service in which experts guide QuickBook through its new suite of offerings.With Credit Karma, INTU is adding new services such as users getting tax refunds as quickly as one minute after the IRS accepts their tax returns. This and other new services are aimed at making Credit Karma into a ""comprehensive, self-driving financial platform,"" said Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi, on a recent earnings call.Intuit continues to expect double-digit annual revenue growth for 2023, although it is lower than prior years amid macroeconomic pressures.Still, INTU is one of the best financial stocks, as evidenced by its consensus Buy rating. Deutsche Bank is among those that has a Buy rating on Intuit, saying the company enjoys higher average revenue per return for TurboTax, driven by its premium offerings such as full service.What's more, Intuit is a member of the outperforming Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index.Best Index Funds for a Low-Priced PortfolioMarket value: $371.6 billionDividend yield: 0.6%Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.50 (Strong Buy)Mastercard (MA, $392.16) needs no introduction for anyone with a credit card. It is the second most accepted card in the world, after Visa (V). The card company benefits from a network effect in which the more consumers join the payment network, the more attractive the network becomes to merchants.Mastercard's business has stayed resilient in the face of a softening economy. In the first quarter, net revenue rose by a higher-than-expected 11% from the prior year.As a result, BMO Capital Markets raised its estimates and 12-month target price to $442 from $414. The stock is rated Outperform, or the equivalent of Buy.""Mastercard has yet to observe weakness in consumer spending,"" according to a recent BMO research note. ""We do not anticipate any near-term impact from the announced Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation.""In April, Mastercard received a ""civil investigative demand"" (CID) from the DOJ's antitrust division about its debit card program. In January, Visa got a CID from the DOJ over its debit card transactions.Credit Suisse reiterated its Outperform rating on the stock. It also raised its 2023 EPS estimate by a dime to $12.35 and 2024 by 29 cents to $14.72.""We continue to believe that Mastercard has attractive qualities in the current environment,"" including its profitability, balanced exposure, ability to grow through moderate recessionary conditions, and other advantages, the research firm wrote in a note to clients.BMO and Credit Suisse are hardly alone in thinking MA is one of the best financial stocks around. As proof, it is the only name on this list with a consensus Strong Buy rating, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.Best Retirement Stocks to Buy Now]"

For more stocks on this list, head on over to 5 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Now.The macroeconomic landscape in the United States, which has been a focal point in headlines and the stock market for over two years, is undergoing a rapid transformation. Just a year ago, investors' primary concerns revolved around interest rates and heightened inflation. However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent commodity shock, along with pandemic-induced stimulatory spending, compelled the Federal Reserve to swiftly increase interest rates. As the market enters the second half of 2023, the Federal Reserve's decisive approach to interest rate hikes is finally bringing about some clarity regarding an economic cooldown.Earlier this June, Fed officials made predictions indicating their intention to raise interest rates twice more within the year, assuming these adjustments would be made in quarter-point increments. However, that does not mean that the Fed must hurt the labor market to achieve policymakers’ goals. In fact, Fed Chair Powell has acknowledged that wages are not necessarily the primary factor driving current inflation. He has noted that wages and inflation often exhibit a correlated relationship, but determining which one is causing the other is challenging to determine.As the July 7 payrolls report approached, traders were preparing for a potentially impactful event. Surprisingly robust data released by the ADP Research Institute a day prior had convinced the market that job growth in the US was still ""too strong"" from the perspective of central bankers cautious about inflation. According to the report, US employers added 209,000 jobs in June, falling short of Wall Street expectations. This led to concerns that the Federal Reserve might implement tighter monetary policy. However, the outcome presented a more nuanced view of the labor market, indicating a moderate slowdown that aligns with the Fed's objectives, albeit at a slower pace than anticipated by some. Investors widely expect the Fed to raise interest rates at their July meeting, and the strength of the labor market could help to shape the outlook after that.Story continuesThese are all developments affecting the market in the short-term. If you are a long-term investor who is looking for forever stocks to buy as we do in our monthly newsletter, you hope that the stock market declines by at least 20% to buy your favorite stocks at a discount. At the end of September 2022, the market provided such an opportunity. We don't think we are going to get another opportunity in the near future and this may be relatively the best time to buy.As the market closed the first half of this year with a positive boost from a reassuring inflation report, the notion of acquiring the best ""forever stocks"" might appear overly cautious. With market sentiment strong and supported by seemingly justifiable factors, investors may lean towards riskier securities with higher potential returns. However, it's important to acknowledge that long-term stock investments hold their own value and significance. With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some potential forever stocks, out of which the top picks include the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), among others listed below.13 Best Forever Stocks to Buy NowOur Methodology""Our favorite holding period is forever."" When it comes to long-term investments, who better to imitate than Wall Street's legendary value investor, Warren Buffett. In order to compile our selection of the best forever stocks, we began by analyzing Buffett's stock portfolio and chose to highlight the stock holdings that have remained within his portfolio for at least 5 years. Next, we assessed the number of hedge fund investors associated with each stock based on Insider Monkey’s survey of 943 funds during the first quarter of this year. Using this information, the stocks were ranked.To be clear the following 13 stocks are the best forever stocks to buy according to billionaire investor and secret hedge fund manager Warren Buffett. We have our own list of favorite forever stocks that we share in our premium newsletter. You should do your own research and decide any of the following stocks fit your definition of forever stocks:13. DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) is a prominent healthcare company specializing in kidney care services. With a significant presence, it ranks among the largest providers of dialysis services in the United States. The company's primary focus lies in treating individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney failure.Lisa Bedell Clive at Bernstein issued an update on May 15, raising the price target on DaVita Inc. (NYSE: DVA) from $88 to $100. This adjustment came in response to the company's improved 2023 guidance, which was announced on May 9.After digging through 943 hedge funds for their March quarter of 2023 investments, Insider Monkey discovered that 32 had bought DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)’s shares. The firm’s second largest investor after Warren Buffett is Jeffrey Gates’ Gates Capital Management, owning one million shares that are worth $84 million.Here is what Moon Capital Management said about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) ranks among the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a decent stock for long-term investments.12. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), commonly known as Kraft Heinz, is an American multinational food company formed by the merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz Company co-headquartered in Chicago and Pittsburgh. The company is involved in making and selling a wide variety of products, including cheese, meals, meats, dairy products, spices, coffee, and others.The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) released its Q1 financial results on May 3, revealing a non-GAAP EPS of $0.68 and revenue of $6.49 billion. These figures exceeded Wall Street estimates by $0.08 and $100 million, respectively. Additionally, the company anticipates a 4% to 6% growth in organic net sales for 2023, as compared to the previous year.Out of the 943 hedge funds included in Insider Monkey's Q1 2023 database, 34 of them held a stake in The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC). First Eagle Investment Management, managed by Jean-Marie Eveillard, emerged as the largest hedge fund investor, with a stake worth $256 million, equivalent to 6.6 million shares. However, the largest overall investor in Kraft Heinz is Warren Buffett, with a massive investment of $12 billion.11. VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Verisign Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) is an American company based in Reston, Virginia, United States, that operates a diverse array of network infrastructure that allows firms to maintain their servers, access domain names, and run security applications. The company ended the first quarter of 2023 with 174.8 million domains in the .com/.net base, which was 1 million more than it ended in the same quarter a year ago.By the end of this year’s first quarter, 37 of the 943 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey’s database had held a stake in the company. Following Warren Buffett, Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)'s largest shareholder, which owns 3.1 million shares that are worth $672 million.10. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), or simply Kroger, is an American retail company that operates supermarkets and multi-department stores throughout the United States. With more than 2,700 supermarkets and multi-department stores spread across 35 states in the United States, The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) ranks as one of the largest food retailers in the world.Earlier this June, UBS lowered the price target on The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) to $48 from $51 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. According to the analysts', sentiment on Kroger remains mixed despite a ""strong"" performance in Q1 as its FY23 outlook remains uncertain. The firm also states that the tone will likely remain mixed until the market gains more confidence in Kroger's intermediate-term outlook and that this will likely leave the stock range-bound for ""the foreseeable future.""Insider Monkey took a look at 943 hedge funds for their first quarter of 2023 investments and found out that 43 had owned The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)’s shares. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns a $2.5 billion stake in the company.Oakmark Funds, advised by Harris Associates, made the following comment about The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption.”9. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO), commonly known as Moody's, is an American business and financial services company. It serves as the parent company for Moody's Investors Service (MIS), an American credit rating agency, and Moody's Analytics (MA), a provider of financial analysis software and services based in the United States.Jeffrey Silber, an analyst at BMO Capital, restated an Outperform rating for Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) stock on May 17, while increasing the target price from $355 to $360. Silber holds the belief that Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) has the potential for a substantial upside of over 16%, considering the closing stock price as of May 18.By the end of Q1 2023, 51 of the 943 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey had bought a stake in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO). A major hedge fund investor is Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management with a $3.17 billion stake.8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Established in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is a prominent American multinational corporation renowned for its production of the iconic Coca-Cola beverage. In addition to its flagship product, the company is involved in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse array of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even some alcoholic beverages within the beverage industry. As one of the largest beverage corporations globally, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) holds a significant position among the long-term investments of renowned value investor Warren Buffett. Buffett, who has maintained a stake in the company since 2010, has famously expressed his unwavering commitment to retain his shares in the company.On June 6, HSBC analyst Carlos Laboy lowered the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $74 from $77 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst views Coca-Cola as a much better defensive stock in inflationary times than in the past. However, his near term concern for beverage giant remains the ongoing tax litigation, which it says could cost the company up to 14 billion in payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”7. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73General Motors, formally the General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), is an American multinational automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, United States.During the initial quarter of 2023, the company experienced an impressive 11.1% growth in revenue compared to the previous year, reaching nearly $40 billion. Additionally, the automotive operating cash flow for the quarter rose to $2.3 billion, showcasing a significant increase from $1.6 billion in the same period of the previous year.Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) from an Equal Weight rating to an Overweight rating on May 1. Additionally, the analyst increased the price target on the stock from $35 to $38. Recognizing General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) as one of the leading companies in the auto sector, Jones included it in his list of the ""top 5"" automotive companies.According to Insider Monkey’s Q1 2023 database, 73 hedge funds disclosed long positions in General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), worth roughly $4 billion. Of these, investment firm Harris Associates holds a significant position as a shareholder.6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American multinational consumer goods corporation headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. The company provides branded consumer packaged goods worldwide, operating through Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segments.On April 11, the company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.9407 per share, marking a 3% increase. With this raise, the company extended its impressive streak of dividend growth to 67 years, solidifying its position as not only one of the top dividend aristocrat stocks on our list, but also one of the best forever stock.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), compared to 74 funds in the preceding quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.94 million shares valued at $735.2 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”Much like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a top 'forever' stock finding favor with hedge funds.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Now.

137,d6543984-a1b7-317b-a6f5-9d6bc83afddc,QCOM,2023-07-12,3 Growth Stocks Ready to Shine Bright This Summer,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-growth-stocks-ready-shine-142743641.html,1688567263,STORY,"['QCOM', 'AMZN', 'ALB']","[As we enter the second half of 2023, growth stocks are showing promise. July has historically been a favorable month for tech-heavy Nasdaq stocks, with consistent gains throughout the past 15 years. While these patterns may be coincidental, it’s worth considering these three top growth stocks for potential summer investments.Here are three of the top growth stocks I think are worth buying for this summer. These are stocks I either own or intend to own, if any significant dips materialize in the coming months. Let’s dive into these stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsQualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor signSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a prominent player in the mobile processor industry, poised to capitalize on the increasing demand for 5G-enabled devices. With 5G technology driving substantial growth in the mobile market, Qualcomm’s expertise in 5G chip development positions the company favorably to capture a significant market share.QCOM is currently facing a downturn along with other semiconductor stocks, but it is likely near the bottom. Sales are expected to decline this year but recover in the next two years, presenting potential upside. Despite moderate growth projections, there could be positive surprises if the handset market improves.Qualcomm boasts strong financials with a three-year revenue growth rate of 25% and a book growth rate of 55.3%. Surprisingly, the market undervalues QCOM with a low forward multiple of 12.21, placing it ahead of 86.26% of its competitors in terms of discounted earnings.Amazon (AMZN)amazon (AMZN) sign with dark backgroundSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a significant advantage in leveraging AI due to its vast customer data, positioning the company as a strong contender in the tech sector. The potential benefits of AI for Amazon include enhancing search capabilities, anticipating future purchases, and strengthening its AI offerings within Amazon Web Services (AWS).Story continuesAmazon’s  stock has surged by more than 51% this year, driven by excitement surrounding artificial intelligence advancements. However, the company faces challenges, including slower AI progress compared to competitors like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and concerns about its high valuation. Despite these factors, Amazon’s e-commerce and AWS businesses continue to generate revenue and income growth. AWS is expected to benefit from the shift toward digitization and AI. Nevertheless, Amazon also faces regulatory scrutiny, with the Federal Trade Commission reportedly preparing for a potential antitrust lawsuit.Investing in Amazon and other long-term tech stocks offers smart investors sustainable returns with favorable growth prospects and attractive valuations.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is the leading choice for lithium stocks, given its undervalued status and promising growth potential. As global lithium supplies fall short of electric vehicle demand, Albemarle stands to benefit. With anticipated revenue growth of 35% to 55% in 2023 and a projected 20% to 30% annual increase in lithium sales volume through 2027, the company ensures robust growth and improved price realization.Albemarle is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for lithium driven by the rise of electric vehicles. With expanded capacity and ambitious growth targets, the company is primed for revenue and EBITDA growth. Despite price fluctuations, Albemarle maintains a consistent performance and a strong dividend history spanning 28 years.Regardless of a recent correction in lithium prices, the increasing demand for electric vehicles suggests a continued upward trend for lithium. Limited supplies are unlikely to meet the growing EV demand, reinforcing the positive outlook for the lithium market.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in AMZN.

If you want to skip our analysis of the stock market and want to jump to the top five stocks in our list, then take a look at 5 Best Breakout Stocks to Buy Now. The mini week of trading after the July Fourth holiday came with a series of surprises for investors. These were in the form of multiple data releases, all of which covered the state of the labor market. This market is one of the hottest (literally and figuratively) markets right now, since not only is it not refusing to slow down (much to the delight of politicians) but also because the Federal Reserve is watching it like a hawk. Growth in the labor market, especially when it is tight, results in an increase in wages that eventually contribute to inflation. Given that inflation is one of the biggest problems facing the American economy right now, the Federal Reserve is publicly committed to bringing it down through interest rate hikes.The slew of data releases in the first week of July revealed that the private sector added more than twice the number of jobs that economists had predicted. At the same time, unemployment claims for the final week of June also ticked up and the unemployment rate did not fall. Additionally, both the number of job openings and the opening rate declined in May as well, indicating on a whole that perhaps the economy is finally ready to slow down after taking a brutal beating in the form of ten interest rate hikes.Despite high rates and the constant worries of a recession, the stock market has performed remarkably well this year. The star of the show is the NASDAQ 100 index - up by 39.4% during the first half of this year to mark its strongest performance in decades. The index's fortune was boosted by big technology firms and mega cap stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) which have profited from the mania surrounding artificial intelligence. If you're interested in some hot NASDAQ stocks, be sure to check out 15 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Today.Story continuesHowever, the past is past and it's time to look at the future. After all, even as investors took a well earned break after H1, the reality still remains that inflation is high and more potential interest rate hikes might be looming on the horizon. And the latest employment data that we've talked about above is already making its mark on the market. After trading closed on the day the private payrolls data was released, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by a percent and two year Treasury yields jumped to 5.12% - at levels that it had stood in 2007. Investors' fear about more interest rate hikes was mirrored in the Cboe Volatility Index which closed the day to mark an 8.9% jump - which seems paltry considering the fact that it had jumped by a stunning 14.7%, mirroring growth levels that it had reached when bank shares fell earlier this year after the dramatic failure of several high profile banks.All eyes therefore shifted on the payrolls report for June that was due Friday. The private payrolls report set the scene for the upcoming release that will set the tone for the Federal Reserve's next meeting later this month. The central bank will decide whether to increase or keep rates the same, and optimistic investors have been penciling in just one rate hike for July. Officials at the central bank have currently decided to act cautiously, as ten interest rate hikes take their time to work through the economy. However, fears persisted that an unrelenting jobs market might force them to return to the brutal hawkishness displayed in 2023 when stunning 75 basis point hikes were delivered at a time when inflation had crossed 9%.So were investors expecting from the payrolls report that investors are waiting for with bated breaths? Well, Dow Jones consensus estimates believed that the number of jobs will grow by 240,000. The Labor Department's data for May showed that the economy had added 339,000 jobs (revised later to 309,000), and had the estimate held, then the labor market will have slowed down only annually. The May report had seen jobs drop by 51,000, and a reading of 240,000 for June would have implied an annual drop greater than a hundred thousand. Safe to say, the economic situation right now is quite different from a year back, but the key investor irritant is a resistant market that just invites the Federal Reserve to pump up the rates.The data itself was a pleasant surprise that turned around the narrative of the labor market refusing to budge on its head. It revealed that the U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs which ended up significantly undershooting market estimates and falling quite low over the data for May. As a result, major stock indexes including the NASDAQ 100, NASDAQ Composite, the S&amp;P500, and the NYSE Composite all jumped - with the U.S. dollar also tumbling in the currency market.So what to do in a world where markets go one way one day and another the next? Well, perhaps a recent analysis from Morgan Stanley might help, where the investment bank takes a rather gloomy tone:In the current market, we see a few opportunities. In fixed income, consider adding duration by investing in longer-maturity bonds. In equities, we believe that U.S. stock returns are apt to be below average. Investors should diversify using active managers or equal-weighted indices. We continue to see Japanese and emerging-markets stocks, as well as commodities, as good hedges for a peaking U.S. dollar.The bottom line: Investors need to think about the big picture. Don’t try to predict market moves. Instead, work with your Financial Advisor to stay close to your strategic asset allocations, rebalancing as needed.With this backdrop, let's take a look at some stocks that are performing well as part of coverage of the top breakout stocks to buy. Some notable names are Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

139,cf40da8d-ea89-3629-824a-6e19457d0702,LMT,2023-07-12,Lockheed Martin (LMT) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-lmt-earnings-expected-140019529.html,1689084019,STORY,['LMT'],"[Lockheed Martin (LMT) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 18. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis aerospace and defense company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +223.1%.Revenues are expected to be $15.86 billion, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.05% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lockheed?For Lockheed, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.84%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Lockheed will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Lockheed would post earnings of $6.07 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.43, delivering a surprise of +5.93%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Lockheed doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The deal has been awarded by the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division, Orlando, FL.Details of the DealValued at $21.8 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2025.Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will procure one containerized flight training device for CH53K helicopters. It will also deliver associated technical data based on low-rate initial production to support CH-53K Phase II training system efforts.Majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Chantilly, VA.Benefits of the ContractCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Among other combat arsenals and weaponries, military helicopters have been gaining importance owing to advancements and integration of new tactical and logistical features. This has provided ample opportunities for Lockheed to win production and modification contracts for helicopters in recent times. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Such contract wins are likely to drive revenues from the Rotary and Mission Systems business segment, which comprises of the Sikorsky helicopters.Growth ProspectsThe increased defense budget of many nations, as a repercussion of the Russian-Ukraine war, has resulted in a surge in demand for military arms and ammunitions of late. This may have led to increased defense spending on military helicopters as well.Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the military rotorcraft market is likely to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2027.The growth prospects of the military rotorcraft market should benefit Lockheed, along with other defense primes like Textron TXT, Boeing BA and Northrop Grumman NOC, which have already established their position in the military helicopter arena.Textron’s Bell unit provides advanced military helicopters, parts as well as support services to the U.S. government and military customers outside the United States. The unit’s primary U.S. government programs are meant for the production and support of the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft and H-1 helicopters.Story continuesTXT’s long-term earnings growth rate is 11.2%.

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.93%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 9.29%.Coming into today, shares of the homebuilder had gained 6.15% in the past month. In that same time, the Construction sector gained 6.73%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.65%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from PulteGroup as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be July 25, 2023. On that day, PulteGroup is projected to report earnings of $2.46 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 9.89%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $3.94 billion, up 0.43% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.30 per share and revenue of $15.14 billion. These totals would mark changes of -13.89% and -6.68%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for PulteGroup. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends.

We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

(PHM): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-pultegroup-inc-130012601.html,1689080412,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this homebuilder have returned +6.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, which PulteGroup falls in, has gained 7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.46 per share, indicating a change of -9.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.6% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.30 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -13.9%. This estimate has changed +1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.16 indicates a change of -1.5% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PulteGroup is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.94 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $15.14 billion and $15.52 billion estimates indicate -6.7% and +2.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.2%. EPS of $2.35 for the same period compares with $1.83 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.27 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.42%. The EPS surprise was +32.02%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) share price is up 28% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. The last year has been disappointing, with the stock price down 11% in that time.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Johnson &amp; Johnson achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 60% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 5% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Johnson &amp; Johnson's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Johnson &amp; Johnson, it has a TSR of 46% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 15% in the last year, Johnson &amp; Johnson shareholders lost 8.0% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 8%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Johnson &amp; Johnson is showing  4 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Greenblatt’s investment philosophy and his hedge fund’s performance over the years, and go directly to read Joel Greenblatt's Top 5 Stock Picks.Joel Greenblatt, renowned for his expertise in value investing, holds a prominent position among Wall Street's notable investors. In 1985, he established Gotham Capital, a venture that yielded an impressive annualized return of 50% from 1985 to 1994. Recognizing the need for progression, Greenblatt founded Gotham Asset Management in 2008 as a successor to his previous fund. Presently, he assumes the role of Managing Principle and Co-Chief Investment Officer.Greenblatt is most famous for creating the “Magic Formula,"" a systematic methodology that can be used to find and identify value stocks with growth potential. The Magic Formula, as explained by Joel Greenblatt in his book The Little Book that Beats the Market, involves ranking stocks based on two metrics: earnings yield (EBIT/enterprise value) and return on capital (EBIT/invested capital). Greenblatt’s approach to investing can be called a combination of value investing and quality investing. It’s all about buying a high-quality company at an attractive price. Or, viewed from a different angle, buying a cheap company that isn’t a waste. As Greenblatt stated in a 2006 interview with Barron's, the Magic Formula is designed to help investors with “buying good companies, on average, at cheap prices, on average.”However, investors should take note that the Magic Formula is not the Holy Grail of investing. It does not guarantee success, and as with any other strategy, it does involve some level of risk. The strategy relies on historical data and may not perform as well in the future, especially if market conditions were to change. During a backtest conducted to analyze market performance from 2003 to 2015, it was discovered that the Magic Formula strategy yielded annualized returns of 11.4%. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 achieved returns of 8.7%. The author of the backtest observed that while the magic formula strategy did outperform the benchmark, it fell short of the exaggerated claims made in the Little Book.Story continuesIncidentally, Joel Greenblatt’s investment technique seems to have caused his hedge fund to lag behind the broader market. Over the past 5 years, Gotham Large Value Fund (GVALX) has gained only 9.15%, compared with a 12.31% return of the S&amp;P 500.At the close of Q1 2023, Gotham Asset Management's portfolio value surpassed $4.125 billion, marking an increase from the previous quarter's $3.5 billion. The fund maintains a diverse investment strategy, with technology, services, healthcare, and finance sectors occupying significant positions within the portfolio. Noteworthy holdings of Greenblatt in Q1 include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). This article will further delve into Joel Greenblatt's top 10 stock holdings, highlighting his preferred selections.Joel Greenblatt's Return, Portfolio and Magic FormulaJoel Greenblatt of Gotham Asset ManagementOur MethodologyTo make our list of the top stock picks of Joel Greenblatt's Gotham Asset Management for the first quarter of 2023, we took a look at its latest filings with the SEC and picked the 10 investments that the investment fund held the highest stakes in.10.

Airbus hopes to deliver 720 planes in 2023.Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal said in June that the company expects to ramp up MAX production from its current rate of 31 jets per month to 38 ""very soon,"" but will probably encounter supply chain instability with every rate increase.Boeing won net orders for 288 planes last month when factoring in cancelations and conversions, dominated by a monster order from Air India for 190 MAXs, 20 Dreamliners and 10 mini-jumbo 777X jets.

UAL is currently benefiting from its solid air-travel demand and modernizing its fleet. However, a low current ratio is a headwind.Factors Favoring UALOwing to buoyant air-travel demand, United Airlines posted a significant year-over-year increase (about 51.1%) in first-quarter 2023 revenues. The massive year-over-year increase in the top line was driven by a 61.8% rise in passenger revenues (contributing 89.8% to the top line) to $10,274 million.Owing to robust air-travel demand, UAL expects revenues for the June quarter to rise 14-16% year over year.  Driven by the rosy scenario with respect to air-travel demand, it expects second-quarter earnings per share in the $3.50-$4.00 band. For 2023, UAL expects earnings per share in the $10-$12 band.In a bid to modernize its fleet, United Airlines placed the largest 787 Dreamliner order to Boeing in December 2022. UAL will purchase 100 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, with options to buy 100 more.UAL anticipates receiving the delivery of the new widebody planes between 2024 and 2032. The new jets are expected to result in a 25% improvement pertaining to fuel usage compared with the older Boeing 767 widebodies and some 777s that will be placed.As a result of this massive deal, significant job opportunities for pilots, flight attendants and maintenance technicians, among others, are also likely to be created.Key RisksThe decline in current ratio (a measure of liquidity) does not bode well for the company. The carrier exited the first quarter of 2023 with a current ratio of 0.91, down from the reading of 1 in fourth-quarter 2022. A reduction in this key ratio generally suggests that the company's ability to generate cash is on the decline.Zacks RankUAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

CPA and Allegiant Travel Company ALGT.Story continuesCopa Holdings, flaunting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is aided by improved air-travel demand.

The 27-nation bloc announced last year that it was blocking the acquisition, saying it would hurt competitors.“If companies merge before our clearance, they breach our rules. Illumina and Grail knowingly and deliberately did so by implementing their tie-up as we were still investigating,” EU antitrust Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. “This is a very serious infringement.”Regulators worldwide have targeted the deal. The Federal Trade Commission ordered Illumina to sell Grail earlier this year after finding the merger would “stifle competition and innovation in the U.S. market for life-saving cancer tests.”Similiarly, the EU said the acquisition would squeeze out competitors and give Illumina too dominant of a position in the market.San Diego-based Illumina is a major supplier of next-generation sequencing systems for genetic and genomic analysis, while Grail is a health company developing blood tests to try to catch cancer early.Illumina vowed to appeal the European fine — like it did the FTC order — and is waiting for the EU's highest court to rule on its challenge to the commission's ability to review the merger.“We believe that the fine announced by the European Commission today — while expected and accrued for over the last year — is unlawful, inappropriate and disproportionate,” the company said in a statement.The turmoil over the acquisition has stirred upheaval at Illumina. Its CEO and director, Francis deSouza, resigned last month after the company's chairman was voted out by shareholders in May. It followed a monthslong heated battle with activist investor Carl Icahn over the difficulties of the Grail deal, with Icahn urging shareholders to oust both executives.Story continuesCourt arguments in Illumina's appeal of the FTC order to sell Grail are set to begin in September. It comes after a judge handed U.S. regulators a defeat this week in its bid to block Microsoft's blockbuster purchase of video game maker Activision Blizzard.In Europe, regulators imposed the maximum possible fine of 432 million euros, the commission said in a statement. Such fines can reach up to 10% of a company's annual revenue depending on the severity of the infraction.Companies almost invariably play by the rules and wait to complete an acquisition or merger until antitrust authorities have cleared it, the commission said.“Illumina and Grail knowingly and intentionally breached the standstill obligation during the commission’s in-depth investigation,"" the statement said. ""This is an unprecedented and very serious infringement undermining the effective functioning of the EU merger control system.”It insisted that “Illumina strategically weighed up the risk of a gun-jumping fine against the risk of having to pay a high break-up fee if it failed to take over Grail. It also considered the potential profits it could obtain by jumping the gun.”]"

That marks a slight increase from a previous provision of $453 million in the third quarter of last year.The European Commission, which eventually blocked the deal on anti-competitive concerns, declined to comment.

By utilizing Urbint's AI-powered platform, Georgia Power aims to identify and mitigate safety hazards proactively, thereby preventing incidents that can lead to severe injuries or fatalities.Below we explore how the Southern subsidiary uses AI technology to enhance workers’ safety and the implementation’s benefits for the company.BackgroundSO, through its investments in Energy Impact Partners, actively supports emerging technology companies in the energy sector, fostering innovation and improving business processes. One such company is Urbint, which combines AI with real-world data to predict and prevent threats to workers, communities, critical infrastructure and the environment.Partnership for Enhanced SafetyGeorgia Power joined forces with Urbint to implement a Worker Safety pilot at two distribution centers. The collaboration aims to leverage Urbint's AI technology and create a ""smart"" electronic job safety briefing (JSB) with hazard analysis that will be deployed on field crews' iPads.This innovative solution has enabled Georgia Power to proactively identify and address potential safety hazards, thereby providing workers with the necessary information to prevent injuries and accidents during work.Identifying Risks and Recommending Preventive MeasuresThe Urbint platform uses incident and ""near misses"" data (obtained from Georgia Power) to synchronize work site conditions, project data, and Urbint's extensive task and hazard library. By analyzing this information, Urbint's risk engine can identify specific risks associated with each task and evaluate the potential threats.Based on its findings, the platform recommends preventive measures that workers can implement to mitigate the identified risks and ensure optimum safety. This proactive approach allows Georgia Power to create a safer working environment for its employees by preventing potential life-altering injuries.Story continuesLeveraging Safety ScienceIn order to optimize the workers’ wellbeing and achieve full adoption of the electronic JSB, Urbint integrates safety science into an engaging tailboard meeting. This, in turn, fosters workers’ participation and understanding of potential hazards.By creating an interactive and engaging experience for workers, the JSB ensures effective communication and retention of essential safety information.Georgia Power recognizes the importance of its workers' feedback and actively involves its International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers partners, who provide real-time insights to further refine and improve the JSB and its related safety measures.This collaborative approach ensures that the technology addresses worker safety concerns and helps prevent injuries during tasks.Benefits and Future OutlookThe ongoing Worker Safety pilot program between Georgia Power and Urbint holds significant potential for improving workers’ safety and fostering a culture of proactive hazard prevention.As more users embrace the Urbint solution, the collective data (gathered from experiences across the nation) will provide even greater insights for safety precautions, benefiting the entire industry.By combining cutting-edge technology, data analytics and artificial intelligence, Georgia Power aims to create a safer tomorrow for its workers.ConclusionSouthern and its subsidiaries continue to prioritize the wellbeing and safety of their workforce through innovative collaborations and cutting-edge technologies, setting a benchmark for the industry as a whole.Zacks Rank and Key PicksSO is an American utility firm that provides electricity to customers across southern United States.

The new plan goes into effect in January 2024, giving ample time for plan sponsors and employers to opt in.CVS Caremark is a part of the CVS Health company but is separate from the retail pharmacy chain.GoodRx co-founder Doug Hirsch told Yahoo Finance the new relationship gives the company access to 70% of those commercially insured, adding to last year's similar partnership with Cigna's (CI) ExpressScripts.GoodRx currently receives about 200 billion price points per day with its wide variety of PBM and pharmacy relationships.""Everyone likes to think we're like [only serving] low-income people who are just cash pay.

The third biosimilar, Cyltezo, is the first interchangeable biosimilar with HUMIRA and is developed by the German-based drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim.The FDA-approved biosimilars are competitive substitutes for HUMIRA as they are comparatively more affordable and have proved to be clinically effective in treating inflammatory conditions.Thereby, the introduction of more cost-effective biosimilars for inflammatory conditions is a dire need and the information furnished by Express Scripts trend data underlines the reason. The costs of inflammatory medications made up for around 25% of the overall drug spending in the commercial book of business of Express Scripts last year.The advent of varied biosimilars means increased competition in the industry, which often reduces prices and paves the way for enhanced access and choice of treatment for patients. Per Evernorth, competition created among biosimilars is forecasted to create savings between $225 billion and $375 billion for the U.S. healthcare system with regard to total pharmacy expenditures over the next decade.The role of a pharmacy benefit manager like Express Scripts is to work out rebates and fees with drug manufacturers and develop formularies for medications that are covered by insurance. The addition of cost-effective and clinically-effective biosimilars within NPF reflects Cigna’s focus to generate cost savings for its clients. The same is also likely to attract more customers in buying prescription medications from the pharmacy network of CI, which in turn, might boost its pharmacy revenues.Story continuesPharmacy revenues contribute a massive chunk to Cigna’s revenues and the contribution stood at 71.2% for 2022. Cigna boasts an expansive pharmacy network across the United States. On an annual basis, Express Scripts Pharmacy distributes roughly 1.6 billion adjusted prescriptions to pharmacy plan members that are managed by Express Scripts PBM. In fact, CI acquired Express Scripts back in 2018 in order to add strength to its pharmacy business.Shares of Cigna have gained 6.8% in the past three months against the industry’s 11.2% decline.

We've heard from Ed Bastian time and time again that this is the year.JIM SMIGIEL: If we look at big banks and even the broader financial sector, they haven't really participated as much in the year to date rally with earnings kind of expectations already being low. The sector we like is a sector we've been overweight most of the year.STEPHEN BIGGAR: I think it's going to be, you know, not banks' finest hour in terms of earnings this quarter. Clearly, the higher rate environment that was very helpful in 2022 for net interest margins is having a detrimental effect now.

American Banker Reporter Polo Rocha sits down with Yahoo Finance Live to break down earnings estimates for major banks following regional bank failures earlier in 2023 and the future for higher capital requirements from regulators.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Well, banks both big and small are up against rising costs as they shake off the remnants of March's crisis. With large lenders like Citi, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo set to kick off earnings season on Friday, what does the year ahead look like for the sector? With more, we're joined by Polo Rocha, who is American Banker reporter.Good to see you this morning. So as we look at these banks, the conventional wisdom had been that the larger banks would be OK, that they were more insulated from a slowdown in lending, et cetera. How is that going to play out, and is it going to play out as we start to hear from them?POLO ROCHA: Yeah, I think that largely holds up. You know, I think the bigger banks, you know, particularly the retail-focused one, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, they have a pretty big diversified business. I think other banks that are maybe more concentrated on Wall Street deal-making, kind of helping companies finance merger activities, there's been kind of a big slowdown in activity there due to just general economic uncertainty.So those banks might be hit a little bit harder. But I think the big banks-- JPMorgan, Wells Fargo-- they should do just fine. I think the more interesting part of earnings will come later on next week and the week after when some of the regional banks start reporting.BRAD SMITH: You know, the interesting thing was to do a kind of Command-F or Control-F, depending upon what type of PC you're using at home, on deposits when we were combing through some of the earnings call transcripts and even the earnings reports themselves that dropped from the largest banks and even regional banks last quarter. This quarter, if there's anything that you would be kind of laser focused on, what would that be? Would you be looking across investment banking or where some of the kind of corporate client banking stands? Where would you be like laser focused?Story continuesPOLO ROCHA: Well, I think everyone's kind of looking most closely at deposits, you know? I think, you know, with the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, the kind of big panic that-- you know, mini crisis that we saw earlier this spring, those kind of worries have kind of faded. But you know, should any banks kind of report any big surprises on deposits, maybe there'll be some more talk of that. But I think, largely speaking, things have kind of stabilized.But I think the bigger problem now is that banks are kind of facing a slow grind of profitability challenges, deposits-- in order to keep those deposits, right? Because deposits are so important for the banking industry. Banks are having to pay their depositors more, you know? Corporate clients want more interest for the cash that they have at their bank. Consumer clients, you know, they want higher rates on certificates of deposit on their savings. And banks are really having to maintain these deposits and paying up to do so.So some of the banks that kind of face more challenges but are still around, they're paying out a little bit more, and that's kind of driving-- or a lot more, and that's kind of driving competition for deposits across the industry. And that's really the kind of big driver. It's not only the level of deposits. But if you are keeping deposits, how much is that going to cost you for the next year?JULIE HYMAN: Well-- and when we talk about profitability, we also have to talk about regulation, right? We heard from Michael Barr, the vice chair of the Fed who oversees supervision of the banks, yesterday talking about the need to increase capital requirements or increase the threshold under which-- I should say lower the threshold under which some of these banks might be under some of these capital requirements. Do we expect to hear much from the banks themselves, though, during this earnings season? Like are analysts and investors going to start to pressure them to get some hard numbers on the effects that all of this could have?POLO ROCHA: I think so. You know, I think we've seen some hints of what was coming before. Yesterday's speech from Michael Barr, the Fed's vice chair of supervision, really kind of added some more details on what we're going to see. There's still a lot to be fleshed out. But banks have been talking for the last several weeks and months, especially after Silicon Valley Bank's failure, that they don't want regulators to take that hard of a line because that might have ramifications. It might lead to a cutback in lending and even more caution from banks.So you know, I think certainly capital requirements seem to go up or are going to go up for banks. That's always going to be the case for the big banks who are always maybe going to be subject to tougher rules from the current administration. But I think the failure of Silicon Valley Bank has kind of prompted a spread to-- for those rules to apply to regional banks that have, you know, more than $100 billion in assets.They're not mega banks. They're not JPMorgan. They're not Wells Fargo. But they have a kind of big presence in their regions. Those banks are going to face just a higher cost of doing business. They're going to have to have a-- like a bigger piggy bank in case for-- in case there's a recession and they need to, you know, protect their books.They're going to have to set aside more money for a rainy day, and that's just going to lead to fewer loans presumably. Not that much. I think the Fed says it'll be modest, but it certainly will weigh on them in the future. And I think investors are aware of that, and I think that's one of the reasons why bank stocks have-- you know, they've bounced back, but not so much.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of Greenblatt’s investment philosophy and his hedge fund’s performance over the years, and go directly to read Joel Greenblatt's Top 5 Stock Picks.Joel Greenblatt, renowned for his expertise in value investing, holds a prominent position among Wall Street's notable investors. In 1985, he established Gotham Capital, a venture that yielded an impressive annualized return of 50% from 1985 to 1994. Recognizing the need for progression, Greenblatt founded Gotham Asset Management in 2008 as a successor to his previous fund. Presently, he assumes the role of Managing Principle and Co-Chief Investment Officer.Greenblatt is most famous for creating the “Magic Formula,"" a systematic methodology that can be used to find and identify value stocks with growth potential. The Magic Formula, as explained by Joel Greenblatt in his book The Little Book that Beats the Market, involves ranking stocks based on two metrics: earnings yield (EBIT/enterprise value) and return on capital (EBIT/invested capital). Greenblatt’s approach to investing can be called a combination of value investing and quality investing. It’s all about buying a high-quality company at an attractive price. Or, viewed from a different angle, buying a cheap company that isn’t a waste. As Greenblatt stated in a 2006 interview with Barron's, the Magic Formula is designed to help investors with “buying good companies, on average, at cheap prices, on average.”However, investors should take note that the Magic Formula is not the Holy Grail of investing. It does not guarantee success, and as with any other strategy, it does involve some level of risk. The strategy relies on historical data and may not perform as well in the future, especially if market conditions were to change. During a backtest conducted to analyze market performance from 2003 to 2015, it was discovered that the Magic Formula strategy yielded annualized returns of 11.4%. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 achieved returns of 8.7%. The author of the backtest observed that while the magic formula strategy did outperform the benchmark, it fell short of the exaggerated claims made in the Little Book.Story continuesIncidentally, Joel Greenblatt’s investment technique seems to have caused his hedge fund to lag behind the broader market. Over the past 5 years, Gotham Large Value Fund (GVALX) has gained only 9.15%, compared with a 12.31% return of the S&amp;P 500.At the close of Q1 2023, Gotham Asset Management's portfolio value surpassed $4.125 billion, marking an increase from the previous quarter's $3.5 billion. The fund maintains a diverse investment strategy, with technology, services, healthcare, and finance sectors occupying significant positions within the portfolio. Noteworthy holdings of Greenblatt in Q1 include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

This is due to their current downtrodden state following the regional banking crisis from earlier this year.But tread carefully.Financial stocks are lagging in 2023, with the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) flat on a year-to-date basis vs a more than 15% gain for the S&amp;P 500.

This information is used for public and workplace safety, law enforcement purposes, corporate investigations, fraud detection and prevention and healthcare sanctioning and credentialing.Workforce solutions also include income verification, mainly for mortgages, which the analyst said Equifax does not have ""meaningful direct competition."" He expects EFX to stay in the lead ""as the large amount of existing records and the difficulty of convincing employers to share employee information would be too tough for new entrants to overcome.""The analyst expects Equifax to expand its income verification services to auto, card, government services, and employment screening.Why Luxury Stocks are Worth Investing InMarket value: $104.3 billionDividend yield: 2.9%Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.82 (Buy)BlackRock (BLK, $696.17) is the world's largest asset manager with $9 trillion in assets under management (AUM) as of the first quarter of 2023. About 80% of its AUM comes from institutional clients, which tend to be more stable than individual investors, according to Morningstar.As investors flock to passive investments such as index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), BlackRock is well-positioned because passive strategies make up two-thirds of its AUM. Its iShares ETF offerings account for a third of all its managed assets and are the market share leader in the U.S. and globally.The asset management company is diversified as well: Half of its AUM consists of equity assets, 29% is in fixed income, with money market funds, multi-asset classes and alternatives comprising the rest. BlackRock has clients in more than 100 countries – 62% in the Americas, 29% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and 9% in the Asia-Pacific region.According to Morningstar, BlackRock will benefit from an expanding ETF market, improved active fund operations, further adoption of ESG analytics and investing, increased multi-asset and alternatives exposure and continued efforts to use the latest technology.BLK is looking to expand in the Asia-Pacific region as well. It already has an asset management joint venture in China with Temasek and China Construction Bank, the world's second largest bank, aimed at the Chinese market. Notably, BlackRock has gotten Chinese regulatory permission to be one of the first global asset managers to run a wholly owned mutual fund business in China.BlackRock is ""well-positioned to drive superior long-term net new assets and market share gains across asset classes, distribution channels and geographies,"" according to a recent research note from Credit Suisse. And this is why BLK will likely remain on lists of the best financial stocks for years to come.Investing Jargon, ExplainedMarket value: $63.4 billionDividend yield: 1.5%Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.82 (Buy)Intercontinental Exchange (ICE, $113.16) is the parent of the venerable New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the New York Board of Trade and the Chicago Stock Exchange, among other institutions. It operates a total of 10 exchanges and six clearing houses around the world.But the company has been diversifying its revenue sources through acquisitions of businesses in mortgage technology and fixed income and data services, as competition among exchanges remains stiff.In mortgage technology, ICE provides a platform of comprehensive tools for mortgage application up through closing and the secondary market. The fixed income and data services unit offers fixed income pricing, reference data, indices, analytics and execution services plus global credit default swap clearing and multi-asset class data delivery solutions.ICE is currently planning to acquire the loan origination business of Black Knight for $11.7 billion in a 90% cash, 10% stock deal. This acquisition will boost ICE's position as a provider of end-to-end home mortgage services. However, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is suing to block the deal on anti-competitive grounds. The case is ongoing.The current market volatility and rising interest rates have boosted exchange revenue as trading volume increased in certain products. However, they have also held down the mortgage business as demand softened.""Given the macro uncertainty and likely continued market volatility, we think investors will have greater appreciation for the defensive earnings profile of the exchanges,"" according to a recent note from Deutsche Bank.Intercontinental Exchange is a member of the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index, which has outperformed U.S. stocks over time. ICE has also been one of the best financial stocks in terms of price performance, boasting an average annual total return of 14.4% over the past 15 years vs an 11.0% return for the S&amp;P 500.5 Special Situation Stocks for Growth &amp; IncomeMarket value: $15.4 billionDividend yield: 0.5%Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.93 (Buy)Tradeweb Markets (TW, $65.71) was formed in 1996 as an online exchange serving the opaque U.S. Treasuries market. Today, it operates electronic trading platforms for fixed-income products, derivatives and ETFs.TW remains a leader in electronic trading of fixed-income securities, according to Morningstar. Since most fixed-income trading is still done by phone or chat, Tradeweb's electronic marketplace ensures it has a long runway of growth ahead of it, Morningstar analyst Michael Miller wrote.He expects Tradeweb to see low double-digit revenue growth for years to come.However, competition is bound to come as electronic networks become more attractive to traders. ""As Tradeweb rolls out new features like automated trade execution and portfolio trading, the cost advantages of electronic trading networks over traditional methods continues to increase,"" he said. But this transition is still in its early days.In the current environment of market volatility, TW as a trading platform benefits in the form of increased trading volumes, according to a research note from Deutsche Bank.In its latest quarterly earnings report, this top financial stock said average daily trading volume hit a record of $1.4 trillion, up 16% from the year prior. This impressive milestone was notched amid strength in European government bonds, repurchase agreements, retail U.S. government bonds and other securities.Tradeweb launched a new market data service to calculate iNAVs (intraday net asset value) meant to represent a single share of an ETF. BlackRock is the first client for the service. Also, the company is in talks to acquire Yieldbroker, a government bond and derivatives platform for Australia and New Zealand, for AUD 125 million ($83 million).What Is a Single-Stock ETF?Market value: $77.3 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' consensus recommendation: 1.86 (Buy)As the first-ever digital payments platform, PayPal Holdings (PYPL, $69.28) continues to be a leader in e-commerce – and one of Wall Street's best financial stocks – since its founding in 2000.Today, the company has been strengthening its position in the digital payments space through a spate of acquisitions, notably that of mobile payments platform Venmo, and Braintree, which lets businesses accept online payments, both in 2013.Other acquisitions included Xoom, an international money transfer service to 52 countries, Swedish payment processor Zettle, digital coupons company PayPal Honey, mobile payment startup Paydiant and Card.io, whose software lets cameras capture credit card information.But PayPal is facing stiff rising competition from Apple's (AAPL) Apple Pay and Block's (SQ) Cash App, according to Deutsche Bank.The investment bank's fintech survey showed that ""while PayPal continues to be the dominant mobile payment service with 71% of respondents having used the service in the past 12 months, Cash App and Apple Pay both saw large increases in adoption over the past year reaching 46% and 31% adoption, respectively, up from 31% and 23%, respectively.""However, PayPal is off to a strong start this year despite the weakening macroeconomic environment of persistent inflation and rising interest rates. Net revenue grew by 9% to $7 billion in the first quarter, while total payment volume (TPV) rose by 10% to $354.5 billion.Earnings per share (EPS) rose by 33% to $1.17 and operating cash flow was $1.2 billion, with free cash flow coming in at $1 billion.Analysts are expecting steady growth for PYPL's second-quarter results, as well. Current estimates are for EPS to be up nearly 25% year-over-year and revenue to rise 6.9%.""PayPal shares continue to provide exposure to a unique and scaled two-sided network"" with around 400 million users and 35 million merchants on its platform, according to a recent Credit Suisse note.The Pros' Investment Strategies for Today's MarketMarket value: $424.2 billionDividend yield: 2.8%Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.84 (Buy)JPMorgan Chase (JPM, $145.15) is typically found on lists of the best financial stocks to own, and for good reason. It is the largest bank in the U.S. and among the largest in the world, based on assets. It also found itself becoming arguably the most influential financial institution in America following the spring 2023 regional banking crisis.In early May, JPMorgan acquired the majority of First Republic Bank's operations at the behest of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC). The regional bank was collapsing following a bank run that was sparked by the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.""Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,"" said JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, in a statement.First Republic is the third failed bank JPMorgan has taken over, following Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual during the financial crisis of 2008. JPM stepping in has helped to defuse bank depositor panics.These takeovers helped to propel JPMorgan's assets to $3.7 billion at the end of Q1. But above it all is Dimon, who is himself an influential figure in finance.The bank's namesake, John Pierpoint Morgan Sr., famously locked his Wall Street peers in his study until they agreed to join him in bailing out a panic-stricken financial system in 1907, according to The New York Times. ""Not since then has the leader of a single company held such sway over the U.S. financial system,"" the paper said.JPMorgan's 10-year total return of 12.2% on average per year has outpaced the industry, which clocks in at 5.5%. Over a 15-year horizon, JPMorgan returned 11.5% on average per year vs 3.1% for the industry.Stock Picks That Billionaires LoveMarket value: $158.8 billionDividend yield: 2.8%Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.81 (Buy)Wells Fargo (WFC, $42.32) is one of the country's Big Four banks, along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C). It also has a broad network of retail branches. The bank is one of the largest issuers of credit and debit cards, as well, and is a leader in commercial banking and consumer financial products, according to Morningstar.The bank also is slowly emerging from its 2016 fake accounts scandal and regulatory punishments in which the Fed imposed a cap on its asset size. ""We're already starting to see glimpses of the transition to offense from defense,"" Morningstar analyst Eric Compton wrote.These include the launch of several new card products, the advisor count not declining for the first time in years and $2.2 billion of incremental internal investments in 2023. However, a full turnaround could take years.Despite headwinds, Wells Fargo has the third most deposits in the U.S. after JPMorgan and Bank of America.Compton believes Wells Fargo still has a wide competitive moat due to cost advantages and the reluctance of most depositors to switch banks. The financial firm has lower costs due to its large scale and breadth of products.Wells Fargo is large enough to be considered a global systemically important bank, too. The top financial stock is also a member of the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index, which tracks the lowest-priced companies with competitive advantages that are expected to last more than 20 years into the future.Four Random Facts and Thoughts About Warren BuffettMarket value: $130.0 billionDividend yield: 0.7%Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.72 (Buy)Intuit (INTU, $464.33) is the financial giant behind TurboTax, the do-it-yourself tax filing service and software, as well as QuickBooks, the popular bookkeeping software for small businesses and sole proprietors. It also owns popular email marketing firm, Mailchimp, and credit-scoring firm Credit Karma.The company has been expanding its total addressable market by offering to do taxes for consumers and small businesses. In this year's Super Bowl, it debuted a commercial that tells people they can ""Come to TurboTax and don't do your taxes."" Instead, taxpayers will be matched with a tax expert who will prepare and file their taxes in just one meeting.Intuit is doing the same with QuickBooks by evolving it into a portfolio of expert services available to small businesses. In the second quarter, it launched a free service in which experts guide QuickBook through its new suite of offerings.With Credit Karma, INTU is adding new services such as users getting tax refunds as quickly as one minute after the IRS accepts their tax returns. This and other new services are aimed at making Credit Karma into a ""comprehensive, self-driving financial platform,"" said Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi, on a recent earnings call.Intuit continues to expect double-digit annual revenue growth for 2023, although it is lower than prior years amid macroeconomic pressures.Still, INTU is one of the best financial stocks, as evidenced by its consensus Buy rating. Deutsche Bank is among those that has a Buy rating on Intuit, saying the company enjoys higher average revenue per return for TurboTax, driven by its premium offerings such as full service.What's more, Intuit is a member of the outperforming Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index.Best Index Funds for a Low-Priced PortfolioMarket value: $371.6 billionDividend yield: 0.6%Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.50 (Strong Buy)Mastercard (MA, $392.16) needs no introduction for anyone with a credit card. It is the second most accepted card in the world, after Visa (V). The card company benefits from a network effect in which the more consumers join the payment network, the more attractive the network becomes to merchants.Mastercard's business has stayed resilient in the face of a softening economy. In the first quarter, net revenue rose by a higher-than-expected 11% from the prior year.As a result, BMO Capital Markets raised its estimates and 12-month target price to $442 from $414. The stock is rated Outperform, or the equivalent of Buy.""Mastercard has yet to observe weakness in consumer spending,"" according to a recent BMO research note. ""We do not anticipate any near-term impact from the announced Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation.""In April, Mastercard received a ""civil investigative demand"" (CID) from the DOJ's antitrust division about its debit card program. In January, Visa got a CID from the DOJ over its debit card transactions.Credit Suisse reiterated its Outperform rating on the stock. It also raised its 2023 EPS estimate by a dime to $12.35 and 2024 by 29 cents to $14.72.""We continue to believe that Mastercard has attractive qualities in the current environment,"" including its profitability, balanced exposure, ability to grow through moderate recessionary conditions, and other advantages, the research firm wrote in a note to clients.BMO and Credit Suisse are hardly alone in thinking MA is one of the best financial stocks around. As proof, it is the only name on this list with a consensus Strong Buy rating, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.Best Retirement Stocks to Buy Now]"
200,bbc94662-ea8b-3336-8f9b-204a96b20ef6,PYPL,2023-07-12,Brokers Suggest Investing in Paypal (PYPL): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-paypal-pypl-133007233.html,1689082207,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Paypal (PYPL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Paypal currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.70, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 33 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.70 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 21 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 63.6% and 3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PYPLBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PYPLCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Paypal here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Paypal, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in PYPL?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Paypal, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.95.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Paypal.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Khare said using its own chips could lower cloud service costs because they are very power efficient.IBM announced the chip's existence in October but did not disclose the manufacturer or how it would be used.Khare said the chip is manufactured by Samsung Electronics, which has partnered with IBM on semiconductor research, and that his company is considering it for use in watsonx.IBM has no set date for when the chip could be available for use by cloud customers, but Khare said the company has several thousand prototype chips already working.IBM has joined other tech giants such as Alphabet's Google and Amazon.com in designing its own AI chips.But Khare said IBM was not trying to design a direct replacement for semiconductors from Nvidia, whose chips lead the market in training AI systems with vast amounts of data.Instead, IBM's chip aims to be cost-efficient at what AI industry insiders call inference, which is the process of putting an already trained AI system to use making real-world decisions.""That's where the volume is right now,"" Khare said.

These results would represent year-over-year changes of +2.08% and +2.26%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM should also be noted by investors.

205,6db3fb13-aaad-30c9-881b-024a844a2f5d,IBM,2023-07-12,Sustainability in the Age of AI,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sustainability-age-ai-131500255.html,1689081300,STORY,['IBM'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / July 11, 2023 / IBMIBM, Tuesday, July 11, 2023, Press release pictureTo achieve a step-change in business performance, organizations are combining technology modernization and sustainability into their core business processes. To do this requires improving user support tools that can help business leaders with the increasingly complex decisions needed to optimize across cost, service level, working capital and sustainability.Generative AI is a catalyst for transforming business, and the technology is capturing the attention of business leaders around the world. As CEOs respond and embrace generative AI, they are faced with the Herculean task of both moving at pace-responsibly-while maintaining business, employee and shareholder trust.What CEOs are saying about generative AIThe annual CEO study*, CEO decision-making in the age of AI, Act with intention, found that 75% of CEOs surveyed believe that competitive advantage will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI.CEOs identify productivity or profitability as their highest business priority-up from sixth place in 2022, according to the IBM Institute for Business Value's new CEO study. These leaders also recognize technology modernization is key to achieving their productivity goals, ranking it as their second highest priority. Yet CEOs face key barriers as they race to modernize and adopt new technologies like generative AI.CEOs firmly believe in the benefits of generative AI across their organization but, when it comes to AI readiness, there appears to be a disconnect with their executive teams. While 69% of CEO respondents see broad benefits of generative AI across their organization, just 29% of their executive teams agree they have the in-house expertise to adopt generative AI.What does a struggle with AI mean for sustainability?Despite a shift in their priorities, sustainability remains a key challenge for business leaders. CEOs cite environmental sustainability as their top challenge over the next three years. What is preventing executives from moving the needle towards their larger goals? Leaders point to factors such as struggling to manage manual data, unclear ROI and economic benefits, lack of insights from data, and regulatory barriers as the top three biggest challenges in achieving sustainability objectives.Story continuesThe fact is, sustainability and profitability can go hand-in-hand. Forward-thinking organizations are leveraging sustainability as an opportunity to drive their business forward and establish greater transparency around their sustainability commitments.Creating a balanced sustainability/profitability roadmap is a powerful first step to driving organizations forward during the age of AI. This roadmap can help leaders identify opportunities and gaps in the current IT environment, which will help with more informed decision-making. Applying data and AI against sustainability goals is one way leaders can help drive productivity.It appears that corporate boardrooms are taking note of the connection between sustainability and profitability and are holding CEOs accountable for their company's sustainability efforts. In fact, the percentage of CEOs with compensation linked to specific sustainability measures has more than tripled from 2022 to more than 50% this year.Modernizing IT environments can help organizations make sense of their data and progress towards their sustainability goals in several ways, including:AI implementation that automates manual data and transforms it into usable outputs without compromising the data's security or reliabilityGreen IT solutions that can help reduce an enterprise's IT carbon footprint and even reduce up to 30% of computing costsAdvanced analytics platforms that provide transparent sustainability data management across value chains with a single point of truth for sustainability analysis data and create greater transparencyLearn more about sustainability, CEOs and the role of AISustainability is still a team sport, and it takes leadership across the enterprise to bring real, sustainable change.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Petrobras (PBR) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.85 a share, just 16 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 27, 2023.PBR has an Earnings ESP figure of 11.84%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.85 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.76.PBR is just one of a large group of Oils-Energy stocks with a positive ESP figure. Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Marathon Petroleum is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on August 1, 2023. MPC's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.82 a share 21 days from its next earnings release.Story continuesMarathon Petroleum's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.24% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.81.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, PBR and MPC could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Escalated input, freight and packaging costs, along with higher advertising and marketing expenses, may continue to be headwinds for the industry participants. However, companies in the alcohol space are placed to benefit from the continued recovery across markets and channels, robust demand for premium and high-quality products, and innovative spirits. The diversification of product portfolios of alcohol companies has been helping boost their top lines. Companies are expected to benefit from the momentum in spirits and ready-to-drink (RTD) cocktails.Investments in product innovations, premiumization and technology platforms bode well for players like Constellation Brands Inc. STZ, Brown-Forman (BF.B), Molson Coors TAP, The Boston Beer Company SAM and The Duckhorn Portfolio NAPA.About the IndustryThe Zacks Beverages – Alcohol industry mainly comprises producers, importers, exporters, marketers and sellers of alcoholic beverages like beer, craft beer, ciders, wine, rum, whiskey, liqueurs, vodka, tequila, champagnes, brandy, amaretto, RTD cocktails and malt. Some industry players also produce and sell non-alcoholic beverages like carbonated soft drinks, sparkling waters, bottled water, energy drinks, powdered and natural juices, and RTD teas. The companies sell products through wholesalers and retailers like supermarkets, warehouse clubs, grocery stores, convenience stores, package stores, drug stores and other retail outlets. The industry participants also sell beer directly to consumers in cans and bottles at restaurants, pubs, bars and liquor stores. Some brewers operate brewpubs or taste rooms at breweries, offering consumers the freshest beer.What's Shaping the Future of Beverages - Alcohol IndustrySupply-Chain Disruptions &amp; Higher Freight Costs: Players in the alcohol industry have been enduring pressures from the ongoing supply-chain constraints, and the impacts of inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. The industry players have been experiencing elevated ingredient and other input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees, secondary packaging materials, and increased outbound freight costs, leading to increased costs of sales and higher operating costs. These have been resulting in adverse gross and operating margins for beverage companies.Elevated Costs: Apart from elevated input and packaging costs, players in the alcohol industry are anticipated to witness higher advertising and promotional expenses, as well as SG&amp;A costs, further threatening profitability. Rising brand investments, particularly in media, advertising, production and local marketing, and increased freight to distributors due to higher volumes are resulting in elevated advertising, promotional and selling expenses. Growing external costs, increased compensation expenses and higher discretionary spending are expected to drive SG&amp;A deleverage. Most industry players expect the trend to continue in the near term, impacting profitability to some extent.Premiumization &amp; Product Diversification: Premiumization has been a key growth driver for players in the alcohol space due to consumers’ continued desires for refreshing and newer tastes. Many beverage companies are diversifying their product offerings to capture more sales. Alcohol companies have also been witnessing robust demand trends for premium and high-end products. As a result, the companies focused on innovation and portfolio premiumization stand to gain from today’s market. Players have been exploring opportunities beyond the traditional beer, whiskey, spirits and wine categories. Some popular variations, which have gained traction, include RTD spirits like canned wine and cocktails, hard seltzers, cider, and flavored malt beverages. To capitalize on the priority and consumer trends, companies have been resorting to innovative products. Notably, RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing alcohol segment. Many companies in the industry have collaborated to grow their shares in the fast-growing RTD category.E-Commerce Development &amp; Pricing Gains: Alcohol companies have been benefiting from the rise of e-commerce, and the recovery across markets and channels, boosting volume. Investments in online and e-commerce portals have gained prominence. Companies have been investing in the latest capabilities, and leveraging technology to better connect with customers and consumers. With a recovery in markets and channels, and the expansion of digital capabilities, players in the alcohol space look well-poised for growth. Additionally, companies have been benefiting from price increases and supply productivity savings, offsetting the effects of cost inflation. Effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution have been boosting the sale of alcohol companies.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Beverages – Alcohol industry is an 18-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

That is because the Jan 19, 2024 $13.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for AES shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, AES is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Utility - Electric Power industry that ranks in the Top 27% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 35 cents per share to 29 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about AES right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Now, some dealers are telling the Detroit Free Press they are concerned about losing customers over the change. Yahoo Finance Automotive Reporter Pras Subramanian has the details.Video Transcript- Car dealers appear increasingly concerned over GM's decision to phase out smartphone mirroring software like CarPlay from its vehicles. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian has this story for us. And Pras, why are we seeing some concern here over the move that we knew it was coming from GM?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, well, I guess now we're hearing that some dealers are kind of concerned that buyers may not-- they may balk at GM products here. Because what GM wants to do is they want to introduce their new kind of infotainment system in their newest EV starting with a Blazer EV coming out this fall.So the free press-- Detroit Free Press spoke to some dealers, and they talk about how if CarPlay ain't broke, why are you fixing it. Why are we doing this. Why are we kind of making this big change for these new products coming out that are a big deal compared to the Ford Mustang Mach-E and cars like that. Kia EV6s of the world.There's a big concern there as this change is happening. Why are they making these changes with a very popular product. I mean, Apple says-- Apple says that about 80% of users want CarPlay in their car. Consumer Reports says around 55, 60% of users love CarPlay. They don't want to not have it. So this is kind of a conundrum for GM as to why they're doing it.I mean, we get it why. It's because they want to get to add on subscription fees, new services, new data they can get in versus giving up to Apple. So that's sort of why they're doing it, but it might backfire on them.- And Pras, you've written about this before about these additional sources of revenue, specifically looking at subscription models. I mean, how does GM's actions stack up against what we've seen from some of their other competitors?Story continuesPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So we spoke to Ford at their capital markets stand. And they're talking about making a software-defined vehicle. One that kind of runs on one single OS. And you can-- they can, of course, then update via over-the-air updates. They can add apps to it that people will actually subscribe to. So it's not unheard of.But what Ford's not doing is getting rid of CarPlay. The Ford CEO Jim Farley said that our users want CarPlay, we're not going to get rid of it. We can't do better than what Apple is doing, so they're going to keep that. And competitors like Kia Hyundai's of the world, they are sticking with CarPlay. Mercedes BMW also with CarPlay. So you can see that GM is potentially out there on an Island along with Tesla and Rivian. But those two actually have a more developed ecosystem for their EV products.- We'll see whether or not it'll hurt sales of the GM vehicles here coming up. All right. Pras, thanks.]"

For more stocks on this list, head on over to 5 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Now.The macroeconomic landscape in the United States, which has been a focal point in headlines and the stock market for over two years, is undergoing a rapid transformation. Just a year ago, investors' primary concerns revolved around interest rates and heightened inflation. However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent commodity shock, along with pandemic-induced stimulatory spending, compelled the Federal Reserve to swiftly increase interest rates. As the market enters the second half of 2023, the Federal Reserve's decisive approach to interest rate hikes is finally bringing about some clarity regarding an economic cooldown.Earlier this June, Fed officials made predictions indicating their intention to raise interest rates twice more within the year, assuming these adjustments would be made in quarter-point increments. However, that does not mean that the Fed must hurt the labor market to achieve policymakers’ goals. In fact, Fed Chair Powell has acknowledged that wages are not necessarily the primary factor driving current inflation. He has noted that wages and inflation often exhibit a correlated relationship, but determining which one is causing the other is challenging to determine.As the July 7 payrolls report approached, traders were preparing for a potentially impactful event. Surprisingly robust data released by the ADP Research Institute a day prior had convinced the market that job growth in the US was still ""too strong"" from the perspective of central bankers cautious about inflation. According to the report, US employers added 209,000 jobs in June, falling short of Wall Street expectations. This led to concerns that the Federal Reserve might implement tighter monetary policy. However, the outcome presented a more nuanced view of the labor market, indicating a moderate slowdown that aligns with the Fed's objectives, albeit at a slower pace than anticipated by some. Investors widely expect the Fed to raise interest rates at their July meeting, and the strength of the labor market could help to shape the outlook after that.Story continuesThese are all developments affecting the market in the short-term. If you are a long-term investor who is looking for forever stocks to buy as we do in our monthly newsletter, you hope that the stock market declines by at least 20% to buy your favorite stocks at a discount. At the end of September 2022, the market provided such an opportunity. We don't think we are going to get another opportunity in the near future and this may be relatively the best time to buy.As the market closed the first half of this year with a positive boost from a reassuring inflation report, the notion of acquiring the best ""forever stocks"" might appear overly cautious. With market sentiment strong and supported by seemingly justifiable factors, investors may lean towards riskier securities with higher potential returns. However, it's important to acknowledge that long-term stock investments hold their own value and significance. With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some potential forever stocks, out of which the top picks include the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc.

Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) ranks among the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a decent stock for long-term investments.12.

The company ended the first quarter of 2023 with 174.8 million domains in the .com/.net base, which was 1 million more than it ended in the same quarter a year ago.By the end of this year’s first quarter, 37 of the 943 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey’s database had held a stake in the company. Following Warren Buffett, Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)'s largest shareholder, which owns 3.1 million shares that are worth $672 million.10. The Kroger Co.

The firm also states that the tone will likely remain mixed until the market gains more confidence in Kroger's intermediate-term outlook and that this will likely leave the stock range-bound for ""the foreseeable future.""Insider Monkey took a look at 943 hedge funds for their first quarter of 2023 investments and found out that 43 had owned The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)’s shares. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns a $2.5 billion stake in the company.Oakmark Funds, advised by Harris Associates, made the following comment about The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption.”9.

The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Established in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is a prominent American multinational corporation renowned for its production of the iconic Coca-Cola beverage. In addition to its flagship product, the company is involved in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse array of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even some alcoholic beverages within the beverage industry. As one of the largest beverage corporations globally, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) holds a significant position among the long-term investments of renowned value investor Warren Buffett. Buffett, who has maintained a stake in the company since 2010, has famously expressed his unwavering commitment to retain his shares in the company.On June 6, HSBC analyst Carlos Laboy lowered the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $74 from $77 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”7. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73General Motors, formally the General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), is an American multinational automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, United States.During the initial quarter of 2023, the company experienced an impressive 11.1% growth in revenue compared to the previous year, reaching nearly $40 billion.

Additionally, the analyst increased the price target on the stock from $35 to $38. Recognizing General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) as one of the leading companies in the auto sector, Jones included it in his list of the ""top 5"" automotive companies.According to Insider Monkey’s Q1 2023 database, 73 hedge funds disclosed long positions in General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), worth roughly $4 billion. Of these, investment firm Harris Associates holds a significant position as a shareholder.6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American multinational consumer goods corporation headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. The company provides branded consumer packaged goods worldwide, operating through Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segments.On April 11, the company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.9407 per share, marking a 3% increase. With this raise, the company extended its impressive streak of dividend growth to 67 years, solidifying its position as not only one of the top dividend aristocrat stocks on our list, but also one of the best forever stock.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), compared to 74 funds in the preceding quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.94 million shares valued at $735.2 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”Much like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a top 'forever' stock finding favor with hedge funds.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Now.

That’s because drivers really like to use Apple CarPlay when driving.At Apple’s WWDC event last year, the company said CarPlay was available in an astounding 98% of new cars sold last year and that 79% of new car buyers would only consider purchasing a vehicle that’s CarPlay compatible. In addition, Consumer Reports found in a recent survey that 57% of respondents were “very satisfied” with CarPlay, compared to 50% satisfaction with the automaker’s built-in system.GM says it will instead offer a new integrated infotainment system that leverages Google (GOOGL) built-in applications for cars (i.e., Maps, Assistant, PlayStore), in addition to apps such as Spotify (SPOT) and Audible (AMZN).Nonetheless, GM’s dealers are very concerned. Several dealers told the Detroit Free Press that they're worried new buyers will seek out automakers that plan to offer CarPlay indefinitely.“CarPlay’s not broken. Why fix it?” a source in close contact with multiple GM dealers told the paper. “The risk of failure is very high.”A rendering of Apple's next-generation CarPlay experience (Apple)GM says its new built-in infotainment system will debut in the 2024 Chevy Blazer EV, coming out later this year.“If we're going to take that feature out of our vehicles, we need to respond with a program and a customer package that is equally as compelling, if not more compelling,” GM CFO Paul Jacobson said to Yahoo Finance earlier this year. “We think with the partnership we have with Google, and ultimately with the vehicle data we have, we can create an experience that customers are going to love.""Longtime industry analyst Karl Brauer of iseecars.com understands why GM made the decision to drop CarPlay, but said the move could be a costly one.Story continues“Like most corporate decisions, this one is driven by revenue in the hyper-subscription world we now occupy. And like most hyper-subscription-driven decisions — I’m looking at you, BMW and Ford — this one will backfire,” Brauer told Yahoo Finance. “GM’s position is that its Google-based system is better than Apple CarPlay. If true, they can continue to offer both CarPlay and the Google system with full confidence consumers will choose the Google system…right?”It seems GM isn’t going to offer all three systems and see which one the user prefers, to the chagrin of prospective GM buyers and dealers. And this is likely because of the bottom line.The Chevrolet Blazer EV on display during the 2023 New York International Auto Show (NYIAS) at the Javits Center on April 5, 2023, in New York City. Photo by: NDZ/STAR MAX/IPx (NDZ/STAR MAX/IPx)GM is aiming to collect more of its own data to not only better understand drivers, but also to pad its longer-term profit margins. GM told investors this spring it's looking to achieve profit margins of more than 20% on ""new businesses"" by 2030, which presumably include services like its infotainment system that it could charge fees for add-on features.This isn’t anything new in the auto industry — Tesla has been offering subscription services for years now. Call it the ""Netflix Effect,"" and most automakers are looking to get in on the game too. GM’s crosstown rival Ford is looking to build a “software-defined vehicle” that can be updated over the air with ease while having the ability to charge users for add-on features.But the big difference here is Ford CEO Jim Farley won’t get rid of CarPlay. “70% of our Ford customers in the US are Apple customers. Why would I go to an Apple customer and say, ‘Good luck’?” Farley said earlier this year. “That doesn’t seem very customer-centric, and Apple does a really good job.”However, companies that do chase revenue streams like subscription fees will need to prove that their offerings are a customer value-add, or at least as Farley puts it, be customer-centric.“When consumers can’t immediately see the value in a subscription fee, such as charging for things that used to be free — like BMW charging for CarPlay — or simply charging too much — like Ford cranking the price of BlueCruse — consumers react,” iseecar.com’s Brauer said. “And the reaction doesn’t reflect well on the company, often driving customers away.”Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

213,8ca4deac-d321-32f4-997d-a3a88817d186,GM,2023-07-12,Auto Roundup: STLA Steals the Spotlight With a Slew of Updates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/auto-roundup-stla-steals-spotlight-133400157.html,1689082440,STORY,"['STLAM.MI', 'F', 'GM']","[Last week, auto biggies reported second quarter US vehicle sales numbers. Most automakers experienced year-over-year sales growth, thanks to improving inventory levels. The demand for automobiles remains strong, indicating that the rise in interest rates has not yet significantly affected purchasing decisions.The seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate for June 2023 was 15.7-15.8 million vehicles, up from 15.1 million vehicles in May 2023 and 12.9 million units in June 2022. Per Cox Automotive, new vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2023 topped 4 million units, up 15% year over year and 13% sequentially.U.S. auto giant General Motors GM successfully retained its position as the largest automaker in the country during the January-June period. Close peer Ford F continued its hot streak as America’s #1 brand for six consecutive months this year, driven by the success of its trucks, electric vehicles and new vehicle introductions. Germany-based auto biggie Volkswagen VWAGY hit the gas pedal on its autonomous future, kicking off trials in Austin.Last but not the least, Italian American automaker Stellantis STLA ruled last week’s headlines with several updates. Revolutionizing the EV market, the company unveiled the 600e SUV— a blend of classic charm and cutting-edge technology. It also announced that its Stellantis' (STLA) Mirafiori Site in Italy is set to become the next 'grEEn-campus' location. The transformation is part of the company's Dare Forward Strategy to reach carbon net zero by 2038. Additionally, the automaker unveiled its STLA Medium platform, marking a significant step forward in Stellantis' commitment to sustainable mobility.Last Week’s Top Stories1. General Motors reported a rise of 19% in U.S. vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2023 from the year-ago quarter’s levels. During the second quarter, GM sold 691,978 new vehicles, up from 582,401 vehicles during the second quarter of 2022 and 600,000 vehicles during the first quarter of 2023.During the first half of the year, General Motors sold 1,295,186 new vehicles. Its retail sales increased by 15%, whereas its GM Envolve business moved north by 30%. GM also retained its top spot as the country’s largest auto manufacturer for the first half of the year. Year over year, sales of GM’s Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC increased by 17%, 15%, 48% and 18%, respectively.Story continuesDuring the first half of 2023, GM reported EV sales of 36,300 units or only 2.8% of total sales. The automaker anticipated producing 50,000 EVs during the first six months of the year and expects to produce 100,000 during the last six months. The Chevrolet Bolt models that contributed to nearly 93% of total EV sales in the first half of the year will be discontinued later this year. During the next half of 2023, GM is set to launch new EV models, including Chevrolet Silverado EV Work Truck, Chevrolet Silverado EV RST First Edition, Chevrolet Blazer EV, Chevrolet Equinox EV, Cadillac CELESTIQ EV and Cadillac ESCALADE IQ EV.2. Ford recorded sales growth of 11.2% during the second quarter of 2023. The F-Series once again became America’s top-selling truck, with a 34% rise in sales in the reported quarter. During the first half of 2023, F-Series sales went up by 27.9%, giving it an edge over General Motors’ Silverado by over 118,000 trucks. Ford truck sales gained momentum in the second quarter due to the strong performance of the new Super Duty and improved inventory flow. In the first half of 2023, Ford truck sales totaled 549,625, greater than GM’s truck and van sales by nearly 61,000 trucks.In the second quarter, F-150 Lightning sales went up by 119% compared with the year-ago quarter. Ford’s EV sales rose 11.9% year-to-date. Maverick sales increased by 7.8% in the second quarter. The combined sales of F-Series, Ranger and Maverick increased 26.7% compared with the year-ago quarter. With sales of 32,031, Transit retained the crown of America’s best-selling truck. Ford E-Series van sales rose 63.7% in the reported quarter and rose 55.7% during the first half of 2023. Navigator’s Q2 sales increased by 20.1%, while new Lincoln Corsair sales rallied 27% in June. Nautilus sales also saw a rise of 58.5% in June. BlueCruise, driver assistance technology by Ford, has now surpassed 90 million hands-free driven miles cumulatively.3. Volkswagen announced that it would commence testing autonomous electric vehicles in Austin, TX. Following the decision to wind down its investment in Argo AI — once a leader in self-driving tech, which was dissolved in 2022 due to mounting costs and strategic disagreements between its main investors Volkswagen and Ford — VWAGY has been actively revamping its self-driving strategy.In collaboration with technology firm Mobileye, Volkswagen developed autonomous driving capabilities for its ID Buzz electric vans. VWAGY plans to deploy about 10 of its ID Buzz electric vans, fitted with autonomous driving systems developed in association with MBLY, by the end of 2023. The first pair of these vans, equipped with lidar, radar and camera systems, are already on the U.S. soil. Testing is set to begin before the end of July. Initial tests will have human safety drivers onboard.This development is part of Volkswagen's recent strategic shifts to bolster its self-driving vision, including a strengthened partnership with Mobileye and fresh investments in MOIA, its European ride-sharing arm. Though the firm is aiming to launch a robotaxi service in Europe, it currently doesn't intend to initiate its ride-sharing platform in the United States. Instead, the company plans to market autonomous ID Buzz vans and fleet management capabilities to other businesses offering ride-sharing or delivery services.4. Stellantis announced that its Mirafiori Site, located in Turin, Italy, has joined the grEEn-campus workplace transformation program. The program aims to enhance the company’s automotive design, research and development and central operations through inventive, environment-friendly and collaborative designs. Along with Mirafiori, sites in Poissy, France and Rüsselsheim, Germany, are also part of Stellantis’ grEEn-campus program. The program supports the company’s Dare Forward 2030 strategy of achieving carbon net zero by 2038. The Mirafiori project is expected to be completed by 2025.In another development, Stellantis unveiled its newest EV, the Fiat 600e, marking a significant addition to its portfolio and the brand's return to the B-segment. The model follows the legacy of its predecessor, the Fiat 600 from the 1950s, mirroring its commitment to family-friendly features but supercharging it with state-of-the-art technology and design upgrades.With a starting price below $40,000 (€36,490), Fiat 600e is part of the fiercely competitive crossover market and directly competes with upcoming models like the Volvo EX30. By leveraging its affordable price, impressive range and spacious interior, Fiat aims to attract customers seeking a compact electric SUV that combines style and practicality.In yet another news, Stellantis unveiled STLA Medium platform. Two years ago, the company announced its plans to introduce four global EV platforms, the STLA Small, Medium, Large and Frame. The STLA Medium platform will be the first of the four to hit production, beginning in Europe, later this year. Designed with several propulsion configurations, it is built to accommodate a variety of dimensions, suspensions and wheelbases, thus demonstrating its modular nature. As a fully-electric setup, the STLA Medium can offer a standard range of over 500 km, which can be extended to 700 km with a “performance pack.”The STLA Medium platform is instrumental in Stellantis' strategic plan, Dare Forward 2030, which targets a 100% passenger car battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales mix in Europe and a 50% mix in the United States by 2030.Stellantis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

214,0b3682e5-bca0-35e7-a634-94b1ac2b1a5d,GM,2023-07-12,Is Trending Stock General Motors Company (GM) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-general-motors-company-130010965.html,1689080410,STORY,['GM'],"[General Motors Company (GM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this company have returned +8.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.7% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which General Motors Company belongs, has gained 10.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.66 per share, indicating a change of +45.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +6.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.94 points to a change of -8.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.74 indicates a change of -3% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for General Motors Company.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $41.7 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +16.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $165.32 billion and $167.56 billion estimates indicate +5.5% and +1.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $39.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.1%. EPS of $2.21 for the same period compares with $2.09 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.38%. The EPS surprise was +34.76%.Over the last four quarters, General Motors Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We estimate that over 150,000 customers on United alone were impacted this weekend because of FAA staffing issues and their ability to manage traffic.""Kirby met with Acting FAA Administrator Polly Trottenberg, who has been on the job since June 8, the sources said. In remarks at a Politico forum on Tuesday, Kirby struck a new tone, saying the FAA had been ""particularly helpful, responsive and communicative"" in the last two weeks.""It's been the best two weeks that we've ever had,"" he said.Kirby added the FAA responded well to thunderstorms on Sunday that forced cancellation of about 30% of New York-area airline flights, including at its Newark hub.""They deserve a lot of credit for what they have been doing the last few weeks because they're 54% staffed in New York and to have that event be managed and contained was some heroic efforts,"" Kirby said.Asked about Trottenberg's previously unreported meeting with Kirby, an FAA spokesperson declined to confirm or deny the meeting but said the agency ""will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem."" United declined to comment on the meeting.The FAA is experiencing serious air traffic control staffing issues, notably in New York. A government audit said staffing issues pose risks to the continuity of air traffic operations. U.S. airlines, including United, have urged more air traffic-control hiring. Kirby said in a separate July 1 memo after severe weather forced additional flight disruptions that it would reduce flights in Newark. ""Newark has more flights scheduled than the physical infrastructure can handle,"" Kirby said on Tuesday. Kirby said in that memo he had recent ""constructive conversations"" with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and the FAA.He also apologized on June 30 for taking a private jet home during severe weather saying it ""was the wrong decision because it was insensitive to our customers who were waiting to get home.""

UAL is currently benefiting from its solid air-travel demand and modernizing its fleet. However, a low current ratio is a headwind.Factors Favoring UALOwing to buoyant air-travel demand, United Airlines posted a significant year-over-year increase (about 51.1%) in first-quarter 2023 revenues. The massive year-over-year increase in the top line was driven by a 61.8% rise in passenger revenues (contributing 89.8% to the top line) to $10,274 million.Owing to robust air-travel demand, UAL expects revenues for the June quarter to rise 14-16% year over year.  Driven by the rosy scenario with respect to air-travel demand, it expects second-quarter earnings per share in the $3.50-$4.00 band. For 2023, UAL expects earnings per share in the $10-$12 band.In a bid to modernize its fleet, United Airlines placed the largest 787 Dreamliner order to Boeing in December 2022. UAL will purchase 100 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, with options to buy 100 more.UAL anticipates receiving the delivery of the new widebody planes between 2024 and 2032. The new jets are expected to result in a 25% improvement pertaining to fuel usage compared with the older Boeing 767 widebodies and some 777s that will be placed.As a result of this massive deal, significant job opportunities for pilots, flight attendants and maintenance technicians, among others, are also likely to be created.Key RisksThe decline in current ratio (a measure of liquidity) does not bode well for the company. The carrier exited the first quarter of 2023 with a current ratio of 0.91, down from the reading of 1 in fourth-quarter 2022. A reduction in this key ratio generally suggests that the company's ability to generate cash is on the decline.Zacks RankUAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are Copa Holdings, S.A. CPA and Allegiant Travel Company ALGT.Story continuesCopa Holdings, flaunting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is aided by improved air-travel demand. We are encouraged by the company’s initiatives to modernize its fleet. CPA's focus on its cargo segment is also impressive. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.For second-quarter and full-year 2023, CPA’s earnings are expected to register 919% and 89% surge, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Allegiant, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is seeing a steady recovery in air-travel demand. In first-quarter 2023, operating revenues grew 29.9% on a year-over-year basis.ALGT has a strong liquidity position. Cash and cash equivalents of $317.6 million at first-quarter 2023 end was higher than the current debt of $289.7 million.

222,a697a05c-7485-39c2-9eb6-3838e9991dc6,PNC,2023-07-12,PNC Financial (PNC) to Post Q2 Earnings: What's in Store?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pnc-financial-pnc-post-q2-173600442.html,1689096960,STORY,['PNC'],"[The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC is scheduled to report its second-quarter 2023 earnings before the opening bell on Jul 18. The company’s revenues are expected to have witnessed a year-over-year improvement, while its earnings are likely to have declined.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate on an increase in net interest income (NII), supported by higher rates and loan growth. However, rising expenses and higher provisions were headwinds.Notably, PNC Financial has a decent earnings surprise history. It surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering an earnings surprise of 3.04%, on average.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and EPS SurpriseThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and EPS SurpriseThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc price-eps-surprise | The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc QuoteThe company’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings of $3.28 has moved 1.2% downward in the past week, reflecting the bearish sentiments of analysts. Further, the figure indicates a 4.09% decline from the year-ago reported number.Nonetheless, our estimate and the consensus estimate for revenues are pegged at $5.43 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 6.22%.Management expects the top line to be down approximately 3% sequentially.Now, let’s discuss factors that are likely to have impacted the company’s second-quarter performance.Loans and NII: Banks’ lending activities are likely to have declined in the quarter under review, as the challenging macroeconomic backdrop and high-interest rates affected consumer spending. Per Federal Reserve’s latest data, demand for commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans and consumer loans decreased in the first two months of the quarter. Given PNC’s high exposure to total commercial loans (nearly 69% as of Mar 31, 2023), the company is expected to have seen a decline in its lending book during the quarter.Story continuesAccordingly, the company expects average loans to remain flat during the quarter.Such a decline in lending activities is likely to affect NII in the quarter under review. Further, the Fed increased rates by 25 basis points in May and then kept the rates unchanged at 5-5.25% during the June FOMC meeting. An increase in funding costs is likely to have adversely impacted NII to some extent as interest rates continued to remain high.Management projects NII to decrease 2-4% sequentially. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII (on a fully taxable-equivalent or FTE basis) of $3.5 billion indicates a sequential decline of 3.4%. We project NII on FTE basis of $3.48 billion.Non-Interest Revenues: The high inflation is expected to have increased transactions and spending volumes, thereby supporting PNC’s card fees in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for card and cash management revenues of $664 million indicates a sequential increase of 1%.Since the onset of the second quarter, uncertainty in the economy due to recession fears have dampened the equity market performance. Thus, asset management revenues are anticipated to have been negatively impacted. The consensus estimate of $355 million for asset management and brokerage revenues indicates a marginal decline sequentially.Global deal making is likely to have continued shrinking in the second quarter from the prior-year period, with deal volume and total deal value numbers crashing. Geopolitical tensions, inflation, high-interest rates and fears of a global recession are likely to have acted as headwinds for merger and acquisition deals. Thus, the company’s capital markets and advisory revenues are likely to have been adversely impacted.Further, in the second quarter, mortgage rates continued to increase, with the rate on 30-year fixed mortgage reaching 6.81% in June, up from 4.6% reported in the prior-year quarter. The climb in mortgage rates, which kept home buyers on the sidelines, led to a smaller origination market, both purchase and refinancing compared with the prior-year quarter.Thus, these factors are expected to have hurt PNC Financial’s residential and commercial mortgage revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same of $165 million indicates a decrease of 9.6% sequentially.Overall, management expects fee income to remain stable to down 1% sequentially. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-interest income is pegged at $1.98 billion, suggesting a 1.9% decrease sequentially. Our estimate for the metric matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Expenses: Technology investments and general inflationary pressures are likely to have inflated costs, while wage inflation is anticipated to have escalated personnel expenses. Such a rise in expenses is likely to have limited bottom-line growth in the second quarter. Management expects non-interest expenses to be sequentially up 1-2%. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $3.36 billion, indicating a sequential increase of 1.2%. Nonetheless, its focus on cost-containment measures is likely to have reduced expenses to some extent, offering support.Asset Quality: PNC Financial is expected to have set aside substantial money for potential bad loans, given the global recession risk due to geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns and tighter financial conditions. Hence, higher reserve built during the quarter is expected to have weighed on PNC’s bottom-line growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing loans of $2.28 billion implies a 13.2% increase sequentially. Further, the consensus estimate for non-performing assets of $2.24 suggests a 9.3% increase.What the Zacks Model RevealsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for PNC Financial this time around. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.

223,91db4cd5-66a9-3ebf-a714-71542423350f,PNC,2023-07-12,Is PNC Financial Services (PNC) a Great Stock for Value Investors?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pnc-financial-services-pnc-great-154600766.html,1689090360,STORY,"['PNC', '^GSPC']","[Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, PNC Financial Services has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8.55, as you can see in the chart below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&amp;P 500 stands at about 20.67. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, PNC Financial Services’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint (which is 12.35) over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it can be a solid entry point.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Finance sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 14.79. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe should also point out that PNC Financial Services has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 9.22, which is higher than the current level. So, it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, PNC Financial Services has a P/S ratio of about 1.91. This is a bit lower than the S&amp;P 500 average, which comes in at 3.83 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, PNC Financial Services currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘B’, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes PNC Financial Services a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for PNC Financial Services is just 1.14, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1.33. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, PNC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though PNC Financial Services might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of F. This gives PNC a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here &gt;&gt;)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been dismal at best. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower, while the full year estimate has seen one up and eight down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 2.4% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased by 2.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and ConsensusThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and ConsensusThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc price-consensus-chart | The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LinePNC Financial Services is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 14% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

BLK is slated to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 14 before the opening bell. While its revenues are expected to have declined in the quarter, earnings are likely to have witnessed year-over-year growth.In first-quarter 2023, BLK’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from a decline in expenses. However, lower revenues and assets under management (AUM) balance were the major headwinds.BlackRock has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering a surprise of 7.8%, on average.BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBlackRock, Inc. price-eps-surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteThe company’s business activities and prospects in the to-be-reported quarter have not encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BlackRock’s second-quarter earnings of $8.43 has been revised 1.1% lower over the past 30 days. Nevertheless, the figure indicates a rise of 14.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for second-quarter earnings is $8.05.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.47 billion, which suggests a decline of 1.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for sales is $4.43 billion.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts for the to-be-reported quarter, let’s discuss the factors that are likely to have impacted the company’s quarterly performance.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q2BlackRock has been a dominant player in the exchange traded fund (“ETF”) market, given its continued investments in the U.S. iShare core ETFs. As investors have kept increasing allocations toward ETFs instead of alternative investments to reduce management costs, the company’s iShares inflows have been strong over the past several quarters, with the trend expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.The overall market performance was decent in the quarter. Thus, driven by expected inflows, BLK’s AUM balance is likely to have increased. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM is pegged at $9.12 trillion, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 7.5%. Our estimate for total AUM for the second quarter is $8.69 trillion, indicating a rise of 2.4%.Because of the rise in AUM, the related fee is expected to have been positively impacted. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s investment advisory performance fees is pegged at $125.9 million, indicating an increase of 18.8% from the previous-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for performance fees is $119.6 million, suggesting a rise of 12.8%.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for investment advisory, administration fees and securities-lending revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $3.64 billion, indicating a 1.4% year-over-year decline. Our estimate for the same is $3.59 billion, implying a decline of 2.6%.The consensus estimate for distribution fees of $335.3 million indicates a decline of 7.1% from the previous year. We also project the metric to be $335.3 million.The consensus estimate for technology services revenues is pegged at $354.5 million, implying a 6.8% year-over-year rise. We project the metric to increase 4.5% to $346.9 million.BlackRock’s expenses have been elevated over the past few years. Given that the company has been continuing its restructuring initiatives to modify the size and shape of its workforce and improve operating efficiency, overall costs are expected to have increased in the second quarter. Our estimate for total expenses is $3 billion, implying a year-over-year rise of 5%.Story continuesKey Development During the QuarterIn June, BLK signed an agreement to acquire London-based Kreos Capital, a private debt provider. While the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023.The deal will have no material impact on BlackRock's earnings.Kreos Capital is a well-known debt provider that invests in technology and health sectors across Israel and European high-growth companies.The acquisition is expected to further bolster BlackRock's position as the global credit asset manager. It is also expected to further expedite BLK's goal to provide its clients with a wide range of private market investment products and services.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of BlackRock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for BlackRock is -0.06%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks Worth a LookA couple of finance stocks, which you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases, per our model, are Wells Fargo WFC and PNC Financial PNC.The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo is +0.16% and it carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 18. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.1%.Revenues are expected to be $5.43 billion, up 6.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.75% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc?For The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.41%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc would post earnings of $3.60 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.98, delivering a surprise of +10.56%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, State Street Corporation (STT), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.08 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +7.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.12 billion, up 5.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for State Street Corporation has been revised 1.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.25%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that State Street Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

F.L.Putnam Chief Market Strategist Ellen Hazen joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss her stock winners and losers, as well as the health of the consumer.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Well, markets do seem to be off to a good start this summer. But with recession talk looming, investors are looking for the best ways to protect their investments. Our next guest joins us with some stock picks to help spruce up your portfolio. Ellen Hazen is with us-- chief market strategist and portfolio manager at FL Putnam Investment Management. Ellen, it's good to see you as always. And so we are coming off of sort of an unexpectedly strong start for the year here. As we take a breath going into the second half of the year, how are you sort of thinking about what the setup looks like?ELLEN HAZEN: So we're looking for estimates to be probably flat for the rest of 2023 where they are right now. Six, nine months ago we were looking at estimates that we thought were far too high for 2023. And right now, consensus has the full year at about down 2%, and we think that's probably about right.The economy is continuing to slow. But what you want to own in a decelerating economy are stocks that are pretty inexpensive, that have a cushion beneath them so that if they disappoint the valuations are not too demanding. And what we want to be doing is cutting back on those companies that have really high multiples.BRAD SMITH: What are the most cushiony, inexpensive stocks right now Helen-- Ellen?ELLEN HAZEN: So one example is Chubb. We've been buying Chubb recently. That's an insurance company. You think, wow, insurance, that's pretty boring. But it's trading at under 10 times earnings. They're still growing earnings at 10% to 12%, and it's trading at a 10-year low in terms of forward PE multiple.So that's a stock that I think you can add to. You could buy it today. And is it going to be the next Tesla? No, it's not going to be the next Tesla. But it's very Steady Eddie, it has a nice dividend yield, and it can provide a cushion in an environment where we see decelerating economic fundamentals, decelerating GDP. And therefore, I don't know how much earnings estimates are going to increase from here.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: You know, one stock maybe you don't think is so cushiony-- and we're showing here some of your recent portfolio activity. You exited-- exited Target. That one really caught my eye, Ellen, because here we are. Amazon Prime Days, right? We're going into the back-to-school season, et cetera. Why are you getting out of Target here?ELLEN HAZEN: Target was a great company and a great stock for a long time. And I think it's still a great company, but I don't know if it's going to be a good stock from here on in. If you look at the overall economic backdrop and diving into specific sectors as well, what you see is that services are doing really well across the board and goods are really struggling.You see that, for example, in the airline numbers that you quoted just a few minutes ago. We've seen the airline stocks do really well year to date. Airlines have pricing power. That's a service. People are going on revenge travel. You see it in the PMIs. If you look at the services PMI, it's still well above 50, and so that's showing an expanding economy as people are diverting their money towards services.But if you look at manufacturing PMI, that continues to struggle. And similarly, a lot of retailers that are dependent on goods-- selling goods, like Target but others as well, we think they're going to continue to struggle as the consumer is spending that saved up COVID savings-- that excess household balance sheet, they're spending that on services. And so even though Target's a pretty inexpensive stock and it is a great company-- I want to own it again at the right price-- I think as we look at the next three, six, nine months, it's harder to see what the catalyst is going to be for those goods part of the economy to reaccelerate.BRAD SMITH: If the consumer truly is as resilient as some of the guests we've spoken to are anticipating executives to talk about this earnings season, which of those companies would that show up for in their own reports, their own financial statements?ELLEN HAZEN: Well, one of the first things that I look at to gauge the health of the consumer is the credit card companies and whether or not we are seeing deterioration in delinquencies and defaults. And we're really not seeing it. We are a little bit at the lowest income quintile of households, and so we are seeing a little bit of credit stress there. But we're not seeing it in the main line credit card numbers.And so that's really where you're going to see the stresses first because people are going to fall behind on their credit card payments. And so we're not seeing it yet. But having said that, we have had very, very low delinquencies for years now, so it's probably just a matter of time until that begins to deteriorate.]"

If you want to skip our analysis of the stock market and want to jump to the top five stocks in our list, then take a look at 5 Best Breakout Stocks to Buy Now. The mini week of trading after the July Fourth holiday came with a series of surprises for investors. These were in the form of multiple data releases, all of which covered the state of the labor market. This market is one of the hottest (literally and figuratively) markets right now, since not only is it not refusing to slow down (much to the delight of politicians) but also because the Federal Reserve is watching it like a hawk. Growth in the labor market, especially when it is tight, results in an increase in wages that eventually contribute to inflation. Given that inflation is one of the biggest problems facing the American economy right now, the Federal Reserve is publicly committed to bringing it down through interest rate hikes.The slew of data releases in the first week of July revealed that the private sector added more than twice the number of jobs that economists had predicted. At the same time, unemployment claims for the final week of June also ticked up and the unemployment rate did not fall. Additionally, both the number of job openings and the opening rate declined in May as well, indicating on a whole that perhaps the economy is finally ready to slow down after taking a brutal beating in the form of ten interest rate hikes.Despite high rates and the constant worries of a recession, the stock market has performed remarkably well this year. The star of the show is the NASDAQ 100 index - up by 39.4% during the first half of this year to mark its strongest performance in decades. The index's fortune was boosted by big technology firms and mega cap stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) which have profited from the mania surrounding artificial intelligence. If you're interested in some hot NASDAQ stocks, be sure to check out 15 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Today.Story continuesHowever, the past is past and it's time to look at the future. After all, even as investors took a well earned break after H1, the reality still remains that inflation is high and more potential interest rate hikes might be looming on the horizon. And the latest employment data that we've talked about above is already making its mark on the market. After trading closed on the day the private payrolls data was released, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by a percent and two year Treasury yields jumped to 5.12% - at levels that it had stood in 2007. Investors' fear about more interest rate hikes was mirrored in the Cboe Volatility Index which closed the day to mark an 8.9% jump - which seems paltry considering the fact that it had jumped by a stunning 14.7%, mirroring growth levels that it had reached when bank shares fell earlier this year after the dramatic failure of several high profile banks.All eyes therefore shifted on the payrolls report for June that was due Friday. The private payrolls report set the scene for the upcoming release that will set the tone for the Federal Reserve's next meeting later this month. The central bank will decide whether to increase or keep rates the same, and optimistic investors have been penciling in just one rate hike for July. Officials at the central bank have currently decided to act cautiously, as ten interest rate hikes take their time to work through the economy. However, fears persisted that an unrelenting jobs market might force them to return to the brutal hawkishness displayed in 2023 when stunning 75 basis point hikes were delivered at a time when inflation had crossed 9%.So were investors expecting from the payrolls report that investors are waiting for with bated breaths? Well, Dow Jones consensus estimates believed that the number of jobs will grow by 240,000. The Labor Department's data for May showed that the economy had added 339,000 jobs (revised later to 309,000), and had the estimate held, then the labor market will have slowed down only annually. The May report had seen jobs drop by 51,000, and a reading of 240,000 for June would have implied an annual drop greater than a hundred thousand. Safe to say, the economic situation right now is quite different from a year back, but the key investor irritant is a resistant market that just invites the Federal Reserve to pump up the rates.The data itself was a pleasant surprise that turned around the narrative of the labor market refusing to budge on its head. It revealed that the U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs which ended up significantly undershooting market estimates and falling quite low over the data for May. As a result, major stock indexes including the NASDAQ 100, NASDAQ Composite, the S&amp;P500, and the NYSE Composite all jumped - with the U.S. dollar also tumbling in the currency market.So what to do in a world where markets go one way one day and another the next? Well, perhaps a recent analysis from Morgan Stanley might help, where the investment bank takes a rather gloomy tone:In the current market, we see a few opportunities. In fixed income, consider adding duration by investing in longer-maturity bonds. In equities, we believe that U.S. stock returns are apt to be below average. Investors should diversify using active managers or equal-weighted indices. We continue to see Japanese and emerging-markets stocks, as well as commodities, as good hedges for a peaking U.S. dollar.The bottom line: Investors need to think about the big picture. Don’t try to predict market moves. Instead, work with your Financial Advisor to stay close to your strategic asset allocations, rebalancing as needed.With this backdrop, let's take a look at some stocks that are performing well as part of coverage of the top breakout stocks to buy.

Chloe slipped from his grasp and fell about 150 feet to her death on the pier below.Chloe's parents Alan Wiegand and Kimberly Schultz-Wiegand, both from Indiana, sued Royal Caribbean, saying it violated industry standards by not installing safety devices to prevent falls from windows.In a 21-page decision, the three-judge appeals court said jurors could find that Royal Caribbean knew the risk of children falling through open windows, noting its use of protective railings and warnings to passengers not to climb over them.It also said jurors should decide whether Royal Caribbean could have foreseen an adult like Anello holding Chloe near the window, which might not excuse its alleged negligence.The court returned the case to U.S. District Judge Donald Graham in Miami. He had dismissed it in July 2021, saying Anello's conduct was the unforeseeable, proximate cause of Chloe's death, and the open window was an obvious danger.Royal Caribbean and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Jacqueline Garcell, a lawyer for the parents, faulted Royal Caribbean for refusing to install devices that many large hotel chains also use to prevent falls.""We look forward to continuing our fight for justice for Chloe Wiegand and to make cruise ships safer,"" she said.Story continuesAnello, of Valparaiso, Indiana, was sentenced in February 2021 to three years probation after pleading guilty to negligent homicide in Chloe's death, according to Puerto Rico's Department of Justice.The case is Wiegand et al v Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-12506.(This story has been refiled to correct the case number in the citation in paragraph 12)(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis)]"

He had dismissed it in July 2021, saying Anello's conduct was the unforeseeable, proximate cause of Chloe's death, and the open window was an obvious danger.Royal Caribbean and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Jacqueline Garcell, a lawyer for the parents, faulted Royal Caribbean for refusing to install devices that many large hotel chains also use to prevent falls.""We look forward to continuing our fight for justice for Chloe Wiegand and to make cruise ships safer,"" she said.Anello, of Valparaiso, Indiana, was sentenced in February 2021 to three years probation after pleading guilty to negligent homicide in Chloe's death, according to Puerto Rico's Department of Justice.The case is Wiegand et al v Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-12506.

These tools, from waste-to-energy systems, food waste applications and an expanded network of green hubs are a result of the cruise company's relentless drive to deliver the best vacation experiences responsibly.Royal Caribbean International's Icon of the Seas (PRNewsfoto/Royal Caribbean Group)Debuting this year, on two of Royal Caribbean Group's newest ships, will be the cruise industry's first systems to turn solid waste directly into energy onboard.""I am proud of Royal Caribbean Group's drive to SEA the Future and be better tomorrow than we are today,"" said Jason Liberty, president and CEO, Royal Caribbean Group. ""Pioneering the first waste to energy system on a cruise ship builds on our commitment to remove waste from local landfills and deliver great vacation experiences, responsibly.""Solid Waste to Energy at SeaThe systems, Microwave-Assisted Pyrolysis (MAP) and Micro Auto Gasification (MAG), debuting respectively on Royal Caribbean International's Icon of the Seas and Silversea Cruises' Silver Nova, will take waste on board and convert it into synthesis gas (syngas) that the ship can directly use as energy. Much like land-based waste-to-energy facilities, the result is repurposing waste in an efficient and sustainable way. An additional bioproduct of the system, biochar, can also be used as a soil nutrient.Reducing Food WasteRoyal Caribbean Group is also looking at waste management from start to finish. Including its plans to reduce food waste across the fleet by 50% by 2025. To do so, the cruise company is implementing initiatives across its brands including:Developing a proprietary platform to monitor food supply and accurately estimate how much food should be produced, prepped and ordered on a given day.Using artificial intelligence (AI) to adjust food production in real time.Introducing a dedicated onboard food waste role to monitor and train crew members.Tracking guest demand for specific menu items and adjusting menu preparation and ordering accordingly.Introducing a food waste awareness campaign in the crew dining areas fleet wide.Story continuesTo date, Royal Caribbean Group has achieved a 24% reduction in food waste by focusing on the front end of the food system, which prevents and addresses many of the main causes of food waste, including inventory management and over-preparing.Expanding Green HubsSince the company's first environmental initiative, Save the Waves, aimed at ensuring no solid waste goes overboard, Royal Caribbean Group has worked diligently to increase accountability and strengthen responsible waste management practices. To do so, it developed Green Hubs, a capacity-building program to identify waste vendors in strategic destinations that has helped divert 92% of its waste from landfills. Since its start in 2014, the program has grown to 33 ports worldwide.Now joining the Green Hub program is the Galapagos Islands, where Silversea became the first operator to gain certification in environmental management by diverting all waste from landfill. Initiatives like this allow Royal Caribbean Group to continue to safeguard the delicate ecosystem of the Galapagos for future generations.Championing the EnvironmentWith a sustainability journey that began over 30 years ago, Royal Caribbean Group has remained steadfast in its commitment to innovate, and advance, the solutions necessary for a better future. Building on a robust portfolio of technologies that improve energy efficiency, water treatment and waste management, incorporating waste-to-energy systems is an extension of the company's commitment to reach beyond the expected and SEA the Future to sustain the planet, energize the communities in which it operates and accelerate innovation.To learn more about how Royal Caribbean Group connects people to the world's most beautiful destinations while respecting and protecting ocean communities and ecosystems visit www.royalcaribbeangroup.com/SEAtheFuture.About Royal Caribbean GroupRoyal Caribbean Group (NYSE: RCL) is one of the leading cruise companies in the world with a global fleet of 64 ships traveling to approximately 1,000 destinations around the world.

236,f3922189-3bed-36ac-a94e-bfab26735da3,RF,2023-07-12,11 Best Local Bank Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-local-bank-stocks-160002330.html,1689091202,STORY,"['BAC', 'USB', 'PACW', 'MTB', 'HBAN', 'EWBC', 'RF', 'KEY']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 best local bank stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To skip our detailed analysis of the banking industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Local Bank Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The 2023 Banking CrisisIn March 2023, the US banking industry witnessed a severe crisis with the failure of three small-to-mid-sized banks. These included Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Silvergate Bank, and Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY). The collapse of these three banks sent the US public into a panic. The SVB collapse, in particular, led to a significant uproar considering the fact that the bank's clients included major technology companies and wealthy individuals who had made large deposits with the bank. Rising interest rates had led to these three banks suffering large unrealized losses on US Treasury bond holdings, and the resulting failures of these institutions set in motion the 2023 banking crisis.The banking industry has managed to settle down somewhat since March, especially since the Federal Reserve made promises to honor the deposits of the three failing banks. Here's a comment from the Federal Reserve's Chair, Jerome Powell, on the situation, made this March:""You have seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when there's a threat of serious harm to the economy or to the financial system, and we're prepared to use those tools. I think depositors should assume that their deposits are safe.""Despite the above statement, it is to be noted that Chairman Powell sidestepped the question of whether the Federal Reserve is prepared to bail out the depositors of banks with less than $1 billion in assets in the event that such a bank fails. Thus while the Fed seems to have extended a guarantee for the deposits of larger banks, the situation seems unclear when it comes to smaller banks and their depositors, throwing the clientele of such banks and the institutions into a frenzy over what to expect from the Fed in the event that the banking crisis worsens.Story continuesBig Banks May Be In The Clear, But What About Small Banks?Additionally, according to CNBC, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also commented this March that not all banks in the US, regardless of their size, would be fully insured. So while US bank regulators managed to fully insure the deposits of SVB and Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY), this treatment has not been promised to all other US banks in the event of a collapse, leaving smaller banks and their depositors in a state of paranoia. This paranoia also led to smaller US banks facing increased amounts of withdrawals while mega-banks began gaining in deposits. According to a Wall Street Journal article from this March, after the SVB collapse, the 25 largest banks in the US gained about $120 billion in deposits, as shown by Federal Reserve data. At the same time, smaller US banks suffered from losses amounting to $108 billion over the same period.In his interview on CNBC this March, Nelson Peltz, the founder of Trian Fund Management, commented on this situation:""All the money as we know is leaving the small community banks and the regional banks and going to the three or four largest banks in America, and that's a very dangerous situation, and it's got to be resolved. What I would do is this: I would put together a plan that applies only to the US banks, and that the Fed gets an insurance premium for any money you leave in a US-accredited bank over $250,000. So you're creating income for the Fed, and in exchange for that they insure the coverage.""The plan put forth by Peltz envisions a guarantee from the Fed for all bank deposits regardless of the bank's size while also charging the bank's customers for that insurance. However, no such policy has been adopted by the Fed at present, leaving local US banks in a state of uncertainty while large banks like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) continue to gain. As of July 9, for instance, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is up by 6.82% year-to-date, while shares of smaller banks like Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) are down by 22.77% year-to-date.While the situation seems dire, it should be noted that the outflow of deposits from small banks cooled down since the initial frenzy right after the collapse of SVB and the other two banks, as CNBC reported near the end of March. This means that smaller US banks may have more hope than initially expected. As such, the investing public is looking for the best regional bank stocks to buy now or the best small bank stocks to invest in as the banking crisis cools down. As such, we have compiled a list of these stocks below.11 Best Local Bank Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Mikel Parera on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe selected local American bank stocks that were the most popular among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey during the first quarter of 2023 to compile our list below. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number.Best Local Bank Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds11. PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Brandon King at Truist Securities has a Hold rating on PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW)  shares as of June 29, alongside a $10 price target.PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) is a local US bank based in Los Angeles, California. It offers business banking and treasury management services.PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) was spotted in the 13F holdings of 22 hedge funds during the first quarter, with a total stake value of $139 million.Manole Capital Management mentioned PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“25 years ago, there were 13,000 financial institutions, but now there’s really only 4,000 banks left. Will we continue to see consolidation? With JP Morgan buying First Republic, the latest worry seems to PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW). In a recent security filing, it reported that it lost 9.5% of its total deposits, with most of it happening over two days. For PacWest and other regional banks, they are fighting a two-sided battle. On one side, investors are finally demanding higher yields and the media is highlighting the risk of keeping assets at struggling banks. On the other side, short sellers are eager to identify the next possible “weak (banking) link”.”10. East West Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23East West Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC) is a regional bank based in Pasadena, California. It is the bank holding company for East West Bank.Truist Securities analyst Jennifer Demba holds a Buy rating on East West Bancorp, Inc.

(NASDAQ:EWBC) at the end of the first quarter, making it the largest shareholder in the company.Aristotle Capital Management mentioned East West Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC) in its first-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We purchased East West Bancorp in the third quarter of 2017; however, our history with the business stretches back further having twice previously invested. Companies we consider to be high-quality like East West tend to remain high quality, and we have long admired the business for its uniqueness among the otherwise homogenous U.S. banking industry. Its dominant market share built over generations in Asian communities – and difficult-to-replicate experience due to culture, geography and business practices – create distinct competitive advantages in our view. During our most recent holding period, the bank achieved sustained loan growth, a catalyst we identified, through its continued leadership position as the financial “bridge” for customers doing business in the U.S. and China. Moreover, East West also realized market share gains in its headquarters state of California. With these catalysts nearing completion, we decided to exit our investment to fund the purchase of Oshkosh. As always, we will continue to study East West and, in the future, may once again find an opportunity to be investors.”Like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), East West Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC) is a bank stock worth keeping an eye on in the second half of 2023.9.

Importantly, MTB has neither the same kind of client concentration risk nor duration risk that impacted Silicon Valley Bank. Particularly with respect to duration risk, MTB was an outlier in its conservatism with respect to buying shorter-term securities in a very low rate environment. MTB does have exposure to commercial real estate, including office real estate. While we do expect some elevated credit losses in this portion of the loan portfolio, we note MTB has historically been an effective manager of risk, and we remain confident that management has behaved with appropriate caution.”Like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), M&amp;T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB) is a bank stock that is popular among elite hedge funds today.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Local Bank Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Suggested articles:Top 20 Most Profitable Banks in the World10 Best Small Cap Bank Stocks With Dividends10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure: None. 11 Best Local Bank Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

As the market enters the second half of 2023, the Federal Reserve's decisive approach to interest rate hikes is finally bringing about some clarity regarding an economic cooldown.Earlier this June, Fed officials made predictions indicating their intention to raise interest rates twice more within the year, assuming these adjustments would be made in quarter-point increments. However, that does not mean that the Fed must hurt the labor market to achieve policymakers’ goals. In fact, Fed Chair Powell has acknowledged that wages are not necessarily the primary factor driving current inflation. He has noted that wages and inflation often exhibit a correlated relationship, but determining which one is causing the other is challenging to determine.As the July 7 payrolls report approached, traders were preparing for a potentially impactful event. Surprisingly robust data released by the ADP Research Institute a day prior had convinced the market that job growth in the US was still ""too strong"" from the perspective of central bankers cautious about inflation. According to the report, US employers added 209,000 jobs in June, falling short of Wall Street expectations. This led to concerns that the Federal Reserve might implement tighter monetary policy. However, the outcome presented a more nuanced view of the labor market, indicating a moderate slowdown that aligns with the Fed's objectives, albeit at a slower pace than anticipated by some. Investors widely expect the Fed to raise interest rates at their July meeting, and the strength of the labor market could help to shape the outlook after that.Story continuesThese are all developments affecting the market in the short-term. If you are a long-term investor who is looking for forever stocks to buy as we do in our monthly newsletter, you hope that the stock market declines by at least 20% to buy your favorite stocks at a discount. At the end of September 2022, the market provided such an opportunity. We don't think we are going to get another opportunity in the near future and this may be relatively the best time to buy.As the market closed the first half of this year with a positive boost from a reassuring inflation report, the notion of acquiring the best ""forever stocks"" might appear overly cautious. With market sentiment strong and supported by seemingly justifiable factors, investors may lean towards riskier securities with higher potential returns. However, it's important to acknowledge that long-term stock investments hold their own value and significance. With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some potential forever stocks, out of which the top picks include the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), among others listed below.13 Best Forever Stocks to Buy NowOur Methodology""Our favorite holding period is forever."" When it comes to long-term investments, who better to imitate than Wall Street's legendary value investor, Warren Buffett. In order to compile our selection of the best forever stocks, we began by analyzing Buffett's stock portfolio and chose to highlight the stock holdings that have remained within his portfolio for at least 5 years. Next, we assessed the number of hedge fund investors associated with each stock based on Insider Monkey’s survey of 943 funds during the first quarter of this year. Using this information, the stocks were ranked.To be clear the following 13 stocks are the best forever stocks to buy according to billionaire investor and secret hedge fund manager Warren Buffett. We have our own list of favorite forever stocks that we share in our premium newsletter. You should do your own research and decide any of the following stocks fit your definition of forever stocks:13. DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) is a prominent healthcare company specializing in kidney care services. With a significant presence, it ranks among the largest providers of dialysis services in the United States. The company's primary focus lies in treating individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney failure.Lisa Bedell Clive at Bernstein issued an update on May 15, raising the price target on DaVita Inc. (NYSE: DVA) from $88 to $100. This adjustment came in response to the company's improved 2023 guidance, which was announced on May 9.After digging through 943 hedge funds for their March quarter of 2023 investments, Insider Monkey discovered that 32 had bought DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)’s shares. The firm’s second largest investor after Warren Buffett is Jeffrey Gates’ Gates Capital Management, owning one million shares that are worth $84 million.Here is what Moon Capital Management said about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) ranks among the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a decent stock for long-term investments.12. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), commonly known as Kraft Heinz, is an American multinational food company formed by the merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz Company co-headquartered in Chicago and Pittsburgh. The company is involved in making and selling a wide variety of products, including cheese, meals, meats, dairy products, spices, coffee, and others.The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) released its Q1 financial results on May 3, revealing a non-GAAP EPS of $0.68 and revenue of $6.49 billion. These figures exceeded Wall Street estimates by $0.08 and $100 million, respectively. Additionally, the company anticipates a 4% to 6% growth in organic net sales for 2023, as compared to the previous year.Out of the 943 hedge funds included in Insider Monkey's Q1 2023 database, 34 of them held a stake in The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC). First Eagle Investment Management, managed by Jean-Marie Eveillard, emerged as the largest hedge fund investor, with a stake worth $256 million, equivalent to 6.6 million shares. However, the largest overall investor in Kraft Heinz is Warren Buffett, with a massive investment of $12 billion.11. VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Verisign Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) is an American company based in Reston, Virginia, United States, that operates a diverse array of network infrastructure that allows firms to maintain their servers, access domain names, and run security applications. The company ended the first quarter of 2023 with 174.8 million domains in the .com/.net base, which was 1 million more than it ended in the same quarter a year ago.By the end of this year’s first quarter, 37 of the 943 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey’s database had held a stake in the company. Following Warren Buffett, Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)'s largest shareholder, which owns 3.1 million shares that are worth $672 million.10. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), or simply Kroger, is an American retail company that operates supermarkets and multi-department stores throughout the United States. With more than 2,700 supermarkets and multi-department stores spread across 35 states in the United States, The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) ranks as one of the largest food retailers in the world.Earlier this June, UBS lowered the price target on The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) to $48 from $51 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. According to the analysts', sentiment on Kroger remains mixed despite a ""strong"" performance in Q1 as its FY23 outlook remains uncertain. The firm also states that the tone will likely remain mixed until the market gains more confidence in Kroger's intermediate-term outlook and that this will likely leave the stock range-bound for ""the foreseeable future.""Insider Monkey took a look at 943 hedge funds for their first quarter of 2023 investments and found out that 43 had owned The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)’s shares. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns a $2.5 billion stake in the company.Oakmark Funds, advised by Harris Associates, made the following comment about The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption.”9. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO), commonly known as Moody's, is an American business and financial services company. It serves as the parent company for Moody's Investors Service (MIS), an American credit rating agency, and Moody's Analytics (MA), a provider of financial analysis software and services based in the United States.Jeffrey Silber, an analyst at BMO Capital, restated an Outperform rating for Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) stock on May 17, while increasing the target price from $355 to $360. Silber holds the belief that Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) has the potential for a substantial upside of over 16%, considering the closing stock price as of May 18.By the end of Q1 2023, 51 of the 943 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey had bought a stake in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO). A major hedge fund investor is Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management with a $3.17 billion stake.8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Established in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is a prominent American multinational corporation renowned for its production of the iconic Coca-Cola beverage. In addition to its flagship product, the company is involved in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse array of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even some alcoholic beverages within the beverage industry. As one of the largest beverage corporations globally, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) holds a significant position among the long-term investments of renowned value investor Warren Buffett. Buffett, who has maintained a stake in the company since 2010, has famously expressed his unwavering commitment to retain his shares in the company.On June 6, HSBC analyst Carlos Laboy lowered the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $74 from $77 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst views Coca-Cola as a much better defensive stock in inflationary times than in the past. However, his near term concern for beverage giant remains the ongoing tax litigation, which it says could cost the company up to 14 billion in payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”7. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73General Motors, formally the General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), is an American multinational automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, United States.During the initial quarter of 2023, the company experienced an impressive 11.1% growth in revenue compared to the previous year, reaching nearly $40 billion. Additionally, the automotive operating cash flow for the quarter rose to $2.3 billion, showcasing a significant increase from $1.6 billion in the same period of the previous year.Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) from an Equal Weight rating to an Overweight rating on May 1. Additionally, the analyst increased the price target on the stock from $35 to $38. Recognizing General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) as one of the leading companies in the auto sector, Jones included it in his list of the ""top 5"" automotive companies.According to Insider Monkey’s Q1 2023 database, 73 hedge funds disclosed long positions in General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), worth roughly $4 billion. Of these, investment firm Harris Associates holds a significant position as a shareholder.6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American multinational consumer goods corporation headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. The company provides branded consumer packaged goods worldwide, operating through Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segments.On April 11, the company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.9407 per share, marking a 3% increase. With this raise, the company extended its impressive streak of dividend growth to 67 years, solidifying its position as not only one of the top dividend aristocrat stocks on our list, but also one of the best forever stock.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), compared to 74 funds in the preceding quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.94 million shares valued at $735.2 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”Much like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a top 'forever' stock finding favor with hedge funds.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Now.

Large cap-centric indexes like the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite rallied 15.9% and 31.7%, respectively. The small cap -centric Russell 2000 and the mid cap-centric S&amp;P 400 advanced more than 5% and 7%, respectively.

Marriott International (MAR), which belongs to the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This hotel company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 9.44%.For the most recent quarter, Marriott was expected to post earnings of $1.86 per share, but it reported $2.09 per share instead, representing a surprise of 12.37%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.84 per share, while it actually produced $1.96 per share, a surprise of 6.52%.For Marriott, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Marriott currently has an Earnings ESP of +17.20%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

You can skip our detailed analysis of franchises and the current franchise industry prospects, and see the top 5 entries in this list by clicking the 5 Most Profitable Franchises To Buy in 2023.When a business wants to increase its market share or geographical reach at a low cost, it may franchise its product and brand name. A franchise is a joint venture between a franchisor and a franchisee, with the franchisor being the original business that sells the right to use its name and idea, while the franchisee buys this right to sell the franchisor's goods or services under an existing business model and trademark. This practice is common in a variety of segments across the global economy and encompasses some of the most well-known companies in the world.The franchise industry is skyrocketing and achieving incredible growth in terms of business, with the economic output of franchise establishments in the United States reaching about $790 billion in 2021. According to the International Franchise Association's (IFA) 2023 Economic Report, the overall number of franchise establishments is expected to increase by almost 15,000 units, or 1.9%, to 805,000 units which will in turn, add approximately 254,000 jobs in 2023. Growing at 3.0%, total franchise employment is forecasted to reach 8.7 million. Additionally, the report states that franchises’ GDP is anticipated to grow at a pace of 4.2% to $521.3 billion. Given these factors, it is anticipated that the growth in employment will be driven mostly by business services, personal services, and quick-service restaurants. In 2023, business services are projected to contribute a growth rate of 5.2% to the overall labor force, while personal services are expected to add 4.7%. As a consequence, some franchises tend to push ahead of their competitors as they exhibit growth that would place them as the fastest-growing franchises in the world.Story continuesOn the other hand, qualified labor availability and workforce costs continue to pose the most significant challenge for nearly all franchised businesses. The latest labor survey conducted by IFA/FRANdata in 2023 reveals that 81% of franchised brands faced growth limitations attributed to labor-related issues, which is consistent with the challenges observed in 2022.The franchise industry is dominated by fast food or quick-service restaurants. According to Polaris Market Research, the booming quick service restaurant (QSR) industry was valued at $173.72 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.9% during the forecast period. While 2022 was a challenging year for QSRs due to supply constraints, labor shortages, and high inflation rates, personal services and QSRs are expected to lead the growth in franchised units in 2023, expanding by 2.5% year-over-year despite a decline in consumer spending, due to the strong demand for food deliveries. Major players in the QSR industry, include big household names such as McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Burger King Worldwide Inc (NYSE:BKW), and The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN).While franchises seem to be a lucrative source of income, they come at a high price as there usually an initial investment that is required in order to open the business. In order to become a franchise owner, each business establishes its own set of conditions, which typically include an initial franchise fee, a minimum net worth requirement, and a minimum liquid assets requirement. Moreover, each company imposes a basic and advertising royalty fee, the specific amounts of which may differ between companies. As an example, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD),  franchisee applicants must have a minimum of $500,000 available in liquid assets and pay a $45,000 franchise fee. Those looking to launch a new McDonald's franchise can expect to shell out between $1,314,500 and $2,306,500. Similarly, prospective Ace Hardware franchise owners must have roughly $250,000 in liquid capital, with a minimum net worth of at least $400,000. Other than the initial investment, there are annual licensing fee, and royalty that are paid by the franchisee over the tenure of the business. Most franchise businesses typically provide easily accessible online applications for people interested in applying for a franchise. Additionally, these businesses generally offer a rough estimation of the initial investment necessary to establish and operate the franchise.There are many advantages, and drawbacks, that come with investing in a franchise. The most profitable franchises include a ready-made business formula to follow since a franchise usually comes with market-tested products and services, and in many cases established brand recognition. Consumers prefer a proven quality product over new brands. In that same vein, it is expected that the same quality products are offered by brands all over the world irrespective of the region. On the other hand, franchises, by definition, have ongoing fees that must be paid to the franchisor in the form of a percentage of sales or revenue. This percentage can range between 4.6% and 12.5%, depending on the industry. Additionally, franchisees may have limited autonomy in running their business, as they must adhere to the franchisor's established system and standards.In the United States, there is a vast array of businesses that provide franchising opportunities to aspiring entrepreneurs and investors. Our list of the 20 Most Profitable Franchises in the World highlights some of the notable contenders, such as RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:RMAX), Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and various subsidiaries of Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM).10 Most Profitable Franchises To Buy in 2022Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyIn order to compile the list for the most 10 profitable franchises to buy in 2023, we have taken the rankings from the report published by Franchise Direct which used Franchise Disclosure Documents and press releases to rank the companies based on parameters like sales revenue, number of locations, location growth, age, franchising tenure, and corporate citizenship.

251,1efa1765-8486-3cc4-af98-e2415e06c17c,SNA,2023-07-12,Why Snap-On (SNA) is a Great Dividend Stock Right Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-snap-sna-great-dividend-154512540.html,1689090312,STORY,['SNA'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Snap-On in FocusSnap-On (SNA) is headquartered in Kenosha, and is in the Consumer Discretionary sector. The stock has seen a price change of 24.9% since the start of the year. The tool and diagnostic equipment maker is paying out a dividend of $1.62 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.27% compared to the Tools - Handheld industry's yield of 0.86% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.66%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $6.48 is up 10.2% from last year. In the past five-year period, Snap-On has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 14.52%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Snap-On's current payout ratio is 37%, meaning it paid out 37% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.SNA is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $17.82 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 5.95%.Story continuesBottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that SNA is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That compares with a 14.8% gain for the benchmark S&amp;P 500.Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon.com and Tesla combined account for 43.8% weight in the index, according to Refinitiv data as of Monday's close. As part of the rebalance that will come down to 38.5%.""There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.The adjustment will be based on shares outstanding as of July 3, with changes set to be announced on July 14 and taking effect before the market opens on July 24.WHAT IS A SPECIAL REBALANCING?A special rebalancing, which is part of Nasdaq 100's methodology to maintain compliance with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule on fund diversification, has taken place twice before, in 2011 and 1998, said Cameron Lilja, global head of index product and operations at Nasdaq.The special rebalancing may be conducted at any time if the aggregate weight of companies, each having more than 4.5% weight in the index, tops 48%, according to Nasdaq. During the rebalancing, it is capped at 40%.Microsoft has the largest weight at 12.91%, followed by Apple at 12.47%, Nvidia 7.04%, Amazon 6.89% and Tesla 4.50%, according to Refinitiv data.A recent rally in Tesla's shares pushed the aggregate weight above 48%, triggering the rebalance, Wells Fargo strategists said in a client note.COULD THE S&amp;P 500 FOLLOW SUIT?Story continuesRebalancing of weights in the S&amp;P 500 takes place when the aggregate of companies, with each having weight greater than 4.8%, exceeds 50% of the total index, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.Apple and Microsoft are the only two firms with weight over 4.5% in the S&amp;P 500. The top five firms, with the most influence in the S&amp;P 500 that also include Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla, make up for 22.2% of the index's total market value.An S&amp;P spokesperson said that they ""do not typically comment on other index providers' actions and potential changes to our indices"".WHICH STOCKS COULD SEE A BUMP IN WEIGHT?Wells Fargo index strategists estimate Starbucks, Mondelez, Booking Holdings, Gilead Sciences , Intuitive Surgical, Analog Devices and Automatic Data Processing will see their weight increase in the Nasdaq 100 index.Meanwhile Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Meta Platforms and Alphabet's influence in the index could reduce, according to the strategists.""The smaller companies will end up representing a greater percentage of the entire index,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.""It will require portfolio managers to add to their positions in these companies, which will boost their share prices.""PUTTING BRAKES ON MEGACAP RALLYApple, which touched $3 trillion in market capitalization late last month, fell 1% on Monday following the news. Other megacap stocks including Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon fell between 0.7% and 2.5%.Changes to the index will force investment funds that track it to adjust their portfolios and sell shares of companies that have their weight in the index reduced.A host of funds that track the Nasdaq 100, including popular exchange traded fund, the $200 billion Invesco QQQ ETF, are expected to be impacted by the rebalancing.(Reporting by Sruthi Shankar, Medha Singh and Bansari Mayur Kamdar in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by David Randall in New York; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)]"

AngioDynamics’ management intends to use the net proceeds to eliminate its existing debt and support further strategic investments in growth and profitability.AngioDynamics’ management believes that this divestiture is likely to support its focus on the high-growth Med Tech platforms and better position the company to focus on driving growth in the NanoKnife, Mechanical Thrombectomy and Auryon businesses. This raises our optimism about the company.However, AngioDynamics’ net sales for its fiscal 2023 will be inclusive of the Dialysis Product Portfolio and BioSentry product and are expected to be in the range of $338 million to $339 million.On the third quarter of fiscal 2023 earnings call in March, AngioDynamics confirmed that the uptick in its Med Tech net sales was driven by robust Auryon and NanoKnife sales. The company also witnessed strong NanoKnife disposable sales and AlphaVac sales. We expect the momentum for the above-mentioned products to be robust in the fiscal fourth quarter as well on the back of continued strong demand.AngioDynamics, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAngioDynamics, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAngioDynamics, Inc. price-eps-surprise | AngioDynamics, Inc. QuoteStory continuesHowever, sustained lower sales of AngioVac are likely to have continued in the fiscal fourth quarter due to its nature. It is AngioDynamics’ most sensitive product and is impacted by hospital staffing challenges due to the complex nature of the procedure, requiring numerous support specialties, including perfusionists, and usually requiring an ICU bed. This is likely to have weighed on the company’s segmental performance.We estimate the fiscal fourth-quarter Med Tech revenues to be $26.9 million, suggesting an uptick of 19.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Med Device BusinessOn the fiscal third-quarter earnings call, AngioDynamics confirmed that the Med Device segment’s strong year-over-year growth was driven by strength in the company’s angiographic products, ports, dialysis and microwave. The growth in the fiscal third quarter was also positively impacted by a less challenging comp due to the headwinds faced due to a tight labor market and supply chain disruptions in the year-ago period.We expect the demand for the segment’s products to have continued in the fiscal fourth quarter, thereby driving the segmental revenues. However, continued higher inflationary pressures are likely to have dented the company’s segmental and overall revenues.We estimate the fiscal fourth-quarter Med Device revenues to be $63.6 million, suggesting a decline of 1.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Estimate PictureFor fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $90.7 million for total revenues calls for an uptick of 4.3% from the prior-year reported figure.The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 3 cents, implying a surge of 200% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates.

However, the company’s opioid-related litigation expenses are a potential threat.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have risen 10.6% year to date compared with the industry’s 12.6% growth. The S&amp;P 500 Index has risen 15.6% in the same time frame.McKesson is a healthcare services and information technology company with a market capitalization of $56.25 billion. Its earnings are anticipated to improve 10.8% over the next five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s bottom line beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same once, delivering an average surprise of 4.48%. Its earnings yield of 6.4% compares favorably with the industry’s 4.2%.What’s Backing MCK?McKesson continues to actively pursue deals, divestitures and acquisitions to drive growth. In April 2022, the company completed the divestiture of its retail and distribution businesses in the United Kingdom to Aurelius.During fiscal 2022, MCK completed the sale of its Austrian business to Quadrifolia and the remaining share of its German joint venture to Walgreens Boots Alliance.Earlier this year, the company completed the divestiture of all of its European businesses. These divestitures will allow McKesson to focus on its key growth market — the United States.In October 2022, MCK completed formation of a joint venture with HCA Healthcare to create a fully integrated oncology research organization. Per the deal, McKesson and HCA will integrate their respective research units — U.S. Oncology Research (USOR) and Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI).The newly created entity, with the combined capabilities of SCRI and USOR, is expected to boost clinical research and drug development, lead to better data and analytic capabilities, and pave the way for a wider portfolio of clinical trials.Story continuesMcKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market. It stands to benefit from an increased generic utilization and inflation in generics, courtesy of an aging population and several patent expirations in the next few years. The Distribution Solutions segment caters to a wide range of customers and businesses.During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, McKesson’s growth was led by strong performances across all segments, except the International segment, which was marred by unfavorable currency movement. The divestiture of the company’s European business also hurt its growth.Last month, MCK launched its curated private brand of over-the-counter (OTC) health and wellness products, Foster &amp; Thrive. The launch, expected to unify the company’s private brand portfolio, consolidates Health Mart and Sunmark branded OTC products. It is also expected to significantly strengthen McKesson’s Pharmacy &amp; Healthcare Solutions business.What’s Hurting the Stock?McKesson’s broad settlement of opioid-related claims of states and municipalities is likely to increase its short-term expenses. Per the settlement deal, the company had to pay up to approximately $7.2 billion to the Settling Governmental Entities.Estimates TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $294.48 billion, indicating a 6.4% increase from the previous year’s level.

(NASDAQ:CHRW) Delivered A Better ROE Than Its Industry",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/c-h-robinson-worldwide-inc-131006853.html,1689081006,STORY,['CHRW'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for C.H. Robinson Worldwide is:57% = US$785m ÷ US$1.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.57 in profit.Does C.H. Robinson Worldwide Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, C.H. Robinson Worldwide has a higher ROE than the average (15%) in the Logistics industry.roeThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . To know the 2 risks we have identified for C.H. Robinson Worldwide visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesC.H. Robinson Worldwide's Debt And Its 57% ROEC.H. Robinson Worldwide clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.36. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

Don't Ignore These 2 Auto-Tires-Trucks Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-130007074.html,1689080407,STORY,"['TSLA', 'CMI']","[Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Tesla (TSLA) earns a Zacks Rank #3 eight days from its next quarterly earnings release on July 19, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.85 a share.Tesla's Earnings ESP sits at 2.41%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.85 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.83.TSLA is part of a big group of Auto-Tires-Trucks stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Cummins (CMI) as well.Cummins, which is readying to report earnings on August 3, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $5.27 a share, and CMI is 23 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cummins is $5.16, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 2.16%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, TSLA and CMI could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Members have authorized a strike if negotiators cannot reach a deal, and A-list stars including Jennifer Lawrence and Meryl Streep have said they are ready to walk off the job.They would join about 11,500 members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA), who went on strike in early May. That walkout sent late-night television talk shows into endless reruns and disrupted most production for the autumn TV season and the filming of some big-budget movies.A strike by SAG-AFTRA would force more sets to shut down and pile pressure on studios to find a resolution.Late on Tuesday, SAG-AFTRA negotiators agreed to a studio request to call in a federal mediator. But the union said studio representatives had ""abused our trust"" with leaks to the media and it would not budge from the Wednesday night deadline.Hollywood has not faced a double strike since 1960, when members of the WGA and the Screen Actors Guild called work stoppages in a fight over residuals from films sold to TV networks.Today, the unions are battling Netflix, Walt Disney and other companies over base pay and residuals from streaming services and other issues including the use of generative AI. Actors want assurances that their digital images will not be used without their permission.Negotiations were taking place at a difficult time for media companies that have spent billions of dollars on programming to try to attract new streaming customers.Disney, Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal and Paramount Global each lost hundreds of millions of dollars from streaming in the most recent quarter. At the same time, the rise of online video has eroded television ad revenue as traditional TV audiences shrink.The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which negotiates on behalf of the studios, has declined to comment about its talks with SAG-AFTRA.With the writers, the AMPTP said it had offered ""generous"" pay increases but could not agree to all of the writers' demands. The studios and the WGA have not held talks since the writers' strike began on May 2. (Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.67% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.93%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 9.29%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the entertainment company had lost 5.41% over the past month. This has lagged the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 0.11% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.65% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Walt Disney as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 9, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Walt Disney to post earnings of $1.02 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 6.42%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $22.52 billion, up 4.72% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.80 per share and revenue of $89.45 billion. These totals would mark changes of +7.65% and +8.13%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Walt Disney. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 1.3% lower. Walt Disney is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesLooking at its valuation, Walt Disney is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 23.2. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 23.2, which means Walt Disney is trading at a no noticeable deviation to the group.It is also worth noting that DIS currently has a PEG ratio of 1.96. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Media Conglomerates stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.76 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Media Conglomerates industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector.

The company's shares closed up 1.6% on Tuesday.The Wall Street Journal was first to report news of Disney's talks and said the company had reached out to at least one bank about ways to help the India business grow, while sharing some of the costs.The discussions come at a time when Disney has faced increasing pressure due to the emergence of Reliance Industries' streaming platform JioCinema, run by Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani. He has been marketing his streaming platform by offering free access to Indian Premier League cricket tournament, digital rights of which were earlier with Disney.Research firm CLSA has estimated Disney+ Hotstar's subscriber base shrank by nearly 5 million users in India after it lost the digital rights for IPL.Reliance's broadcast venture Viacom18, which runs JioCinema, also struck adealwith Warner Bros in April for HBO and other popular content such as Succession. Several of these top rated shows earlier aired in India on the Disney platform.Viacom18's shareholders include Reliance, Paramount Global as well as Bodhi Tree, which is a joint venture between James Murdoch and a former Star India executive, Uday Shankar.Disney's India business comprises the Disney+ Hotstar streaming service and Star India, which it took over when it acquired the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox in 2019.Story continuesThe source, who declined to be named as the talks are confidential, said it will be difficult to find an outright buyer in India as the enterprise value of the India business was seen around $15-16 billion when Disney took over Fox's business.Star India, which was rebranded as Disney Star last year, encompasses dozens of TV channels and a stake in a movie production company.Disney, like its peers in streaming and the wider media industry, is cutting costs as macro economic headwinds weigh on its advertising revenue and subscriber growth.In February, the company said it would cut 7,000 jobs as part of an effort to save $5.5 billion in costs in a sweeping restructuring of the company.

288,c2e06271-a94d-35f8-9e42-eb60b9641856,EXC,2023-07-12,Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) shareholders have earned a 20% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exelon-nasdaq-exc-shareholders-earned-113452335.html,1689161692,STORY,['EXC'],"[Buying a low-cost index fund will get you the average market return. But across the board there are plenty of stocks that underperform the market. That's what has happened with the Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) share price. It's up 10% over three years, but that is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 5.7% in the last year.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Exelon In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over the last three years, Exelon failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 5.6% (annualized).The strong decline in earnings per share suggests the market isn't using EPS to judge the company. So we'll need to take a look at some different metrics to try to understand why the share price remains solid.You can only imagine how long term shareholders feel about the declining revenue trend (slipping at 9.1% per year). The only thing that's clear is there is low correlation between Exelon's share price and its historic fundamental data. Further research may be required!The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Exelon will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Exelon, it has a TSR of 71% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 16% in the last year, Exelon shareholders lost 2.5% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 10% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Exelon better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Exelon (including 1 which can't be ignored) .If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE: OKE) (""ONEOK""). Magellan unitholders of record at the close of business on July 24, 2023 will be entitled to vote at the special meeting. The Magellan board of directors unanimously recommends that Magellan unitholders vote ""FOR"" the merger proposal.Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (PRNewsFoto/Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P.) (PRNewsFoto/)""Magellan's board is unanimous in its belief that the pending transaction maximizes value for Magellan unitholders,"" said Aaron Milford, Magellan's president and chief executive officer. ""Our number one job is maximizing value for our investors – and we believe this transaction does just that. Magellan's board and management team are confident the combined company will be stronger and more diversified, and the value created by this transaction for MMP unitholders is superior to the value of our standalone alternative, including on an after-tax basis.""Milford continued, ""We couldn't be more proud of Magellan's success delivering industry leading returns for investors, exceptional services for customers and rewarding careers for employees and believe this transaction further builds on our accomplishments. We urge all unitholders to vote 'FOR' the ONEOK merger in advance of the upcoming special meeting.""Magellan believes the transaction provides the following benefits:Full value for unitholders that is significantly greater than Magellan would expect to achieve on a standalone basis:  The transaction delivers a very attractive and full value to Magellan unitholders with a 22% premium, based on May 12, 2023 closing prices of Magellan units and ONEOK common stock. The implied Enterprise Value / 2023E Street Consensus EBITDA multiple at the announced transaction value represents 12.3x, which exceeds the trading multiples of all of MMP's midstream peers and the average midstream energy trading multiple of approximately 10x.The opportunity for Magellan unitholders to participate in the upside of a more resilient energy infrastructure company with greater scale and a compelling dividend through approximately 23% ownership of the combined company:  The combined company will benefit from a more diverse portfolio with assets across the NGL, natural gas, refined products and crude oil segments. Its greater scale and earnings diversity position it for greater growth and value creation across industry cycles as the energy transition and broader economy continue to evolve. The combined company will be more resilient and is expected to produce stable cash flows through diverse commodity cycles. In addition, ONEOK pays an attractive dividend. The transaction is also expected to be earnings per share (""EPS"") accretive to OKE beginning in 2024, with EPS accretion of approximately 3% to 7% per year from 2025 through 2027 and free cash flow per share accretion averaging more than 20% from 2024 through 2027.Attractive timing from a tax perspective as long-tenured unitholders are approaching a sharp increase in taxes owed:  The transaction does not create new taxes except those resulting from the premium value received and, other than timing, does not alter unitholders' existing tax liability. Magellan forecasts a more limited capital investment environment for our business going forward, which together with the underlying mechanics of income allocation, means unitholders can expect Magellan to generate more taxable income and less depreciation to allocate to limited partners, resulting in higher annual taxes owed by unitholders. Magellan estimates that long-tenured unitholders will soon owe taxes each year that amount to approximately 60% of the distributions they receive. Magellan believes the value created for MMP unitholders by ownership in the combined entity, together with the cash consideration, exceeds the expected value the MMP unitholders could likely capture through continued ownership of MMP standalone, including after taking taxes into consideration. For the vast majority of unitholders, Magellan expects the cash portion of the consideration to more than cover the federal tax owed following the close of the ONEOK transaction.Story continuesMagellan unitholders who need assistance in completing the proxy card, need additional copies of the proxy materials or have questions regarding the upcoming special meeting may contact Magellan's proxy solicitor, Morrow Sodali, LLC, by phone at (800) 662-5200 or (203) 658-9400 or by email at MMP@info.morrowsodali.com.As previously announced on May 14, under the terms of the merger agreement, ONEOK will acquire all outstanding units of Magellan in a cash-and-stock transaction to create a combined company with a total enterprise value of approximately $60 billion. Each Magellan unitholder will receive $25.00 in cash and 0.667 shares of ONEOK stock per unit upon completion of the pending merger.Magellan continues to expect the transaction to close in the third quarter of 2023 subject to customary closing conditions, including the approvals of both ONEOK shareholders and Magellan unitholders. As a result of the expiration of the waiting period under Hart-Scott Rodino (""HSR"") on June 26, 2023, the antitrust regulatory conditions to complete the transaction have been met.Advisors:Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.

291,f3922189-3bed-36ac-a94e-bfab26735da3,MTB,2023-07-12,11 Best Local Bank Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-local-bank-stocks-160002330.html,1689091202,STORY,"['BAC', 'USB', 'PACW', 'MTB', 'HBAN', 'EWBC', 'RF', 'KEY']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 best local bank stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To skip our detailed analysis of the banking industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Local Bank Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The 2023 Banking CrisisIn March 2023, the US banking industry witnessed a severe crisis with the failure of three small-to-mid-sized banks. These included Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Silvergate Bank, and Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY). The collapse of these three banks sent the US public into a panic. The SVB collapse, in particular, led to a significant uproar considering the fact that the bank's clients included major technology companies and wealthy individuals who had made large deposits with the bank. Rising interest rates had led to these three banks suffering large unrealized losses on US Treasury bond holdings, and the resulting failures of these institutions set in motion the 2023 banking crisis.The banking industry has managed to settle down somewhat since March, especially since the Federal Reserve made promises to honor the deposits of the three failing banks. Here's a comment from the Federal Reserve's Chair, Jerome Powell, on the situation, made this March:""You have seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when there's a threat of serious harm to the economy or to the financial system, and we're prepared to use those tools. I think depositors should assume that their deposits are safe.""Despite the above statement, it is to be noted that Chairman Powell sidestepped the question of whether the Federal Reserve is prepared to bail out the depositors of banks with less than $1 billion in assets in the event that such a bank fails. Thus while the Fed seems to have extended a guarantee for the deposits of larger banks, the situation seems unclear when it comes to smaller banks and their depositors, throwing the clientele of such banks and the institutions into a frenzy over what to expect from the Fed in the event that the banking crisis worsens.Story continuesBig Banks May Be In The Clear, But What About Small Banks?Additionally, according to CNBC, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also commented this March that not all banks in the US, regardless of their size, would be fully insured. So while US bank regulators managed to fully insure the deposits of SVB and Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY), this treatment has not been promised to all other US banks in the event of a collapse, leaving smaller banks and their depositors in a state of paranoia. This paranoia also led to smaller US banks facing increased amounts of withdrawals while mega-banks began gaining in deposits. According to a Wall Street Journal article from this March, after the SVB collapse, the 25 largest banks in the US gained about $120 billion in deposits, as shown by Federal Reserve data. At the same time, smaller US banks suffered from losses amounting to $108 billion over the same period.In his interview on CNBC this March, Nelson Peltz, the founder of Trian Fund Management, commented on this situation:""All the money as we know is leaving the small community banks and the regional banks and going to the three or four largest banks in America, and that's a very dangerous situation, and it's got to be resolved. What I would do is this: I would put together a plan that applies only to the US banks, and that the Fed gets an insurance premium for any money you leave in a US-accredited bank over $250,000. So you're creating income for the Fed, and in exchange for that they insure the coverage.""The plan put forth by Peltz envisions a guarantee from the Fed for all bank deposits regardless of the bank's size while also charging the bank's customers for that insurance. However, no such policy has been adopted by the Fed at present, leaving local US banks in a state of uncertainty while large banks like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) continue to gain. As of July 9, for instance, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is up by 6.82% year-to-date, while shares of smaller banks like Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) are down by 22.77% year-to-date.While the situation seems dire, it should be noted that the outflow of deposits from small banks cooled down since the initial frenzy right after the collapse of SVB and the other two banks, as CNBC reported near the end of March. This means that smaller US banks may have more hope than initially expected. As such, the investing public is looking for the best regional bank stocks to buy now or the best small bank stocks to invest in as the banking crisis cools down. As such, we have compiled a list of these stocks below.11 Best Local Bank Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Mikel Parera on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe selected local American bank stocks that were the most popular among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey during the first quarter of 2023 to compile our list below. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number.Best Local Bank Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds11. PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Brandon King at Truist Securities has a Hold rating on PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW)  shares as of June 29, alongside a $10 price target.PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) is a local US bank based in Los Angeles, California. It offers business banking and treasury management services.PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) was spotted in the 13F holdings of 22 hedge funds during the first quarter, with a total stake value of $139 million.Manole Capital Management mentioned PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“25 years ago, there were 13,000 financial institutions, but now there’s really only 4,000 banks left. Will we continue to see consolidation? With JP Morgan buying First Republic, the latest worry seems to PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW). In a recent security filing, it reported that it lost 9.5% of its total deposits, with most of it happening over two days. For PacWest and other regional banks, they are fighting a two-sided battle. On one side, investors are finally demanding higher yields and the media is highlighting the risk of keeping assets at struggling banks. On the other side, short sellers are eager to identify the next possible “weak (banking) link”.”10. East West Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23East West Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC) is a regional bank based in Pasadena, California. It is the bank holding company for East West Bank.Truist Securities analyst Jennifer Demba holds a Buy rating on East West Bancorp, Inc.

(NASDAQ:EWBC) at the end of the first quarter, making it the largest shareholder in the company.Aristotle Capital Management mentioned East West Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC) in its first-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We purchased East West Bancorp in the third quarter of 2017; however, our history with the business stretches back further having twice previously invested. Companies we consider to be high-quality like East West tend to remain high quality, and we have long admired the business for its uniqueness among the otherwise homogenous U.S. banking industry. Its dominant market share built over generations in Asian communities – and difficult-to-replicate experience due to culture, geography and business practices – create distinct competitive advantages in our view. During our most recent holding period, the bank achieved sustained loan growth, a catalyst we identified, through its continued leadership position as the financial “bridge” for customers doing business in the U.S. and China. Moreover, East West also realized market share gains in its headquarters state of California. With these catalysts nearing completion, we decided to exit our investment to fund the purchase of Oshkosh. As always, we will continue to study East West and, in the future, may once again find an opportunity to be investors.”Like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), East West Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC) is a bank stock worth keeping an eye on in the second half of 2023.9. Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Betsy Graseck at Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating on Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) shares on June 26, alongside a $25 price target.Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) is a regional bank providing financial services to individual and corporate customers.

KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) is a diversified banking company and the holding company for KeyBank National Association. It is based in Cleveland, Ohio.Gerard Cassidy at RBC Capital maintains an Outperform rating on KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) shares as of June 13, alongside a price target of $14.Out of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the first quarter, 34 funds were long KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), with a total stake value of $573 million.6.

Importantly, MTB has neither the same kind of client concentration risk nor duration risk that impacted Silicon Valley Bank. Particularly with respect to duration risk, MTB was an outlier in its conservatism with respect to buying shorter-term securities in a very low rate environment. MTB does have exposure to commercial real estate, including office real estate. While we do expect some elevated credit losses in this portion of the loan portfolio, we note MTB has historically been an effective manager of risk, and we remain confident that management has behaved with appropriate caution.”Like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), M&amp;T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB) is a bank stock that is popular among elite hedge funds today.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Local Bank Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Suggested articles:Top 20 Most Profitable Banks in the World10 Best Small Cap Bank Stocks With Dividends10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure: None. 11 Best Local Bank Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

""Legacy, centralized cloud architecture was not designed for the demands of developers and companies challenged with delivering better user experiences that increasingly require putting applications and data closer to the customer.""Akamai is taking a fundamentally new approach to cloud computing that shifts how developers and companies build, deploy, and secure applications and data across the entire continuum of computing from core to edge. For the rollout of the new sites, Akamai reimagined conventional data center design principles. In addition to scaling its core cloud computing services, Akamai also used its vast content delivery experience to connect each site to the company's massive global backbone. In doing so, Akamai brings the simplicity, affordability, and accessibility of its Linode-based cloud computing services to larger commercial customers on an architecture built for the next decade, not the last.Story continuesFive New SitesStrategically located in Paris, Washington, D.C., and Chicago, with Seattle and Chennai, India opening later this quarter, Akamai's new sites feature a new architecture design and hardware configuration to enable high-performance, scalable cloud resources for commercial users on the Akamai global network.Akamai's new site in Washington, D.C., puts a stake in the ground in what is often considered the data center hub of the world. Northern Virginia contains more than half of the total primary data center market inventory in the United States.The company's new Chicago site gives Akamai customers access to cloud computing services in the fifth top data center market in the world. It's an attractive replication option for latency-sensitive, multicloud workloads running in Philadelphia and Washington.Akamai's presence in Seattle gives the company access to a growing community of developer and startup customers. Seattle is the eighth-largest market in the U.S. and has become a major data center hub for companies in the Pacific Northwest.Its new Paris site positions Akamai to help companies in the European Union address growing data sovereignty challenges. Paris has the highest density data center capacity in Europe.Akamai's new site in Chennai will give the company greater access to one of the largest IT hubs in India. In an April 2023 survey of its partners, Akamai found that 48% of respondents in India estimated that between 21-40% of IT budgets would be spent on cloud.""Next generation applications demand cloud infrastructure that provides dramatically lower latency and better egress than what's currently possible from today's legacy cloud providers,"" said Karon. ""What we're building is designed for that new world. We have a unique advantage of seeing the cloud from a different perspective than most given the nature of our business and customer base. And the feedback we increasingly hear, not only from our own customers but our competitors' customers, is that our edge-in vision solves many of the scale and portability challenges they face with the current centralized cloud options available to them.""New Premium InstancesThe company also announced new premium instances that deliver consistent performance, predictable resource and budget allocation, and simpler SKU management for larger commercial workloads. The new instance types guarantee assignment to the best performing processor and hardware combination available. They can also make it easier to manage multiple deployments and upgrades without complicated SKU matching which can often see in excess of 100,000 changes a month across the top three legacy hyperscale providers.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Cybersecurity Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Relentless cyber attacks from hackers, continuously evolving techniques of cyber criminals and the risks and costs attached with cybersecurity-related problems are causing companies around the world to take cybersecurity extremely seriously and spend a fortune in making sure they don’t become victim to the next big cyber attack. A detailed report by WSJ took a look at how the changing landscape of global information and online security industry is affecting the mindset of top-level executives, especially Chief Information Officers. The report cited James Beeson, Cigna’s Chief Information Security Officer, who said:“Having the CIO as the champion for cybersecurity is absolutely critical. You’ve got to work directly with the business. You’ve got to realize that cybersecurity and making decisions about mitigation is really a balancing act.”Part of the reason why companies have started to take cybersecurity extremely seriously is pressure from governments, regulators and investors. The SEC published some rules in this regard back in 2022 which the body is expected to finalize in the coming months. The SEC wants company board members to have expertise and clear policies regarding cybersecurity and how to protect company and investor assets from cyber attacks.After these rules, companies will have to make sure they have qualified and experienced members in their boards who know the gravity of cyber attacks and strategies to protect against such attacks.This cybersecurity emergency is proving to be extremely profitable for cybersecurity stocks.Challenges to Endpoint Security Systems and Evolving Cyber AttacksOn the other hand hackers are swiftly finding new ways to bypass advanced cybersecurity tools. One of the best and most efficient ways to detect and prevent against cyber attacks is endpoint security systems and software. However, a Bloomberg report recently cited data from Mandiant, which said the company investigated 84 instances where endpoint security software were tampered with or disabled. For instance, in December 2022, Microsoft revealed that attackers were able to get the company’s systems apply its seal of authenticity to malware, which was then used to disable the company’s EDR and other security tools on victim networks.Story continuesLike other industries, AI is also affecting the cybersecurity industry and companies have already started using generative AI tools like ChatGPT to assist their employees in addition to deploying complex and technical AI-based cybersecurity tools to beef up their fences against hackers. Recently, toy company Mattel revealed that it has started experimenting with generative AI tools like ChatGPT to help its cybersecurity teams. However, the company is aware of the risks involved in using such tools. According to a WSJ report, Mattel’s chief information security officer Tom Le said that generative AI tools perform tasks like parsing large datasets and help cyber analysts, giving them time to do more important tasks.However, the executive said that the company is aware of the threats involved in using such tools and that’s why it hasn’t deployed these tools at a broader level.“Right now, anything that I would use the AI engine for, it would only be to complement what I already have,” Le reportedly said.Earlier this year new  under-discussion policies from the Biden administration made rounds in the media that sought to hold software companies and device makers responsible in case of cyber attacks. According to media reports, the policy document said:“Responsibility must be placed on the stakeholders most capable of taking action to prevent bad outcomes, not on the end-users that often bear the consequences of insecure software nor on the open-source developer of a component that is integrated into a commercial product.”The number of cyber attacks keeps growing as hackers continue to adapt and learn new ways to attack user data and online assets. A detailed report on NASDAQ said that the total number of major cyber attacks reported in the news were higher in every month in 2020 (except April), when compared with 2019 and 2018. The most important thing to note in the report is the cost of data breaches. Cyber attacks don’t just affect the reputation of companies. They cost companies a fortune which is often more than the investments that they can make for preventive measures. The NASDAQ report cited data from research done by IBM and Ponemon Institute which says that average total cost of a data breach in 2021 was $4.24 million in 2021, up from $3.86 million in 2020. The report also said that few industries are more prone to cyber attacks. These industries include healthcare, financial, and pharmaceutical industries.Given this backdrop more and more analysts are growing bullish on cybersecurity stocks and believe they are good bets for long-term investors. Recently, Catharine Trebnick, senior research analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, said in an interview with BNN Bloomberg that cybersecurity stocks can grow as much as over 20% amid deal-making in the industry and growing demand. Specifically, Trebnick said she’s bullish on Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NYSE:PANW), Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD).Most Undervalued Cybersecurity Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by Obie Fernandez on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings and picked the most popular cybersecurity stocks among these funds with PE ratios less than 25 as of June 30.

Additional locations will be connected to Comcast’s network and full suite of services as construction continues through February 2024.“High-speed Internet access increases job and population growth, sparks higher rates of new business formation and home values, and lowers unemployment rates,” said Rodrigo Lopez, Senior Regional Vice President of Comcast’s Pacific Northwest Region. “That is why Comcast is committed to expanding its existing network to residents, businesses and communities in Oregon that currently do not have access to reliable, high-speed internet.”Comcast began construction in March and expects to extend its network to approximately 1,700 homes and businesses this year with the potential to add more locations next year. Once construction is complete, all of these homes will have access to to all Xfinity Internet service offerings with speeds faster than 1 Gig and advanced WiFi technology from powerful gateways capable of delivering reliable and consistent connections for real-time activities like gaming, live streaming, and video conferencing with ultra-low lag.Residents will also have access to Flex, a solution to help users search less and watch more with a voice-controlled 4K streaming TV box, putting everyone’s favorite streaming apps all in one place, the award-winning Xfinity X1 video platform, Xfinity Home, Comcast’s professionally installed home security solution, and Xfinity Mobile, a top ranked service in customer satisfaction that can save customers hundreds of dollars a year on their mobile bills.Story continuesFor local businesses, Comcast Business offers a suite of connectivity, cybersecurity, managed solutions and Comcast Business Mobile products designed specifically for their employee’s needs. Powered by the nation’s largest Gig-speed broadband network, and backed by 24/7 customer support, Comcast Business is the nation’s largest cable and internet provider to small and mid-size businesses and one of the leading providers to larger organizations in the Enterprise market.“The Estacada Chamber of Commerce is proud to welcome Comcast to our expanding community, providing residents and businesses with another option when selecting their Internet provider,” said a spokesperson for the Chamber. “This expansion, combined with Eagle Creek, makes our area an even more attractive place to work and live, especially meeting the needs of our members today and into the future for reliable and fast broadband network, which is more important than ever.”The network expansion is the latest example of Comcast’s investment to connect more households and businesses in the Pacific Northwest to its Internet services that deliver fast speeds, more reliability, broader coverage in the home, and greater capacity to support customers’ growing Internet usage. Comcast expanded service to more than 19,000 additional homes and businesses last year in Oregon. Further, the company has invested more than $534 million in technology and infrastructure investments in Oregon during the previous three years, including network expansion and upgrades.Powered by the Xfinity 10G NetworkComcast’s network and Internet experience are powering homes and businesses today and into the future:Ultimate Capacity: Xfinity customers connect 1 billion devices across the company’s network annually. The Xfinity 10G Network with the next-generation Xfinity gateways deliver the most advanced WiFi technology carrying three times more bandwidth to power streaming, gaming, videoconferencing, and more, simultaneously.Fastest Internet: More than a third of Xfinity Internet customers subscribe to gigabit speed products, and symmetrical gig speeds are coming to the first homes this year.Unprecedented Coverage: The latest Xfinity Gateway provides a more reliable connection throughout the home. Customers can get wall-to-wall WiFi coverage with a powerful Xfinity WiFi Boost Pod that extends coverage to hard-to-reach areas, with plans for an offering of increased support for in-home WiFi through a “boost guarantee” later this year.Most Reliable Connection: Comcast is scaling the nation’s largest and most reliable network – the Xfinity 10G Network – that passes 60 million homes and businesses and counting. The company plans to launch a new device that is “storm ready” with cellular and battery backup to help keep customers connected even when the power goes out.Ultra-Low Latency: The Xfinity 10G Network and the latest Xfinity Gateway are a powerful combination that deliver ultra-low latency for those moments when response times matter most like video games, a fast-growing category with Xfinity households averaging more than one gaming console per home.Eagle Creek and Estacada residents also will have access to Internet Essentials, the largest and most comprehensive low-cost Internet adoption program for low-income Americans. Comcast proudly participates in the Affordable Connectivity Program, and offers Internet Essentials Plus, a $29.95/month home Internet service that is effectively free for eligible households, once the ACP credit is applied.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Roku (ROKU) earns a Zacks Rank #3 16 days from its next quarterly earnings release on July 27, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at -$0.52 a share.Roku's Earnings ESP sits at 57.17%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the -$0.52 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$1.21.ROKU is part of a big group of Consumer Discretionary stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Comcast (CMCSA) as well.Comcast, which is readying to report earnings on July 27, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.99 a share, and CMCSA is 16 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Comcast is $0.98, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.22%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, ROKU and CMCSA could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

(NYSE:URI)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-consider-buying-united-rentals-110043150.html,1689159643,STORY,['URI'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine United Rentals’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for United Rentals Is United Rentals Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, United Rentals seems to be fairly priced at around 3.3% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy United Rentals today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $473.06, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because United Rentals’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will United Rentals generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 32% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for United Rentals. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in URI’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on URI, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into United Rentals, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Buy for a Month.The momentum investing philosophy aims to leverage price movements of stocks. The key idea behind momentum investing is that price trends of stocks can persist for a certain time and investors can/should ride those trends and make the most out of them. If a stock is showing signs of going up, buy that stock and ride the upward price trend and sell it as soon as it shows signs of peaking. That’s momentum investing in simple terms and it sure looks straightforward and easy on paper. But does research provides any backing to this investment philosophy? Let’s find out.Several research papers have shown stock momentum does play a key role in stock movements. These research papers show that stock prices do not follow random paths. Instead, their past movements and trends can help investors predict and foresee their future trends to some extent. In a paper titled The 52-Week High and Momentum Investing, Thomas George and Chuan-Yang Hwang quote research from Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) which says that stock returns show “momentum behavior at intermediate horizons.”  The paper also says that a strategy that buys the top 10% and sells the bottom 10% of stocks ranked by returns during the past 6 months, and holds the positions for 6 months, produces profits of 1% per month.  The paper also quotes research from Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999) which says that momentum in individual stock returns is driven by momentum in industry returns.The paper then shows the importance of 52-week highs and lows in investing and how different biases come into play in investors’ thought process when a stock hits 52-week high or low. The paper says:“Our results indicate that the 52-week measure has predictive power whether or not individual stocks have had extreme past returns. This suggests that price level is important, and is consistent with an anchor-and-adjust bias. Traders appear to use the 52-week high as a reference point against which they evaluate the potential impact of news. When good news has pushed a stock’s price near or to a new 52-week high, traders are reluctant to bid the price of the stock higher even if the information warrants it. The information eventually prevails and the price moves up, resulting in a continuation. Similarly, when bad news pushes a stock’s price far from its 52-week high, traders are initially unwilling to sell the stock at prices that are as low as the information implies. The information eventually prevails and the price falls.”Story continuesAnother famous research backs the claims on effectiveness of momentum investor. According to data from University of Chicago finance professor (and Nobel laureate) Eugene Fama and Dartmouth College finance professor Kenneth French, since 1927, a portfolio holding 10% of stocks with the best trailing 12-month returns would have beaten the broader market by 6.7 annualized percentage points.AQR Capital in 2009 published a detailed research paper on momentum investing titled “The Case for Momentum Investing.” The paper summarized various studies and researches that point to the effectiveness of momentum investing. For example, the paper demonstrates  average annual returns for portfolios grouped by momentum for a period starting from January 1927 to December 2008. The data shows that stocks with the best momentum easily outperform the stocks with the worst momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to the equity market as a whole.The AQR research paper also highlights an important psychological factor that plays a key role in the success of momentum investing. Whenever a stock rises based on good news, the average investor tends to sell the stock to lock the gains. On the other hand when a company announces bad news, the average investor would hold on to the stock instead of quickly selling it in hopes of breaking even. This psychological factor is directly linked to momentum investing. The paper says:""Investors (as human beings) are prone to what behavioral economists and experimental psychologists call the disposition effect. Investors tend to sell winning investments prematurely to lock in gains, and hold on to losing investments too long in the hope of breaking even. The disposition effect creates an artificial headwind: when good news is announced, the price of an asset does not immediately rise to its value because of premature selling. Similarly, when bad news is announced, the price falls less because investors are reluctant to sell.""Tobias J. Moskowitz, PhD, in his paper titled Momentum Investing: Finally Accessible for Individual Investors, shares some data which compares the performance of long-only momentum portfolio to other long-only stock investing strategy during a 30-year period starting from December 1979 to December 2009. The analysis shows that momentum investing outperformed the market or a core index portfolio by a wide margin. For large-cap stocks, momentum outperformed the Russell 1000 by about 2 percent a year. A small-cap momentum index outperformed the Russell 2000 by 3.7 percent a year. In addition, momentum outperformed value by 1.5 percent a year and growth by more than 3 percent a year.Best Stocks to Buy for a MonthOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned the holdings of iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) and picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

To skip our detailed analysis of the podcast and Discovery Capital Management's holdings, you can go directly to see the second part of Rob Citrone Podcast and Top 5 Stock Picks.Today, Rob Citrone is an American billionaire hedge fund manager and one of the co-founders of Discovery Capital Management. However, a quick dive into his background shows that Citrone comes from ""modest roots,"" as he himself put it in a Capital Allocators with Ted Seides podcast last July. Citrone began by saving up and sticking his money in money market funds and mutual funds. From here, Citrone began investing in stocks and developed a love for the investment field. During the start of his career on Wall Street, Citrone became involved in emerging markets through his work during the Latin American debt crisis. He moved on to Fidelity Investments in Boston and began heading the company's emerging markets fixed income and currency group. After this, he jumped to Tiger Management, where he worked as a portfolio manager as well before he eventually founded Discovery Capital.Citrone's Comparisons: The Economy of the Past Versus 2022In this podcast, Citrone offers valuable insights into the state of the US economy today while drawing comparisons between past financial crises in emerging markets and the US markets today. Here are some of his comments on his experience during the 1987 stock market crash:""I can remember the crash in '87, and I can remember it was one of the longest days that I ever experienced. I think we just stared at the screens and we were just in shock that the equity market was down 20 some percent in a day. But then the Fed came in and just eased liquidity massively. It was an interesting time to buy, obviously, and we could see that and feel that. That's why things recovered very quickly. The amount of liquidity they pumped into the system had a huge impact.""Story continuesOn noting the above, Citrone added that the situation back then was different from how it was in 2022. He noted the following:""Today the problem is we can't do that, we've already done that. Now we have to go the other way, actually take liquidity out of the market. Even if the market will crash, there's not much the Fed can do because of the inflation issue.""The way Citrone saw it, by July 2022, the US market was entering the second phase of the market correction, the first phase being inflation. In the second phase, Citrone expected to see a ""significant withdrawal of liquidity"" from the market. While comparing the US economy in the present to the way it used to be, he also noted a significant difference, considering the fact that significantly more people have their wealth circulating in the market today compared to in 1987.Positions and Opinions On Global Markets and IndustriesMoving forward, Citrone was questioned on the positions he was taking in the market. On this front, he noted that the Chinese currency is ""a great short,"" making it one of his larger positions. In fact, Citrone mentioned that he had been shorting China since August 2021. However, he had decided to ""temper"" this position in the event either that President Xi Jinping did not get a second term or that he got the second term and ended up surrounded by ""reformers."" For Citrone, these events would result in him altering his bearish view of China. In terms of the rest of the world, Citrone mentioned that he was bullish on the US and on India, with the latter being dubbed by him as ""the new growth country of the world."" He also expected Latin America, particularly Brazil, to go through a recovery period which would make it an excellent investment opportunity. However, he views Africa as a difficult region to approach because of political instability in countries like South Africa.As the podcast progressed, Citrone was questioned on his opinion on the technology industry. He said the following:""Technology is still a fantastic area to invest in going forward, but I still think that the multiples are too high for most companies. Anytime a company's still being priced to sales, or they're talking about the TAM, I want nothing to do with that company.""While he noted that he expects technology companies to be challenged during 2023, he did add that the industry was a good long-term investment opportunity. All in all, Citrone highlighted some important viewpoints on a number of issues during the podcast, ranging from his past experiences and his opinions on various global markets to specific industries and businesses such as the technology industry and the hedge fund business. He has managed to successfully maintain a portfolio including several major companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) through the years, highlighting his keen eye for profitable investment opportunities as they spring up. The performance of his portfolio has also been commendable. According to Bloomberg, Discovery Capital ended 2022 up 18%, and in January, the fund gained 4%. The January gain made it one of the only hedge funds actually to make money during the market instability seen at the start of 2023. As a result, Citrone has established himself as an investor to follow today, leading us to compile a list of his top holdings.Rob Citrone Podcast and Stock PicksOur MethodologyWe have selected Discovery Capital Management's top 10 holdings, according to the hedge fund's 13F holdings filed this March on Insider Monkey.

(NYSE:UNH), Denbury Inc. (NYSE:DEN) is among Citrone's top holdings this year.8. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 155Number of Shares Held by Discovery Capital Management: 302,300Portfolio Percentage: 3.56%Justin Post at BofA holds a Buy rating on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares as of June 15, alongside a $128 price target.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a big tech company operating in the interactive media and services industry. It is based in Mountain View, California.There were 155 hedge funds long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $18.6 billion.Manole Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Despite this, the S&amp;P 500 is up 7% this year and the Nasdaq is up +11%. Technology rebounded from a challenging 2022 and many large tech companies are performing quite well this year. Through mid-May 2023, year-to-date performance of some of the most popular and largest names tech names is impressive. For tech companies with market capitalizations over $1 trillion, Apple is up +35%, Microsoft +33%, Amazon +39%, and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is +40%. If you add in Nvdia, Google and Meta, you have three quarters of the entire S&amp;P 500’s year-to-date return.For our purposes, we are just going to focus on software digital wallets, as they are much more common and accessible. If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay pre-loaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use. Those two, along with Google Pay and PayPal, are the four most popular digital wallets today. According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%.We are loyal Apple users (iPhones, iPads, iMac) and find their Apple Pay to be a convenient and safe digital wallet to use. It is currently accepted at more than 90% of US retailers, so it clearly has widespread adoption. Samsung and Google users also seem pleased with their preferred digital wallets. In our opinion, these new entrants are “a bit too late to the party” to make a meaningful dent versus established players.As of today, both Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay have a distinct advantage in the digital wallet arena. These three firms have spent billions of dollars ensuring that their apps are easy to use on their smartphones. Plus, and maybe more importantly, the consumer experience is embedded and native to the operating system. This ties their digital wallet to the device, which cannot be replicated.”7. Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Number of Shares Held by Discovery Capital Management: 216,489Portfolio Percentage: 4.13%At the end of the first quarter, 48 hedge funds were long Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET). Their total stake value was $1.4 billion.On May 2, Jim Kelleher at Argus Research maintained a Buy rating on Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) shares, alongside placing a $195 price target on the stock.Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) is an information technology company. It is based in Santa Clara, California.Giverny Capital Asset Management, LLC said the following about Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Our holding Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) continues to generate extraordinary results, which the market recognizes. Arista rose 38% during the first quarter and became our largest holding. Arista makes switches, routers and operating software that power enormous data networks, such as for cloud computing. Microsoft’s Azure cloud business and Meta Platforms’ Facebook and Instagram networks are Arista’s two most important customers. Roughly speaking, Arista has tripled its revenue and profit over the past five years and seems poised to continue growing rapidly for the foreseeable future. Demand for hyperscale computing networks may accelerate as artificial intelligence (AI) chat applications grow. By some estimates, the computer power required to answer Al chat queries is roughly seven times more than for a Google or Bing search. I think the realization that data network capacity needs to be much larger to accommodate Al has driven recent enthusiasm for Arista.In general, I think when a stock blows through my price target the right answer is to bask in the glory and maybe splurge on a latte rather than my usual morning coffee. Don’t get itchy about locking in a profit. In this case, Arista became our largest holding and roughly 8.5% of the portfolio, while also being one of the most expensive businesses we own on a price-to-earnings basis. Arista earned $4.27 in 2022 and I believe there is good reason to expect it to double EPS again, perhaps by 2026 or 2027. But as the stock traded into the $160s, that represents a PE of 20x estimated earnings in four years. While I believe strongly in Arista’s competitive position, I know that tech giants are facing budget constraints and a pause in their own intense pace of infrastructure growth would not surprise anyone….” (Click here to read the full text)Like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) is a highly popular stock among hedge funds today.6. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128Number of Shares Held by Discovery Capital Management: 422,065Portfolio Percentage: 4.9%Citadel Investment Group was the most prominent shareholder in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) at the end of the first quarter, holding 11.4 million shares.Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is a leading Chinese company operating in the broad-line retail and e-commerce spaces. It is based in Hangzhou, China.In total, 128 hedge funds were long Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $5.9 billion.A Buy rating was reiterated on Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) shares on June 21 by Fawne Jiang at Benchmark, who also maintained a $180 price target on the stock.Here's what Baron Funds had to say about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is the largest retailer and e-commerce company in China. Alibaba operates shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall and owns 33% of Ant Group, which operates Alipay, China’s largest third-party online payment provider. Shares of Alibaba were up this quarter, given meaningful margin expansion, guidance to stabilize core commerce market share in China, and an announced plan to split the company into six units which could further unlock value. We retain conviction that Alibaba is well positioned to benefit from China’s reopening and the ongoing growth in online commerce and cloud in China.”Click to continue reading and see Rob Citrone's Top 5 Stock Picks.Suggested articles:George Soros’ Top 10 Stock PicksLong-Term Stock Portfolio: Best Stocks for 20 YearsKanye West Stock Portfolio vs. Warren Buffett Stock PortfolioDisclosure: None.

308,4dbf031a-9a54-3567-bbad-05543cf913e7,HAS,2023-07-12,Hasbro (HAS) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hasbro-expected-beat-earnings-estimates-140021276.html,1689084021,STORY,['HAS'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Hasbro (HAS) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis toy maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.57 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -50.4%.Revenues are expected to be $1.11 billion, down 17.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.1% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hasbro?For Hasbro, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +16.67%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Hasbro will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Hasbro would post earnings of $0.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.01, delivering a surprise of -75%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Hasbro appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of franchises and the current franchise industry prospects, and see the top 5 entries in this list by clicking the 5 Most Profitable Franchises To Buy in 2023.When a business wants to increase its market share or geographical reach at a low cost, it may franchise its product and brand name. A franchise is a joint venture between a franchisor and a franchisee, with the franchisor being the original business that sells the right to use its name and idea, while the franchisee buys this right to sell the franchisor's goods or services under an existing business model and trademark. This practice is common in a variety of segments across the global economy and encompasses some of the most well-known companies in the world.The franchise industry is skyrocketing and achieving incredible growth in terms of business, with the economic output of franchise establishments in the United States reaching about $790 billion in 2021. According to the International Franchise Association's (IFA) 2023 Economic Report, the overall number of franchise establishments is expected to increase by almost 15,000 units, or 1.9%, to 805,000 units which will in turn, add approximately 254,000 jobs in 2023. Growing at 3.0%, total franchise employment is forecasted to reach 8.7 million. Additionally, the report states that franchises’ GDP is anticipated to grow at a pace of 4.2% to $521.3 billion. Given these factors, it is anticipated that the growth in employment will be driven mostly by business services, personal services, and quick-service restaurants. In 2023, business services are projected to contribute a growth rate of 5.2% to the overall labor force, while personal services are expected to add 4.7%. As a consequence, some franchises tend to push ahead of their competitors as they exhibit growth that would place them as the fastest-growing franchises in the world.Story continuesOn the other hand, qualified labor availability and workforce costs continue to pose the most significant challenge for nearly all franchised businesses. The latest labor survey conducted by IFA/FRANdata in 2023 reveals that 81% of franchised brands faced growth limitations attributed to labor-related issues, which is consistent with the challenges observed in 2022.The franchise industry is dominated by fast food or quick-service restaurants. According to Polaris Market Research, the booming quick service restaurant (QSR) industry was valued at $173.72 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.9% during the forecast period. While 2022 was a challenging year for QSRs due to supply constraints, labor shortages, and high inflation rates, personal services and QSRs are expected to lead the growth in franchised units in 2023, expanding by 2.5% year-over-year despite a decline in consumer spending, due to the strong demand for food deliveries. Major players in the QSR industry, include big household names such as McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Burger King Worldwide Inc (NYSE:BKW), and The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN).While franchises seem to be a lucrative source of income, they come at a high price as there usually an initial investment that is required in order to open the business. In order to become a franchise owner, each business establishes its own set of conditions, which typically include an initial franchise fee, a minimum net worth requirement, and a minimum liquid assets requirement. Moreover, each company imposes a basic and advertising royalty fee, the specific amounts of which may differ between companies. As an example, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD),  franchisee applicants must have a minimum of $500,000 available in liquid assets and pay a $45,000 franchise fee. Those looking to launch a new McDonald's franchise can expect to shell out between $1,314,500 and $2,306,500. Similarly, prospective Ace Hardware franchise owners must have roughly $250,000 in liquid capital, with a minimum net worth of at least $400,000. Other than the initial investment, there are annual licensing fee, and royalty that are paid by the franchisee over the tenure of the business. Most franchise businesses typically provide easily accessible online applications for people interested in applying for a franchise. Additionally, these businesses generally offer a rough estimation of the initial investment necessary to establish and operate the franchise.There are many advantages, and drawbacks, that come with investing in a franchise. The most profitable franchises include a ready-made business formula to follow since a franchise usually comes with market-tested products and services, and in many cases established brand recognition. Consumers prefer a proven quality product over new brands. In that same vein, it is expected that the same quality products are offered by brands all over the world irrespective of the region. On the other hand, franchises, by definition, have ongoing fees that must be paid to the franchisor in the form of a percentage of sales or revenue. This percentage can range between 4.6% and 12.5%, depending on the industry. Additionally, franchisees may have limited autonomy in running their business, as they must adhere to the franchisor's established system and standards.In the United States, there is a vast array of businesses that provide franchising opportunities to aspiring entrepreneurs and investors. Our list of the 20 Most Profitable Franchises in the World highlights some of the notable contenders, such as RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:RMAX), Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and various subsidiaries of Yum! Brands, Inc.

Large cap-centric indexes like the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite rallied 15.9% and 31.7%, respectively. The small cap -centric Russell 2000 and the mid cap-centric S&amp;P 400 advanced more than 5% and 7%, respectively. However, the blue-chip Dow gained only 3.8%.Importantly, the rally in the first half rally was primarily driven by growth stocks like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary. These stocks have a relatively low weight in Dow rather than the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. The cyclical stocks, which have more weight in Dow, did not participate in the rally.However, the situation likely to change in the second half. At present, cyclical stocks are undervalued. Technically, at its current level of 33,944.40, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 33,662.29 and 32,992.06, respectively.The 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as a short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trend setter.

326,46d760cc-a3c5-3ce1-9f85-0e247ae869a6,TROW,2023-07-12,Is T. Rowe Price Tax-Efficient Equity (PREFX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-tax-efficient-110006962.html,1689159606,STORY,['TROW'],"[Mutual Fund Equity Report fund seekers should consider taking a look at T. Rowe Price Tax-Efficient Equity (PREFX). PREFX possesses a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerT. Rowe Price is based in Baltimore, MD, and is the manager of PREFX. T. Rowe Price Tax-Efficient Equity debuted in December of 2000. Since then, PREFX has accumulated assets of about $250.73 million, according to the most recently available information. Donald J. Peters is the fund's current manager and has held that role since December of 2000.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 11.02%, and is in the middle third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3 -year annualized total return of 9.11%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. PREFX's standard deviation over the past three years is 20.92% compared to the category average of 17.93%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 21.29% compared to the category average of 18.22%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsThe fund has a 5-year beta of 1.09, so investors should note that it is hypothetically more volatile than the market at large. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. The fund has produced a negative alpha over the past 5 years of -0.41, which shows that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesHoldingsInvestigating the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology, as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund, the focus is principally on equities that are traded in the United States.Currently, this mutual fund is holding 98.74% in stocks, which have an average market capitalization of $287.02 billion. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:TechnologyRetail TradeWith turnover at about 21.2%, this fund is making fewer trades than the average comparable fund.ExpensesAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, PREFX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.85% compared to the category average of 0.99%. PREFX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.While the minimum initial investment for the product is $2,500, investors should also note that each subsequent investment needs to be at least $100.Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.Bottom LineOverall, T. Rowe Price Tax-Efficient Equity ( PREFX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.For additional information on this product, or to compare it to other mutual funds in the Mutual Fund Equity Report, make sure to go to www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds for additional information.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Discover Financial Services DFS, Builders FirstSource BLDR and Jabil JBL.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Martin Marietta Materials is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that produces and supplies construction aggregates and other heavy building materials, mainly cement, in the United States.The stock is trading just below all-time highs as investors see strong demand helping earnings for the next few years. While it is hard to chase a stock like this higher, investors should be watching for opportunistic pullbacks.About the Company Martin Marietta was founded in 1939 and is headquartered in Raleigh, NC. The company offers crushed stone, sand, and gravel products; ready mixed concrete and asphalt; paving products and services; and Portland and specialty cement for use in infrastructure projects, and nonresidential and residential construction markets, as well as in the railroad, agricultural, utility, and environmental industries.The stock has a Zacks Style Score of ""D"" in Value and Momentum. It has a Forward PE of 28 and pays a small dividend of about half a percent. MLM currently employs 9,400 and has a market cap of $27 billion.Q1 Earnings Beat In early May, the company reported a 118% EPS beat. Q1 earnings came in at $2.16 v the $0.99 expected and revenues were $1.35B v the $1.19B expected. Management cited solid near-term product demand as a reason for the big quarter.The company adjusted its FY23 outlook, seeing EBITDA at the higher end of the expected range. They also lifted their revenue outlook to $6.6-6.82B v the $6.27 expected.Management saw healthy customer backlogs across their footprint which was led by infrastructure and heavy nonresidential project of scale. They expect recent legislation and public investment to support demand for several years.Story continuesThe CEO commented, ""We are confident in our ability to continue to expand margins throughout the year and expect to deliver compelling full-year financial results more directionally in line with the high end of our previously announced 2023 guidance range, which we will revisit at mid-year.""The earnings beat was the second quarter in a row after the company reported multiple misses over the last couple years.Analyst Estimates Looking at analyst estimates since earnings, we see longer-term numbers shooting higher, while short-term looks mixed.Looking at the current quarter, have estimates moving 1% higher over the last 90 days. However, for the next quarter, they are going down by almost 2%. While the magnitude of these moves is low, it tells us that analysts might be conservative in their expectations.This idea is backed up when you look at the bigger picture and see longer-term estimates are going higher over the last 90 days.For the current year, analysts have taken numbers from $14.84 to $15.89, or 7%. For next year, we see estimates jump from $17.04 to $18.14, or 6.5%.The TechnicalsThe stock is trading near 52-week highs, which happen to be all-time highs. Understanding that many investors do not like to chase, let us go over possible areas of support.The stock topped at $462 in late June before pulling back to the $440 area where the 21-day MA has shown some support. Below that level, $417 looks to be the 50-day MA support area, and then $380 is the earnings gap fill.If we get a market sell-off, investors can hope for the 200-day MA at $364, but this is unlikely unless aggressive market selling comes in.For those that look for Fibonacci retracements, the $405 level is the halfway back spot, found drawing from the pre-earnings breakout area to recent highs. The 61.8% retracement is $390.Bottom Line While Martine Marietta has had quite the run, there are both technical and fundamental reasons for this.When a stock trades at all-time highs, there is price discovery above, which is what MLM is going through now.On the fundamental side, strong demand led by public investment will be a tailwind for revenues for years. This will keep investors interested and willing buyers to come in on any sell-off.Those interested in the name should watch support levels for buying opportunities and look for MLM to finish off the year strong.Bear of the Day:Signet Jewelers is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is a retailer of diamond jewelry, watches as well as other products.The stock has rallied nicely with the overall market, but investors might be getting ahead of themselves. A recent earnings report showed the company struggled when compared to last year and Same Store Sales (SSS) were off by double digits. Moreover, the company cut the guidance and estimates are falling.About the Company Signet is headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda.The company operates through three segments: North America, International, and Other.Many familiar brands known in the U.S. are Kay Jewelers, Kay Jewelers Outlet, Jared The Galleria Of Jewelry, Jared Vault, Zales Jewelers, Zales Outlet, Diamonds Direct, James Allen, Banter by Piercing Pagoda, and Peoples Jewellers names, as well as operates online through its digital banners, James Allen and Blue Nile.The company is valued at $3.3B and employs 30,000. The stock has a Forward PE of 7 and pays a dividend of 1.3%. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of ""A"" in Value, but ""F"" in Growth and ""D"" in Momentum.Q1 Earnings In early June, Signet reported an earnings beat of 24%. Beating on the bottom line is what the company does, and it has not missed since 2017. But looking closer, the y/y revenue was down to $1.69B from $1.84B last year.The company cut its FY24 outlook and guided for a weak Q2 citing a deceleration of trends and a softer-than-expected Mother's Day.Q2 revenues are expected to come in at a range of $1.53-1.58B v the expected $1.73B. FY24 is now seen at a range of $9.49-$10.09 v the $11.18 expected. SSS were down 13.9% year over year.The stock's immediate reaction was to go lower, but it bounced above some technical resistance levels. After a more than 10% rally, investors might be getting ahead of themselves as estimates continue to march lower.EstimatesOver the last 60 days, analysts have cut estimates for all time-frames.For the current quarter, analysts have dropped their numbers from $2.65 to $1.34, or 49%.For the next quarter, analysts lowered estimates from $1.02 to $0.75, or 26%.Longer term, numbers are falling as well. Next year's estimates have gone from $12.03 to 10.46 or 13%.Technical TakeThe stock market rally has really helped SIG lift higher. However, investors might be getting ahead of themselves as the stock approaches the upper end of its 52-week range. $75 will be a tough nut to crack and the bears will likely step in.The 200-day MA is around the $69 level and will be watched by both sides. A move back under that level and the recent rally could be considered a failure. Signet investors are familiar with that ""failure"" word as the stock has traded from $150 to $6 back to $110 and down to $50 before the 2023 up move.Expect volatile action that will be amplified with any news on earnings.In SummaryLooking back to the last miss in 2017, the stock was at $60. This was right where it was trading before the recent rally. Meaning that while the stock has seen some big volatile moves, there has been no real appreciation in the name despite all the earnings outperformance.Additional content:3 Red-Hot Stocks Suited for Momentum InvestorsBy targeting stocks breaking out to or near new highs, investors can insert themselves in favorable trends where buyers are in control.And as many have learned, stocks breaking out to new highs tend to make even higher highs, especially when they boast favorable near-term earnings outlooks.Three large-cap stocks –Discover Financial Services, Builders FirstSource and Jabil – are all breaking out to or near 52-week highs and sport a favorable Zacks Rank.In addition, all three carry sound valuation levels, with all carrying a Style Score of ""A"" for Value. For value-conscious investors interested in momentum, let's take a closer look at each.Discover Financial ServicesDiscover Financial Services is a digital banking and payment services company in the United States, offering deposit products, credit cards, and personal, student, and home loans. The stock is a Zack Rank #2 (Buy), with the revisions trend particularly notable for its upcoming quarterly release on July 19th.DFS shares presently trade at an 8.8X forward earnings multiple, in line with the five-year median and nicely beneath 2022 highs of 9.6X. The stock carries a Style Score of ""A"" for Value.Further, DFS shares could also attract income-focused investors, with the company's dividend yielding a solid 2.4% annually. Dividend growth is also apparent, with the payout growing by a double-digit 11% over the last five years.Builders FirstSourceBuilders FirstSource, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), supplies building materials, manufactured components, and construction services to professional homebuilders, sub-contractors, remodelers, and consumers. Analysts have raised their expectations across the board and have been in full agreement.The company has consistently surprised in a big way as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by an average of an impressive 70% over its last four quarters. Market participants have been impressed with the results, with shares seeing bullish activity post-earnings in back-to-back releases.JabilJabil provides electronic manufacturing services and solutions to its customers, currently boasting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The revisions trend for its current fiscal year is hard to ignore, with the $8.50 EPS estimate being revised nearly 8% higher since July of last year.JBL shares currently trade at a 13.1X forward earnings multiple, above the five-year median by a few ticks but nicely below the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average. The company also boasts a solid growth profile, with earnings forecasted to climb 11% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 9% in FY24.Further, Jabil's 45.2% trailing twelve-month return on equity (ROE) is certainly worth highlighting, reflecting a higher level of efficiency in generating profits from existing assets.Bottom LineMomentum investing is centered around targeting stocks displaying outperformance. And when you add in the Zacks Rank, the strategy can become even more powerful.And that's precisely what all three stocks above have displayed, breaking out to new 52-week highs on the back of improved earnings outlooks.In addition, all three sport a Style Score of ""A"" for Value.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

333,516aa2a6-d86f-3937-bd83-a59b09016deb,MLM,2023-07-12,Bull of the Day: Martin Marietta Materials (MLM),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bull-day-martin-marietta-materials-103000084.html,1689157800,STORY,['MLM'],"[Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that produces and supplies construction aggregates and other heavy building materials, mainly cement, in the United States.The stock is trading just below all-time highs as investors see strong demand helping earnings for the next few years. While it is hard to chase a stock like this higher, investors should be watching for opportunistic pullbacks.About the Company Martin Marietta was founded in 1939 and is headquartered in Raleigh, NC. The company offers crushed stone, sand, and gravel products; ready mixed concrete and asphalt; paving products and services; and Portland and specialty cement for use in infrastructure projects, and nonresidential and residential construction markets, as well as in the railroad, agricultural, utility, and environmental industries.The stock has a Zacks Style Score of “D” in Value and Momentum. It has a Forward PE of 28 and pays a small dividend of about half a percent. MLM currently employs 9,400 and has a market cap of $27 billion.Q1 Earnings Beat In early May, the company reported a 118% EPS beat. Q1 earnings came in at $2.16 v the $0.99 expected and revenues were $1.35B v the $1.19B expected. Management cited solid near-term product demand as a reason for the big quarter.The company adjusted its FY23 outlook, seeing EBITDA at the higher end of the expected range. They also lifted their revenue outlook to $6.6-6.82B v the $6.27 expected.Management saw healthy customer backlogs across their footprint which was led by infrastructure and heavy nonresidential project of scale. They expect recent legislation and public investment to support demand for several years.The CEO commented, “We are confident in our ability to continue to expand margins throughout the year and expect to deliver compelling full-year financial results more directionally in line with the high end of our previously announced 2023 guidance range, which we will revisit at mid-year.”Story continuesThe earnings beat was the second quarter in a row after the company reported multiple misses over the last couple years.Analyst Estimates Looking at analyst estimates since earnings, we see longer-term numbers shooting higher, while short-term looks mixed.Looking at the current quarter, have estimates moving 1% higher over the last 90 days. However, for the next quarter, they are going down by almost 2%. While the magnitude of these moves is low, it tells us that analysts might be conservative in their expectations.This idea is backed up when you look at the bigger picture and see longer-term estimates are going higher over the last 90 days.For the current year, analysts have taken numbers from $14.84 to $15.89, or 7%. For next year, we see estimates jump from $17.04 to $18.14, or 6.5%.The TechnicalsThe stock is trading near 52-week highs, which happen to be all-time highs. Understanding that many investors do not like to chase, let us go over possible areas of support.The stock topped at $462 in late June before pulling back to the $440 area where the 21-day MA has shown some support. Below that level, $417 looks to be the 50-day MA support area, and then $380 is the earnings gap fill.If we get a market sell-off, investors can hope for the 200-day MA at $364, but this is unlikely unless aggressive market selling comes in.For those that look for Fibonacci retracements, the $405 level is the halfway back spot, found drawing from the pre-earnings breakout area to recent highs. The 61.8% retracement is $390.Bottom Line While Martine Marietta has had quite the run, there are both technical and fundamental reasons for this.When a stock trades at all-time highs, there is price discovery above, which is what MLM is going through now.On the fundamental side, strong demand led by public investment will be a tailwind for revenues for years. This will keep investors interested and willing buyers to come in on any sell-off.Those interested in the name should watch support levels for buying opportunities and look for MLM to finish off the year strong.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our analysis of the stock market and want to jump to the top five stocks in our list, then take a look at 5 Best Breakout Stocks to Buy Now. The mini week of trading after the July Fourth holiday came with a series of surprises for investors. These were in the form of multiple data releases, all of which covered the state of the labor market. This market is one of the hottest (literally and figuratively) markets right now, since not only is it not refusing to slow down (much to the delight of politicians) but also because the Federal Reserve is watching it like a hawk. Growth in the labor market, especially when it is tight, results in an increase in wages that eventually contribute to inflation. Given that inflation is one of the biggest problems facing the American economy right now, the Federal Reserve is publicly committed to bringing it down through interest rate hikes.The slew of data releases in the first week of July revealed that the private sector added more than twice the number of jobs that economists had predicted. At the same time, unemployment claims for the final week of June also ticked up and the unemployment rate did not fall. Additionally, both the number of job openings and the opening rate declined in May as well, indicating on a whole that perhaps the economy is finally ready to slow down after taking a brutal beating in the form of ten interest rate hikes.Despite high rates and the constant worries of a recession, the stock market has performed remarkably well this year. The star of the show is the NASDAQ 100 index - up by 39.4% during the first half of this year to mark its strongest performance in decades. The index's fortune was boosted by big technology firms and mega cap stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) which have profited from the mania surrounding artificial intelligence. If you're interested in some hot NASDAQ stocks, be sure to check out 15 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Today.Story continuesHowever, the past is past and it's time to look at the future. After all, even as investors took a well earned break after H1, the reality still remains that inflation is high and more potential interest rate hikes might be looming on the horizon. And the latest employment data that we've talked about above is already making its mark on the market. After trading closed on the day the private payrolls data was released, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by a percent and two year Treasury yields jumped to 5.12% - at levels that it had stood in 2007. Investors' fear about more interest rate hikes was mirrored in the Cboe Volatility Index which closed the day to mark an 8.9% jump - which seems paltry considering the fact that it had jumped by a stunning 14.7%, mirroring growth levels that it had reached when bank shares fell earlier this year after the dramatic failure of several high profile banks.All eyes therefore shifted on the payrolls report for June that was due Friday. The private payrolls report set the scene for the upcoming release that will set the tone for the Federal Reserve's next meeting later this month. The central bank will decide whether to increase or keep rates the same, and optimistic investors have been penciling in just one rate hike for July. Officials at the central bank have currently decided to act cautiously, as ten interest rate hikes take their time to work through the economy. However, fears persisted that an unrelenting jobs market might force them to return to the brutal hawkishness displayed in 2023 when stunning 75 basis point hikes were delivered at a time when inflation had crossed 9%.So were investors expecting from the payrolls report that investors are waiting for with bated breaths? Well, Dow Jones consensus estimates believed that the number of jobs will grow by 240,000. The Labor Department's data for May showed that the economy had added 339,000 jobs (revised later to 309,000), and had the estimate held, then the labor market will have slowed down only annually. The May report had seen jobs drop by 51,000, and a reading of 240,000 for June would have implied an annual drop greater than a hundred thousand. Safe to say, the economic situation right now is quite different from a year back, but the key investor irritant is a resistant market that just invites the Federal Reserve to pump up the rates.The data itself was a pleasant surprise that turned around the narrative of the labor market refusing to budge on its head. It revealed that the U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs which ended up significantly undershooting market estimates and falling quite low over the data for May. As a result, major stock indexes including the NASDAQ 100, NASDAQ Composite, the S&amp;P500, and the NYSE Composite all jumped - with the U.S. dollar also tumbling in the currency market.So what to do in a world where markets go one way one day and another the next? Well, perhaps a recent analysis from Morgan Stanley might help, where the investment bank takes a rather gloomy tone:In the current market, we see a few opportunities. In fixed income, consider adding duration by investing in longer-maturity bonds. In equities, we believe that U.S. stock returns are apt to be below average. Investors should diversify using active managers or equal-weighted indices. We continue to see Japanese and emerging-markets stocks, as well as commodities, as good hedges for a peaking U.S. dollar.The bottom line: Investors need to think about the big picture. Don’t try to predict market moves. Instead, work with your Financial Advisor to stay close to your strategic asset allocations, rebalancing as needed.With this backdrop, let's take a look at some stocks that are performing well as part of coverage of the top breakout stocks to buy.

The company’s bullish long-term growth strategy buoys optimism for the stock, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Edwards Lifesciences exited the first quarter of 2023 on a bullish note with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. It also registered year-over-year growth on both fronts. The company’s TMTT segment recorded strong growth, driven by the continued adoption of the PASCAL Precision system in Europe.During the quarter, EW completed the enrollment of the TRISCEND II pivotal trial for the EVOQUE Tricuspid Valve Replacement System. Further, growth within Surgical Structural Heart was lifted by the increased adoption of Edwards' premium products across all regions. The company raised its full-year 2023 guidance, which is encouraging too.Critical Care sales were up 9% on an underlying basis in the first quarter of 2023. Sales growth was led by the Smart Recovery portfolio and the strong adoption of the Acumen IQ sensor and finger cuff featuring a unique Hypotension Prediction Index algorithm.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation PriceEdwards Lifesciences Corporation PriceEdwards Lifesciences Corporation price | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteThe demand for Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheters and the HemoSphere monitoring platform also remained strong in the first quarter, with a healthy pipeline of future opportunities. The company remains excited about its pipeline of Critical Care innovations as it continues to shift its focus to Smart Recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions and get patients home to their families faster.Based on the strong first-quarter performance, Edwards Lifesciences now expects Critical Care full-year 2023 sales in the band of $870-$940 million.Meanwhile, the contraction of both margins in the first quarter is discouraging. In the first quarter, the gross margin contracted 25 basis points (bps) to 77.4%. The company-provided adjusted gross margin was 77.5%, a 30-basis point contraction year over year. This year-over-year reduction was due to a less favorable impact from foreign exchange. During the quarter, operating income fell 2.3% year over year. The operating margin contracted 339 bps to 29.6%.Story continuesWe also remain worried about the significant challenges Edward Lifesciences is facing due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact that has been adversely affecting the company’s profitability.Meanwhile, the medical device industry is highly competitive with the presence of several competent players. In Heart Valve Therapy, Edwards Lifesciences primarily competes with Medtronic and Sorin Group, whereas players, such as ICU Medical, Pulsion Medical Systems AG, LiDCO Group and Becton, Dickinson, offer competition in other segments.In the past year, Edwards Lifesciences has underperformed its industry.

(PRNewsfoto/PPL Electric Utilities)In 2022, PPL Electric became the first U.S. electric utility to integrate DLR technology into real-time and market operations. The technology uses sensors that provide real-time information about conditions such as wind speed and line temperature that affect the performance of transmission lines, which are critical to delivering power to customers. The information from the sensors is used to increase the amount of electricity delivered over transmission lines when needed, decreasing congestion and improving reliability. Since October 2022, PPL Electric has been sending hourly, day-ahead forecasts generated from the DLR system to PJM Interconnection, the regional transmission organization, to help coordinate more efficient generation and ensure reliability.Award-Winning TechnologyPPL Electric's accomplishment hasn't gone unnoticed in the industry. The company was recently recognized by two organizations – Edison Electric Institute (EEI) and Southeastern Electric Exchange (S.E.E.) – for its groundbreaking use of DLR. EEI honored PPL Electric with its 2023 Edison Award, one of the industry's highest honors, which recognizes electric companies for their distinguished leadership, innovation and contribution to the advancement of the electric power industry. Similarly, S.E.E. awarded PPL Electric with an Industry Excellence Award for the transmission line innovation.""We're honored and delighted to receive these significant honors and we're equally proud to be the first electric company in the U.S to use Dynamic Line Rating in this way,"" said PPL Electric Utilities President Steph Raymond. ""This achievement represents our commitment to explore innovative ways of delivering safe, reliable and affordable power to our customers.""Story continuesIndustry-Changing Technology The use of DLR represents a significant industry shift. Historically, utility companies have used static line ratings that are calculated based on set assumptions and the type of power-transmitting conductor that is used on the transmission line. Static ratings don't account for changing environmental factors and assume conservative factors to ensure that conductors don't overheat.While many utilities across the country have installed and piloted DLR sensors and systems, none have previously implemented a full integration with an Energy Management System and fully operated facilities with those ratings in both real-time and market operations.Dynamic Line Rating allows PPL Electric to get more accurate, real-time ratings that allow it to better monitor and manage congestion. The sensors installed on transmission lines capture data that is used to calculate wind speed, ambient temperature and the temperature of conductors.The technology has allowed PPL Electric to eliminate or defer transmission line upgrades and additions, which allows PPL Electric to manage costs and invest money on other projects designed to improve system reliability.""Having real-time measurements allows PPL Electric to optimize performance on transmission lines and make better informed decisions about the need for improvements to those lines,"" said PPL Electric Utilities Director of Asset Management Joe Lookup. ""The end result is lower generation costs and better reliability for customers.""PPL Electric Utilities delivers safe, reliable and affordable electricity to more than 1.4 million homes and businesses in eastern and central Pennsylvania. It regularly ranks among the country's best utility companies for reliability and customer satisfaction.

This month, we’re looking at three opportunities uniquely positioned to leverage current environmental conditions.As heat waves sweep across California, wildfires lurk on the horizon and oil demand surges, these investment vehicles offer opportunities to tap into the energy landscape. From resilience in safeguarding infrastructure against wildfires, robust prospects in the face of bullish oil market trends and broad exposure to the energy sector amidst severe weather events, these are the best energy stocks to buy in July.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEdison International (EIX)Southern California Edison sign and logo EIX stockSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comSouthern California utility company, Edison International (NYSE:EIX), presents a compelling investment opportunity for July in light of the current heatwave conditions throughout the region. Californian weather forecasts indicate prolonged high temperatures and an increased risk of wildfires and heat-related illnesses in July.  The increased demand for reliable utility services due to the heat wave could mean a revenue jump for Edison. Furthermore, the company has reduced the probability of catastrophic wildfires associated with its equipment by about 75%-80% since 2018, demonstrating substantial operational progress in managing wildfire risks. This move shows Edison’s commitment to the community, goodwill and resilience amidst the persisting heatwave conditions. Aside from short-term protection, the company’s newly submitted three-year Wildfire Mitigation Plan will pay dividends down the road. The company strives to strengthen the grid by installing covered conductors and more underground power lines in high-risk areas. This long-term infrastructure focus will serve Edison, California residents and shareholders well over time. Despite its dividends, Edison remains a quality stock for income investors, having consistently performed by increasing its annual dividend yearly since 2004. With a respectable 4.2% trailing yield, EIX is a solid energy stock for investors seeking steady income.Story continuesOccidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comThe current forecast for global oil markets and consumption presents an optimistic outlook for American oil firm Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). OPEC’s recent production cut extension will likely apply upward pressure on crude oil prices. Expect impacts in late 2023 and early 2024, as crude oil forecasts average $79 per barrel and $84, respectively. Furthermore, analysts predict a global fuel consumption rise of 1.6 million daily barrels in 2023 and 1.7 million in 2024. That forecast could be a substantial tailwind for OXY’s operations and profitability.Beyond oil markets, the “Buffett effect” has given OXY an air of investor confidence as Berkshire Hathaway consistently buys company stock whenever prices dip below $60. Warren Buffett’s significant stake of nearly 25% of the company’s shares suggests strong faith in OXY’s future performance. Despite market volatility and relative unpredictability, OXY’s strong foundation and investment backing make it a promising energy stock in July.Energy Selector Sector SPDR Fund (XLE)An image of a battery icon in the center of money; energy storage stocksSource: Blablo101 / ShutterstockSevere heat and weather events throughout the United States are poised to heavily impact energy markets in July.

DVA scaled a new 52-week high of $104.72 on Jul 10, before closing the session slightly lower at $103.69.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 22.7% against the 7.1% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 15.2% growth in the said time frame.Over the past five years, the company registered earnings growth of 12.9% compared with the industry’s 5.9% rise. The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 14.6% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 10.5%. DaVita’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 17.3%.DaVita is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its strength in its DaVita Kidney Care. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and the acquisition of dialysis centers are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding dependence on commercial payers and integration risks persist.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversDaVita Kidney Care: Investors are optimistic about DaVita Kidney Care, the major revenue-generating segment of DVA. It specializes in a broad array of dialysis services, significantly contributing to the company's top line. With respect to DaVita’s Integrated Kidney Care, as of Mar 31, 2023, the company had approximately 67,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements, representing approximately $5.2 billion in annualized medical spend. DaVita also had an additional 15,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements.Acquisition of Dialysis Centers: Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate dialysis centers as well as other ancillary services is DaVita’s preferred business strategy. These strategies have boosted the company’s top line to a large extent, raising investors’ optimism.As of Mar 31, 2023, DaVita provided dialysis services to around 246,000 patients at 3,058 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,707 were U.S. centers while 351 were located across 11 other countries. During the first quarter of 2023, the company opened a total of three new dialysis centers in the United States. It also opened three dialysis centers outside the United States in the same period.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: DaVita’s solid first-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company registered an uptick in its overall top line and both segments during the period. DaVita also recorded an increase in total U.S. dialysis treatments during the quarter.DownsidesDependence on Commercial Payers: A significant portion of DaVita’s dialysis and related lab services’ revenues are generated from patients who have commercial payers as the primary payers. The payments received from commercial payers are the primary generators of profit. However, there remains a risk of people shifting from commercial insurance schemes to government schemes due to the wide disparity in payment rates in case of a rise in unemployment.Integration Risks: DaVita’s business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of dialysis centers and other businesses, as well as entry into joint ventures. The company may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions or expand into new business models, which may affect its operations.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, HealthEquity, Inc. HQY and Boston Scientific Corporation BSX.Hologic, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 5.1% for fiscal 2024.

For more stocks on this list, head on over to 5 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Now.The macroeconomic landscape in the United States, which has been a focal point in headlines and the stock market for over two years, is undergoing a rapid transformation. Just a year ago, investors' primary concerns revolved around interest rates and heightened inflation. However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent commodity shock, along with pandemic-induced stimulatory spending, compelled the Federal Reserve to swiftly increase interest rates. As the market enters the second half of 2023, the Federal Reserve's decisive approach to interest rate hikes is finally bringing about some clarity regarding an economic cooldown.Earlier this June, Fed officials made predictions indicating their intention to raise interest rates twice more within the year, assuming these adjustments would be made in quarter-point increments. However, that does not mean that the Fed must hurt the labor market to achieve policymakers’ goals. In fact, Fed Chair Powell has acknowledged that wages are not necessarily the primary factor driving current inflation. He has noted that wages and inflation often exhibit a correlated relationship, but determining which one is causing the other is challenging to determine.As the July 7 payrolls report approached, traders were preparing for a potentially impactful event. Surprisingly robust data released by the ADP Research Institute a day prior had convinced the market that job growth in the US was still ""too strong"" from the perspective of central bankers cautious about inflation. According to the report, US employers added 209,000 jobs in June, falling short of Wall Street expectations. This led to concerns that the Federal Reserve might implement tighter monetary policy. However, the outcome presented a more nuanced view of the labor market, indicating a moderate slowdown that aligns with the Fed's objectives, albeit at a slower pace than anticipated by some. Investors widely expect the Fed to raise interest rates at their July meeting, and the strength of the labor market could help to shape the outlook after that.Story continuesThese are all developments affecting the market in the short-term. If you are a long-term investor who is looking for forever stocks to buy as we do in our monthly newsletter, you hope that the stock market declines by at least 20% to buy your favorite stocks at a discount. At the end of September 2022, the market provided such an opportunity. We don't think we are going to get another opportunity in the near future and this may be relatively the best time to buy.As the market closed the first half of this year with a positive boost from a reassuring inflation report, the notion of acquiring the best ""forever stocks"" might appear overly cautious. With market sentiment strong and supported by seemingly justifiable factors, investors may lean towards riskier securities with higher potential returns. However, it's important to acknowledge that long-term stock investments hold their own value and significance. With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some potential forever stocks, out of which the top picks include the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), among others listed below.13 Best Forever Stocks to Buy NowOur Methodology""Our favorite holding period is forever."" When it comes to long-term investments, who better to imitate than Wall Street's legendary value investor, Warren Buffett. In order to compile our selection of the best forever stocks, we began by analyzing Buffett's stock portfolio and chose to highlight the stock holdings that have remained within his portfolio for at least 5 years. Next, we assessed the number of hedge fund investors associated with each stock based on Insider Monkey’s survey of 943 funds during the first quarter of this year. Using this information, the stocks were ranked.To be clear the following 13 stocks are the best forever stocks to buy according to billionaire investor and secret hedge fund manager Warren Buffett. We have our own list of favorite forever stocks that we share in our premium newsletter. You should do your own research and decide any of the following stocks fit your definition of forever stocks:13. DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) is a prominent healthcare company specializing in kidney care services. With a significant presence, it ranks among the largest providers of dialysis services in the United States. The company's primary focus lies in treating individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney failure.Lisa Bedell Clive at Bernstein issued an update on May 15, raising the price target on DaVita Inc. (NYSE: DVA) from $88 to $100. This adjustment came in response to the company's improved 2023 guidance, which was announced on May 9.After digging through 943 hedge funds for their March quarter of 2023 investments, Insider Monkey discovered that 32 had bought DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)’s shares. The firm’s second largest investor after Warren Buffett is Jeffrey Gates’ Gates Capital Management, owning one million shares that are worth $84 million.Here is what Moon Capital Management said about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) ranks among the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a decent stock for long-term investments.12. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), commonly known as Kraft Heinz, is an American multinational food company formed by the merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz Company co-headquartered in Chicago and Pittsburgh. The company is involved in making and selling a wide variety of products, including cheese, meals, meats, dairy products, spices, coffee, and others.The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) released its Q1 financial results on May 3, revealing a non-GAAP EPS of $0.68 and revenue of $6.49 billion. These figures exceeded Wall Street estimates by $0.08 and $100 million, respectively. Additionally, the company anticipates a 4% to 6% growth in organic net sales for 2023, as compared to the previous year.Out of the 943 hedge funds included in Insider Monkey's Q1 2023 database, 34 of them held a stake in The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC). First Eagle Investment Management, managed by Jean-Marie Eveillard, emerged as the largest hedge fund investor, with a stake worth $256 million, equivalent to 6.6 million shares. However, the largest overall investor in Kraft Heinz is Warren Buffett, with a massive investment of $12 billion.11. VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Verisign Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) is an American company based in Reston, Virginia, United States, that operates a diverse array of network infrastructure that allows firms to maintain their servers, access domain names, and run security applications. The company ended the first quarter of 2023 with 174.8 million domains in the .com/.net base, which was 1 million more than it ended in the same quarter a year ago.By the end of this year’s first quarter, 37 of the 943 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey’s database had held a stake in the company. Following Warren Buffett, Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)'s largest shareholder, which owns 3.1 million shares that are worth $672 million.10. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), or simply Kroger, is an American retail company that operates supermarkets and multi-department stores throughout the United States. With more than 2,700 supermarkets and multi-department stores spread across 35 states in the United States, The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) ranks as one of the largest food retailers in the world.Earlier this June, UBS lowered the price target on The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) to $48 from $51 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. According to the analysts', sentiment on Kroger remains mixed despite a ""strong"" performance in Q1 as its FY23 outlook remains uncertain. The firm also states that the tone will likely remain mixed until the market gains more confidence in Kroger's intermediate-term outlook and that this will likely leave the stock range-bound for ""the foreseeable future.""Insider Monkey took a look at 943 hedge funds for their first quarter of 2023 investments and found out that 43 had owned The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)’s shares. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns a $2.5 billion stake in the company.Oakmark Funds, advised by Harris Associates, made the following comment about The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption.”9. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO), commonly known as Moody's, is an American business and financial services company. It serves as the parent company for Moody's Investors Service (MIS), an American credit rating agency, and Moody's Analytics (MA), a provider of financial analysis software and services based in the United States.Jeffrey Silber, an analyst at BMO Capital, restated an Outperform rating for Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) stock on May 17, while increasing the target price from $355 to $360. Silber holds the belief that Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) has the potential for a substantial upside of over 16%, considering the closing stock price as of May 18.By the end of Q1 2023, 51 of the 943 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey had bought a stake in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO). A major hedge fund investor is Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management with a $3.17 billion stake.8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Established in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is a prominent American multinational corporation renowned for its production of the iconic Coca-Cola beverage. In addition to its flagship product, the company is involved in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse array of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even some alcoholic beverages within the beverage industry. As one of the largest beverage corporations globally, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) holds a significant position among the long-term investments of renowned value investor Warren Buffett. Buffett, who has maintained a stake in the company since 2010, has famously expressed his unwavering commitment to retain his shares in the company.On June 6, HSBC analyst Carlos Laboy lowered the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $74 from $77 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst views Coca-Cola as a much better defensive stock in inflationary times than in the past. However, his near term concern for beverage giant remains the ongoing tax litigation, which it says could cost the company up to 14 billion in payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”7. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73General Motors, formally the General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), is an American multinational automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, United States.During the initial quarter of 2023, the company experienced an impressive 11.1% growth in revenue compared to the previous year, reaching nearly $40 billion. Additionally, the automotive operating cash flow for the quarter rose to $2.3 billion, showcasing a significant increase from $1.6 billion in the same period of the previous year.Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) from an Equal Weight rating to an Overweight rating on May 1. Additionally, the analyst increased the price target on the stock from $35 to $38. Recognizing General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) as one of the leading companies in the auto sector, Jones included it in his list of the ""top 5"" automotive companies.According to Insider Monkey’s Q1 2023 database, 73 hedge funds disclosed long positions in General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), worth roughly $4 billion. Of these, investment firm Harris Associates holds a significant position as a shareholder.6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American multinational consumer goods corporation headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. The company provides branded consumer packaged goods worldwide, operating through Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segments.On April 11, the company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.9407 per share, marking a 3% increase. With this raise, the company extended its impressive streak of dividend growth to 67 years, solidifying its position as not only one of the top dividend aristocrat stocks on our list, but also one of the best forever stock.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), compared to 74 funds in the preceding quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.94 million shares valued at $735.2 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”Much like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a top 'forever' stock finding favor with hedge funds.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Now.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Honeywell International Inc. HON, Humana Inc.'s HUM, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. KDP, NextEra Energy Inc. NEE and The Coca-Cola Co. KO.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Buy 5 Underperformers of 1H23 That Are Set to RollWall Street had an impressive first half 2023 after a disappointing 2022. Major stock indexes achieved several milestones during this period. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite exited the bear market and formed a new bull market in first-half 2023. The S&amp;P 500 recorded its best half in four years while the Nasdaq Composite posted its best first-half in 40 years.Consequently, most of the stocks surged during this period. This was a reversal from 2022, when most of the U.S. stocks plummeted as the pandemic-era fiscal incentives were withdrawn and the Fed pursued tight monetary control with rigorous increases in the benchmark interest rate.As a result, Wall Street started 2023 with an overall undervaluation of equity markets. The steady decline in the inflation rate from its peak in June 2022 and the Fed's reduction of the magnitude of interest rate hike also favored U.S. stock markets.However, several stocks did not participate in the dream rally of first-half 2023. Many of these stocks are set to roll in the second half. At this stage, it should be prudent to invest in such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate bigwigs (market capital &gt;$40 billion) with negative returns in stock prices in the first half of 2023. These stocks have strong potential for the rest of 2023. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesHoneywell International Inc. is benefiting from recovery in commercial flight hours and strength in advanced materials and UOP businesses.

Strategic buyouts and alliances place HUM well for growth in the future. HUM's revenues for 2023 are expected within $104.4-$106.4 billion.Solid contributions from the Insurance and CenterWell segments bode well for HUM.

356,62818b01-58eb-3e97-abfa-82a3a57fb86f,INCY,2023-07-12,Incyte Announces Positive Topline Results from Phase 3 Trial Evaluating Ruxolitinib Cream (Opzelura®) in Children with Atopic Dermatitis,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/incyte-announces-positive-topline-results-200500335.html,1689105900,STORY,['INCY'],"[Phase 3 TruE-AD3 Study met its primary endpointWILMINGTON, Del., July 11, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Incyte (Nasdaq:INCY) today announced positive topline results from its randomized, vehicle-controlled, pivotal Phase 3 TRuE-AD3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib cream (Opzelura®) in children (age ≥2 to &lt;12 years) with atopic dermatitis (AD).The study met its primary endpoint and showed significantly more patients treated with ruxolitinib cream 0.75% and 1.5% achieved Investigator’s Global Assessment Treatment Success (IGA-TS) than patients treated with vehicle control (non-medicated cream). Investigator’s Global Assessment Treatment Success (IGA-TS) is defined as an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with at least a two-point improvement from baseline at Week 8. The overall safety profile of ruxolitinib cream is consistent with previous data, and no new safety signals were observed. The long-term safety portion of the study will continue as planned.""AD is a chronic, immune-mediated skin condition that affects about 13% of all children in the U.S. It can cause disruptive symptoms like redness, dry skin and intense itch, which can detrimentally impact quality of life and be difficult to manage for both the child and their caregivers,"" said Jim Lee, M.D., Group Vice President, Inflammation &amp; AutoImmunity, Incyte. ""We have already seen the benefit that ruxolitinib cream can have among adult and adolescent patients with atopic dermatitis in the TRuE-AD1 and TRuE-AD2 studies, and this new positive data reinforces the potential of ruxolitinib cream to offer children a much-needed effective, non-steroidal topical therapy. We look forward to discussing these data with regulatory agencies to determine next steps.""Data from TRuE-AD3 will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific meeting.AD – the most common type of eczema – is a chronic skin disease, which in the U.S. affects an estimated 2-3 million patients ages 2-11 and more than 21 million people 12 years and older1,2. It is characterized by inflammation and itch. Signs and symptoms include irritated and itchy skin that can cause red lesions that may ooze and crust. People with AD are also more susceptible to bacterial, viral and fungal infections3.Story continuesAbout TRuE-AD3TRuE-AD3 (NCT04921969) is a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib cream compared to vehicle (non-medicated cream) in children with atopic dermatitis (AD). The study enrolled over 300 patients (age ≥2 to &lt;12 years) diagnosed with AD for at least 3 months and who were candidates for topical therapy.Patients with an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 2 to 3 (a measure of disease severity), and with AD on 3% to 20% of their Body Surface Area (BSA; excluding scalp) were randomized 2:2:1 to receive ruxolitinib cream 0.75% administered twice daily (BID); ruxolitinib cream 1.5% BID; or vehicle (non-medicated cream) BID. Participants who successfully completed an efficacy assessment at Week 8 were offered participation in the 44-week long-term safety treatment extension period with their same treatment group (ruxolitinib cream 0.75% or 1.5% BID). Participants initially randomized to vehicle cream were re-randomized (1:1) in a blinded manner to one of the active treatment group.The primary endpoint of TRuE-AD3 is the proportion of participants achieving an Investigator’s Global Assessment Treatment Success (IGA-TS), defined as an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with at least a 2-point improvement from baseline at Week 8. Secondary endpoints include: the proportion of patients achieving at least a 75% improvement from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) score – another measurement of disease extent and severity – and the proportion of participants with at least a 4-point improvement in the itch numerical rating scale (NRS). The study is also tracking the frequency, duration and severity of adverse events associated with the use of ruxolitinib cream.For more information about the study, please visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04921969.About Opzelura® (ruxolitinib) Cream 1.5%Opzelura, a novel cream formulation of Incyte’s selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, approved by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in patients 12 years of age and older, is the first and only treatment for repigmentation approved for use in the United States.

If you want to skip our analysis of the stock market and want to jump to the top five stocks in our list, then take a look at 5 Best Breakout Stocks to Buy Now. The mini week of trading after the July Fourth holiday came with a series of surprises for investors. These were in the form of multiple data releases, all of which covered the state of the labor market. This market is one of the hottest (literally and figuratively) markets right now, since not only is it not refusing to slow down (much to the delight of politicians) but also because the Federal Reserve is watching it like a hawk. Growth in the labor market, especially when it is tight, results in an increase in wages that eventually contribute to inflation. Given that inflation is one of the biggest problems facing the American economy right now, the Federal Reserve is publicly committed to bringing it down through interest rate hikes.The slew of data releases in the first week of July revealed that the private sector added more than twice the number of jobs that economists had predicted. At the same time, unemployment claims for the final week of June also ticked up and the unemployment rate did not fall. Additionally, both the number of job openings and the opening rate declined in May as well, indicating on a whole that perhaps the economy is finally ready to slow down after taking a brutal beating in the form of ten interest rate hikes.Despite high rates and the constant worries of a recession, the stock market has performed remarkably well this year. The star of the show is the NASDAQ 100 index - up by 39.4% during the first half of this year to mark its strongest performance in decades. The index's fortune was boosted by big technology firms and mega cap stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) which have profited from the mania surrounding artificial intelligence.

After all, even as investors took a well earned break after H1, the reality still remains that inflation is high and more potential interest rate hikes might be looming on the horizon. And the latest employment data that we've talked about above is already making its mark on the market. After trading closed on the day the private payrolls data was released, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by a percent and two year Treasury yields jumped to 5.12% - at levels that it had stood in 2007. Investors' fear about more interest rate hikes was mirrored in the Cboe Volatility Index which closed the day to mark an 8.9% jump - which seems paltry considering the fact that it had jumped by a stunning 14.7%, mirroring growth levels that it had reached when bank shares fell earlier this year after the dramatic failure of several high profile banks.All eyes therefore shifted on the payrolls report for June that was due Friday. The private payrolls report set the scene for the upcoming release that will set the tone for the Federal Reserve's next meeting later this month. The central bank will decide whether to increase or keep rates the same, and optimistic investors have been penciling in just one rate hike for July. Officials at the central bank have currently decided to act cautiously, as ten interest rate hikes take their time to work through the economy. However, fears persisted that an unrelenting jobs market might force them to return to the brutal hawkishness displayed in 2023 when stunning 75 basis point hikes were delivered at a time when inflation had crossed 9%.So were investors expecting from the payrolls report that investors are waiting for with bated breaths? Well, Dow Jones consensus estimates believed that the number of jobs will grow by 240,000. The Labor Department's data for May showed that the economy had added 339,000 jobs (revised later to 309,000), and had the estimate held, then the labor market will have slowed down only annually. The May report had seen jobs drop by 51,000, and a reading of 240,000 for June would have implied an annual drop greater than a hundred thousand. Safe to say, the economic situation right now is quite different from a year back, but the key investor irritant is a resistant market that just invites the Federal Reserve to pump up the rates.The data itself was a pleasant surprise that turned around the narrative of the labor market refusing to budge on its head. It revealed that the U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs which ended up significantly undershooting market estimates and falling quite low over the data for May. As a result, major stock indexes including the NASDAQ 100, NASDAQ Composite, the S&amp;P500, and the NYSE Composite all jumped - with the U.S. dollar also tumbling in the currency market.So what to do in a world where markets go one way one day and another the next? Well, perhaps a recent analysis from Morgan Stanley might help, where the investment bank takes a rather gloomy tone:In the current market, we see a few opportunities. In fixed income, consider adding duration by investing in longer-maturity bonds. In equities, we believe that U.S. stock returns are apt to be below average. Investors should diversify using active managers or equal-weighted indices. We continue to see Japanese and emerging-markets stocks, as well as commodities, as good hedges for a peaking U.S. dollar.The bottom line: Investors need to think about the big picture. Don’t try to predict market moves. Instead, work with your Financial Advisor to stay close to your strategic asset allocations, rebalancing as needed.With this backdrop, let's take a look at some stocks that are performing well as part of coverage of the top breakout stocks to buy.

To skip our detailed analysis of current developments in the generative AI space, you can go directly to see the 5 Generative AI Stocks To Watch Amidst Copyright Concerns.The discourse surrounding generative AI has pervaded the investment community since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. Between then and now, generative AI has managed to stick around as a hot topic that every tech and AI enthusiast is interested in. As more people talked about it, the demand for generative AI products and software began to skyrocket, resulting in many tech companies jumping into the new craze in an attempt to offer their customers the best product in this space. As such, these companies have now become the leaders in this space and have continued to benefit from it throughout 2023. However, recent events show that the generative AI frenzy may go through a downturn after all this time.Copyright Issues: An Early RiskOn July 10, CNBC reported that Hollywood writers and content creators have issued a hue and cry against major generative AI companies, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and OpenAi, in particular. Their claim is that these companies have been involved in copyright infringement by using their content without permission to train their AI chatbots. Comedian Sarah Silverman, along with several other Hollywood writers, have announced that they are in the process of suing OpenAI and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) over this alleged copyright infringement. According to the report, this may be only the beginning of copyright infringement lawsuits leveled against not just these companies but other companies that are involved in this space as well.Such developments may very well impact the future of other companies in this space as well, like Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), two Chinese companies that have recently launched their own generative AI chatbots: the Ernie bot and Tongyi Qianwen, respectively. The investing community is thus keeping a close watch on further developments in this matter, with RBC analysts putting out the following statement:Story continues""We're also keeping our antenna up for data points like these representing downside risk relative to the current level of generative AI hype.""How Big of A Threat Is This?Despite these looming lawsuits and the possibility of more coming up in the future, several professionals see generative AI as something that is bound to continue succeeding in this market. In an interview with CNBC on July 6, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy said the following:""To me, I see generative AI as one of the biggest technical transformations in our lifetime, and I think it has the ability to transform virtually every customer experience that we know.""In another CNBC interview from the next day, Paul Meeks, Independent Solutions Wealth Management portfolio manager, also chipped in on this subject: Here's what he said about the AI arms race:""We're in a hype cycle and all of the tech majors, including Amazon, will get to the substance before too long. Tech companies will distinguish themselves not by having AI - that'll be everybody's oxygen - but by the companies that actually don't jump on this bandwagon.""Meeks went on to compare the AI hype cycle with the 1990s dot-com bubble, stating that the main companies involved in that trend managed to exploit it and benefit, while other companies that didn't manage to follow in their footsteps ceased to exist. Meeks expects a similar form of fallout during the AI hype cycle moving forward.Considering the above opinions put forth by professionals in the field, the case that generative AI may struggle in the face of challenges, like the current copyright infringement issue, may not be as strong. However, financial professionals are still opting to keep their eyes and ears open to spot any downsides to the generative AI hype cycle. In light of this, we have compiled a list of generative AI stocks to watch at this moment.10 Generative AI Stocks To Watch Amidst Copyright Concerns Photo by Levart_Photographer on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have selected stocks that are involved in the generative AI space through either their own software or chatbots or even other technology that is vitally supporting generative AI applications in different companies.

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 220Upside Potential: 3.44%Average Analyst Price Target: $304.21Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a communication services company based in Menlo Park, California. It has joined the generative AI space with its LLaMA model, a Large Language Model (LLM).The stock should be watched closely in light of the looming copyright infringement lawsuit being filed against Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META) during the first quarter, with a total stake value of $25.1 billion.Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett maintains a Buy rating on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) shares as of July 7.

(NASDAQ:META) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Delivering performance through fundamental, bottom-up stock selection has been a constant over our tenure managing the Strategy. We underperformed in the first half of 2022 from being too early in entering several stocks going through negative earnings revisions and have seen relative results rebound over the last 12 months due to better stock picking, especially among earnings reset names such as Netflix and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Also within shadow tech, we added back to our weighting in Meta as steady advertising trends and continued cost management should lead to improved profitability.”9. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 289Upside Potential: 5.56%Average Analyst Price Target: $350.29Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was spotted in the 13F holdings of 289 hedge funds during the first quarter, with a total stake value of $57.9 billion.As of July 6, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss holds an Overweight rating on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares. Weiss also raised his price target on the stock from $335 to $415.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a large informational technology company based in Redmond, Washington.The company's investment ties to OpenAI and its own foray into the generative AI space with the Bing chatbot may leave it vulnerable in light of the recent lawsuit being filed against OpenAI and concerns of copyright infringement surrounding generative AI in particular.ARK Investment Management was the largest shareholder in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) at the end of the first quarter, holding 58,969 shares in the company.This is what ClearBridge Investments had to say about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“2023 has so far marked a return to mega cap leadership, with Apple, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet, Amazon.com and Nvidia accounting for approximately two thirds of the benchmark return. At 41.3%, the five largest stocks in the market represent the highest concentration in the 26-year history of the Russell 1000 Growth Index. Among these names, we maintain overweights to Nvidia (+246 bps) and Amazon (+117 bps), underweights to Microsoft (-353 bps) and Apple.The Strategy’s IT holdings also drove performance in the second quarter, led by the continued rerating of graphics chipmaker Nvidia as a key beneficiary of the generative AI boom. AI-connected holdings Microsoft and Amazon also delivered strong gains.”Like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a generative AI stock to keep a close eye on in while the OpenAI and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) lawsuits progress.8. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 155Upside Potential: 8.35%Average Analyst Price Target: $126.63Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), another big tech company on our list, is holding its own in the generative AI space with LaMDA, which laid the groundwork for its ChatGPT rival chatbot, Bard. The company is based in Mountain View, California.Our hedge fund data shows 155 funds long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $18.6 billion.Justin Post at BofA holds a Buy rating on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares as of June 15, alongside a $128 price target.Manole Capital Management made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Despite this, the S&amp;P 500 is up 7% this year and the Nasdaq is up +11%. Technology rebounded from a challenging 2022 and many large tech companies are performing quite well this year. Through mid-May 2023, year-to-date performance of some of the most popular and largest names tech names is impressive. For tech companies with market capitalizations over $1 trillion, Apple is up +35%, Microsoft +33%, Amazon +39%, and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is +40%. If you add in Nvdia, Google and Meta, you have three quarters of the entire S&amp;P 500’s year-to-date return.For our purposes, we are just going to focus on software digital wallets, as they are much more common and accessible. If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay pre-loaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use. Those two, along with Google Pay and PayPal, are the four most popular digital wallets today. According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%.We are loyal Apple users (iPhones, iPads, iMac) and find their Apple Pay to be a convenient and safe digital wallet to use. It is currently accepted at more than 90% of US retailers, so it clearly has widespread adoption. Samsung and Google users also seem pleased with their preferred digital wallets. In our opinion, these new entrants are “a bit too late to the party” to make a meaningful dent versus established players.As of today, both Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay have a distinct advantage in the digital wallet arena. These three firms have spent billions of dollars ensuring that their apps are easy to use on their smartphones. Plus, and maybe more importantly, the consumer experience is embedded and native to the operating system. This ties their digital wallet to the device, which cannot be replicated.”7. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Upside Potential: 9.39%Average Analyst Price Target: $542.94Holding 1.9 million shares in the company, Citadel Investment Group was the most significant stakeholder in Adobe Inc.

It is based in San Jose, California.The company's links to generative AI lay with Firefly, which is Adobe Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ADBE) family of creative generative AI models. Its involvement in generative AI may leave the company vulnerable to allegations similar to those being leveled against OpenAI.On June 21, Keith Bachman at BMO Capital upgraded shares of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) from Market Perform to Outperform and announced a price target of $570 on the stock.Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was found in the portfolios of 99 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $7.3 billion.Here's what ClearBridge Investments had to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“We increased our position in marketing and design software maker Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). The company is protecting its leadership position by moving quickly into generative AI and license protection. It developed Firefly into a product that can be monetized, moving AI from a previously perceived risk into an opportunity.”Like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a generative AI stock to watch in light of copyright issues.6. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86Upside Potential: 9.55%Average Analyst Price Target: $508.67Mizuho analyst Siti Panigrahi reiterated a Buy rating on Intuit Inc.

We see a clear path to upside earnings revisions as the company expands new products that increase its total addressable market and drive average revenue per user growth.”Click to continue reading and see the 5 Generative AI Stocks To Watch Amidst Copyright Concerns.Suggested articles:10 Stocks Jumping On The Generative AI WagonTop 10 Generative Artificial Intelligence Companies to Invest In15 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 10 Generative AI Stocks To Watch Amidst Copyright Concerns is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

F.L.Putnam Chief Market Strategist Ellen Hazen joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss her stock winners and losers, as well as the health of the consumer.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Well, markets do seem to be off to a good start this summer. But with recession talk looming, investors are looking for the best ways to protect their investments. Our next guest joins us with some stock picks to help spruce up your portfolio. Ellen Hazen is with us-- chief market strategist and portfolio manager at FL Putnam Investment Management. Ellen, it's good to see you as always. And so we are coming off of sort of an unexpectedly strong start for the year here. As we take a breath going into the second half of the year, how are you sort of thinking about what the setup looks like?ELLEN HAZEN: So we're looking for estimates to be probably flat for the rest of 2023 where they are right now. Six, nine months ago we were looking at estimates that we thought were far too high for 2023. And right now, consensus has the full year at about down 2%, and we think that's probably about right.The economy is continuing to slow. But what you want to own in a decelerating economy are stocks that are pretty inexpensive, that have a cushion beneath them so that if they disappoint the valuations are not too demanding. And what we want to be doing is cutting back on those companies that have really high multiples.BRAD SMITH: What are the most cushiony, inexpensive stocks right now Helen-- Ellen?ELLEN HAZEN: So one example is Chubb. We've been buying Chubb recently. That's an insurance company. You think, wow, insurance, that's pretty boring. But it's trading at under 10 times earnings. They're still growing earnings at 10% to 12%, and it's trading at a 10-year low in terms of forward PE multiple.So that's a stock that I think you can add to. You could buy it today. And is it going to be the next Tesla? No, it's not going to be the next Tesla. But it's very Steady Eddie, it has a nice dividend yield, and it can provide a cushion in an environment where we see decelerating economic fundamentals, decelerating GDP. And therefore, I don't know how much earnings estimates are going to increase from here.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: You know, one stock maybe you don't think is so cushiony-- and we're showing here some of your recent portfolio activity. You exited-- exited Target. That one really caught my eye, Ellen, because here we are. Amazon Prime Days, right? We're going into the back-to-school season, et cetera. Why are you getting out of Target here?ELLEN HAZEN: Target was a great company and a great stock for a long time. And I think it's still a great company, but I don't know if it's going to be a good stock from here on in. If you look at the overall economic backdrop and diving into specific sectors as well, what you see is that services are doing really well across the board and goods are really struggling.You see that, for example, in the airline numbers that you quoted just a few minutes ago. We've seen the airline stocks do really well year to date. Airlines have pricing power. That's a service. People are going on revenge travel. You see it in the PMIs. If you look at the services PMI, it's still well above 50, and so that's showing an expanding economy as people are diverting their money towards services.But if you look at manufacturing PMI, that continues to struggle. And similarly, a lot of retailers that are dependent on goods-- selling goods, like Target but others as well, we think they're going to continue to struggle as the consumer is spending that saved up COVID savings-- that excess household balance sheet, they're spending that on services. And so even though Target's a pretty inexpensive stock and it is a great company-- I want to own it again at the right price-- I think as we look at the next three, six, nine months, it's harder to see what the catalyst is going to be for those goods part of the economy to reaccelerate.BRAD SMITH: If the consumer truly is as resilient as some of the guests we've spoken to are anticipating executives to talk about this earnings season, which of those companies would that show up for in their own reports, their own financial statements?ELLEN HAZEN: Well, one of the first things that I look at to gauge the health of the consumer is the credit card companies and whether or not we are seeing deterioration in delinquencies and defaults. And we're really not seeing it. We are a little bit at the lowest income quintile of households, and so we are seeing a little bit of credit stress there. But we're not seeing it in the main line credit card numbers.And so that's really where you're going to see the stresses first because people are going to fall behind on their credit card payments. And so we're not seeing it yet. But having said that, we have had very, very low delinquencies for years now, so it's probably just a matter of time until that begins to deteriorate.]"

For more stocks on this list, head on over to 5 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Now.The macroeconomic landscape in the United States, which has been a focal point in headlines and the stock market for over two years, is undergoing a rapid transformation. Just a year ago, investors' primary concerns revolved around interest rates and heightened inflation. However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent commodity shock, along with pandemic-induced stimulatory spending, compelled the Federal Reserve to swiftly increase interest rates. As the market enters the second half of 2023, the Federal Reserve's decisive approach to interest rate hikes is finally bringing about some clarity regarding an economic cooldown.Earlier this June, Fed officials made predictions indicating their intention to raise interest rates twice more within the year, assuming these adjustments would be made in quarter-point increments. However, that does not mean that the Fed must hurt the labor market to achieve policymakers’ goals. In fact, Fed Chair Powell has acknowledged that wages are not necessarily the primary factor driving current inflation. He has noted that wages and inflation often exhibit a correlated relationship, but determining which one is causing the other is challenging to determine.As the July 7 payrolls report approached, traders were preparing for a potentially impactful event. Surprisingly robust data released by the ADP Research Institute a day prior had convinced the market that job growth in the US was still ""too strong"" from the perspective of central bankers cautious about inflation. According to the report, US employers added 209,000 jobs in June, falling short of Wall Street expectations. This led to concerns that the Federal Reserve might implement tighter monetary policy. However, the outcome presented a more nuanced view of the labor market, indicating a moderate slowdown that aligns with the Fed's objectives, albeit at a slower pace than anticipated by some. Investors widely expect the Fed to raise interest rates at their July meeting, and the strength of the labor market could help to shape the outlook after that.Story continuesThese are all developments affecting the market in the short-term. If you are a long-term investor who is looking for forever stocks to buy as we do in our monthly newsletter, you hope that the stock market declines by at least 20% to buy your favorite stocks at a discount. At the end of September 2022, the market provided such an opportunity. We don't think we are going to get another opportunity in the near future and this may be relatively the best time to buy.As the market closed the first half of this year with a positive boost from a reassuring inflation report, the notion of acquiring the best ""forever stocks"" might appear overly cautious. With market sentiment strong and supported by seemingly justifiable factors, investors may lean towards riskier securities with higher potential returns. However, it's important to acknowledge that long-term stock investments hold their own value and significance. With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some potential forever stocks, out of which the top picks include the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc.

When it comes to long-term investments, who better to imitate than Wall Street's legendary value investor, Warren Buffett. In order to compile our selection of the best forever stocks, we began by analyzing Buffett's stock portfolio and chose to highlight the stock holdings that have remained within his portfolio for at least 5 years. Next, we assessed the number of hedge fund investors associated with each stock based on Insider Monkey’s survey of 943 funds during the first quarter of this year. Using this information, the stocks were ranked.To be clear the following 13 stocks are the best forever stocks to buy according to billionaire investor and secret hedge fund manager Warren Buffett. We have our own list of favorite forever stocks that we share in our premium newsletter. You should do your own research and decide any of the following stocks fit your definition of forever stocks:13. DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) is a prominent healthcare company specializing in kidney care services. With a significant presence, it ranks among the largest providers of dialysis services in the United States. The company's primary focus lies in treating individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney failure.Lisa Bedell Clive at Bernstein issued an update on May 15, raising the price target on DaVita Inc. (NYSE: DVA) from $88 to $100. This adjustment came in response to the company's improved 2023 guidance, which was announced on May 9.After digging through 943 hedge funds for their March quarter of 2023 investments, Insider Monkey discovered that 32 had bought DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)’s shares. The firm’s second largest investor after Warren Buffett is Jeffrey Gates’ Gates Capital Management, owning one million shares that are worth $84 million.Here is what Moon Capital Management said about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) ranks among the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a decent stock for long-term investments.12.

The company is involved in making and selling a wide variety of products, including cheese, meals, meats, dairy products, spices, coffee, and others.The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) released its Q1 financial results on May 3, revealing a non-GAAP EPS of $0.68 and revenue of $6.49 billion. These figures exceeded Wall Street estimates by $0.08 and $100 million, respectively. Additionally, the company anticipates a 4% to 6% growth in organic net sales for 2023, as compared to the previous year.Out of the 943 hedge funds included in Insider Monkey's Q1 2023 database, 34 of them held a stake in The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC). First Eagle Investment Management, managed by Jean-Marie Eveillard, emerged as the largest hedge fund investor, with a stake worth $256 million, equivalent to 6.6 million shares. However, the largest overall investor in Kraft Heinz is Warren Buffett, with a massive investment of $12 billion.11. VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Verisign Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) is an American company based in Reston, Virginia, United States, that operates a diverse array of network infrastructure that allows firms to maintain their servers, access domain names, and run security applications. The company ended the first quarter of 2023 with 174.8 million domains in the .com/.net base, which was 1 million more than it ended in the same quarter a year ago.By the end of this year’s first quarter, 37 of the 943 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey’s database had held a stake in the company. Following Warren Buffett, Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)'s largest shareholder, which owns 3.1 million shares that are worth $672 million.10. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), or simply Kroger, is an American retail company that operates supermarkets and multi-department stores throughout the United States. With more than 2,700 supermarkets and multi-department stores spread across 35 states in the United States, The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) ranks as one of the largest food retailers in the world.Earlier this June, UBS lowered the price target on The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) to $48 from $51 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. According to the analysts', sentiment on Kroger remains mixed despite a ""strong"" performance in Q1 as its FY23 outlook remains uncertain. The firm also states that the tone will likely remain mixed until the market gains more confidence in Kroger's intermediate-term outlook and that this will likely leave the stock range-bound for ""the foreseeable future.""Insider Monkey took a look at 943 hedge funds for their first quarter of 2023 investments and found out that 43 had owned The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)’s shares. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns a $2.5 billion stake in the company.Oakmark Funds, advised by Harris Associates, made the following comment about The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption.”9. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO), commonly known as Moody's, is an American business and financial services company. It serves as the parent company for Moody's Investors Service (MIS), an American credit rating agency, and Moody's Analytics (MA), a provider of financial analysis software and services based in the United States.Jeffrey Silber, an analyst at BMO Capital, restated an Outperform rating for Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) stock on May 17, while increasing the target price from $355 to $360.

A major hedge fund investor is Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management with a $3.17 billion stake.8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Established in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is a prominent American multinational corporation renowned for its production of the iconic Coca-Cola beverage. In addition to its flagship product, the company is involved in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse array of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even some alcoholic beverages within the beverage industry. As one of the largest beverage corporations globally, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) holds a significant position among the long-term investments of renowned value investor Warren Buffett. Buffett, who has maintained a stake in the company since 2010, has famously expressed his unwavering commitment to retain his shares in the company.On June 6, HSBC analyst Carlos Laboy lowered the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $74 from $77 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst views Coca-Cola as a much better defensive stock in inflationary times than in the past. However, his near term concern for beverage giant remains the ongoing tax litigation, which it says could cost the company up to 14 billion in payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”7. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73General Motors, formally the General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), is an American multinational automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, United States.During the initial quarter of 2023, the company experienced an impressive 11.1% growth in revenue compared to the previous year, reaching nearly $40 billion.

Additionally, the analyst increased the price target on the stock from $35 to $38. Recognizing General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) as one of the leading companies in the auto sector, Jones included it in his list of the ""top 5"" automotive companies.According to Insider Monkey’s Q1 2023 database, 73 hedge funds disclosed long positions in General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), worth roughly $4 billion. Of these, investment firm Harris Associates holds a significant position as a shareholder.6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American multinational consumer goods corporation headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. The company provides branded consumer packaged goods worldwide, operating through Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segments.On April 11, the company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.9407 per share, marking a 3% increase. With this raise, the company extended its impressive streak of dividend growth to 67 years, solidifying its position as not only one of the top dividend aristocrat stocks on our list, but also one of the best forever stock.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), compared to 74 funds in the preceding quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.94 million shares valued at $735.2 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”Much like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a top 'forever' stock finding favor with hedge funds.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Now.

DVA scaled a new 52-week high of $104.72 on Jul 10, before closing the session slightly lower at $103.69.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 22.7% against the 7.1% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 15.2% growth in the said time frame.Over the past five years, the company registered earnings growth of 12.9% compared with the industry’s 5.9% rise. The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 14.6% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 10.5%. DaVita’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 17.3%.DaVita is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its strength in its DaVita Kidney Care. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and the acquisition of dialysis centers are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding dependence on commercial payers and integration risks persist.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversDaVita Kidney Care: Investors are optimistic about DaVita Kidney Care, the major revenue-generating segment of DVA. It specializes in a broad array of dialysis services, significantly contributing to the company's top line. With respect to DaVita’s Integrated Kidney Care, as of Mar 31, 2023, the company had approximately 67,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements, representing approximately $5.2 billion in annualized medical spend. DaVita also had an additional 15,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements.Acquisition of Dialysis Centers: Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate dialysis centers as well as other ancillary services is DaVita’s preferred business strategy. These strategies have boosted the company’s top line to a large extent, raising investors’ optimism.As of Mar 31, 2023, DaVita provided dialysis services to around 246,000 patients at 3,058 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,707 were U.S. centers while 351 were located across 11 other countries. During the first quarter of 2023, the company opened a total of three new dialysis centers in the United States. It also opened three dialysis centers outside the United States in the same period.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: DaVita’s solid first-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company registered an uptick in its overall top line and both segments during the period. DaVita also recorded an increase in total U.S. dialysis treatments during the quarter.DownsidesDependence on Commercial Payers: A significant portion of DaVita’s dialysis and related lab services’ revenues are generated from patients who have commercial payers as the primary payers. The payments received from commercial payers are the primary generators of profit. However, there remains a risk of people shifting from commercial insurance schemes to government schemes due to the wide disparity in payment rates in case of a rise in unemployment.Integration Risks: DaVita’s business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of dialysis centers and other businesses, as well as entry into joint ventures. The company may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions or expand into new business models, which may affect its operations.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption.”9. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO), commonly known as Moody's, is an American business and financial services company. It serves as the parent company for Moody's Investors Service (MIS), an American credit rating agency, and Moody's Analytics (MA), a provider of financial analysis software and services based in the United States.Jeffrey Silber, an analyst at BMO Capital, restated an Outperform rating for Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) stock on May 17, while increasing the target price from $355 to $360. Silber holds the belief that Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) has the potential for a substantial upside of over 16%, considering the closing stock price as of May 18.By the end of Q1 2023, 51 of the 943 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey had bought a stake in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO). A major hedge fund investor is Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management with a $3.17 billion stake.8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Established in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is a prominent American multinational corporation renowned for its production of the iconic Coca-Cola beverage. In addition to its flagship product, the company is involved in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse array of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even some alcoholic beverages within the beverage industry. As one of the largest beverage corporations globally, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) holds a significant position among the long-term investments of renowned value investor Warren Buffett. Buffett, who has maintained a stake in the company since 2010, has famously expressed his unwavering commitment to retain his shares in the company.On June 6, HSBC analyst Carlos Laboy lowered the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $74 from $77 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst views Coca-Cola as a much better defensive stock in inflationary times than in the past. However, his near term concern for beverage giant remains the ongoing tax litigation, which it says could cost the company up to 14 billion in payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”7. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73General Motors, formally the General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), is an American multinational automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, United States.During the initial quarter of 2023, the company experienced an impressive 11.1% growth in revenue compared to the previous year, reaching nearly $40 billion. Additionally, the automotive operating cash flow for the quarter rose to $2.3 billion, showcasing a significant increase from $1.6 billion in the same period of the previous year.Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) from an Equal Weight rating to an Overweight rating on May 1. Additionally, the analyst increased the price target on the stock from $35 to $38. Recognizing General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) as one of the leading companies in the auto sector, Jones included it in his list of the ""top 5"" automotive companies.According to Insider Monkey’s Q1 2023 database, 73 hedge funds disclosed long positions in General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), worth roughly $4 billion. Of these, investment firm Harris Associates holds a significant position as a shareholder.6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American multinational consumer goods corporation headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. The company provides branded consumer packaged goods worldwide, operating through Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segments.On April 11, the company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.9407 per share, marking a 3% increase. With this raise, the company extended its impressive streak of dividend growth to 67 years, solidifying its position as not only one of the top dividend aristocrat stocks on our list, but also one of the best forever stock.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), compared to 74 funds in the preceding quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.94 million shares valued at $735.2 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”Much like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a top 'forever' stock finding favor with hedge funds.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Now.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Buy for a Month.The momentum investing philosophy aims to leverage price movements of stocks. The key idea behind momentum investing is that price trends of stocks can persist for a certain time and investors can/should ride those trends and make the most out of them. If a stock is showing signs of going up, buy that stock and ride the upward price trend and sell it as soon as it shows signs of peaking. That’s momentum investing in simple terms and it sure looks straightforward and easy on paper. But does research provides any backing to this investment philosophy? Let’s find out.Several research papers have shown stock momentum does play a key role in stock movements. These research papers show that stock prices do not follow random paths. Instead, their past movements and trends can help investors predict and foresee their future trends to some extent. In a paper titled The 52-Week High and Momentum Investing, Thomas George and Chuan-Yang Hwang quote research from Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) which says that stock returns show “momentum behavior at intermediate horizons.”  The paper also says that a strategy that buys the top 10% and sells the bottom 10% of stocks ranked by returns during the past 6 months, and holds the positions for 6 months, produces profits of 1% per month.  The paper also quotes research from Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999) which says that momentum in individual stock returns is driven by momentum in industry returns.The paper then shows the importance of 52-week highs and lows in investing and how different biases come into play in investors’ thought process when a stock hits 52-week high or low. The paper says:“Our results indicate that the 52-week measure has predictive power whether or not individual stocks have had extreme past returns. This suggests that price level is important, and is consistent with an anchor-and-adjust bias. Traders appear to use the 52-week high as a reference point against which they evaluate the potential impact of news. When good news has pushed a stock’s price near or to a new 52-week high, traders are reluctant to bid the price of the stock higher even if the information warrants it. The information eventually prevails and the price moves up, resulting in a continuation. Similarly, when bad news pushes a stock’s price far from its 52-week high, traders are initially unwilling to sell the stock at prices that are as low as the information implies. The information eventually prevails and the price falls.”Story continuesAnother famous research backs the claims on effectiveness of momentum investor. According to data from University of Chicago finance professor (and Nobel laureate) Eugene Fama and Dartmouth College finance professor Kenneth French, since 1927, a portfolio holding 10% of stocks with the best trailing 12-month returns would have beaten the broader market by 6.7 annualized percentage points.AQR Capital in 2009 published a detailed research paper on momentum investing titled “The Case for Momentum Investing.” The paper summarized various studies and researches that point to the effectiveness of momentum investing. For example, the paper demonstrates  average annual returns for portfolios grouped by momentum for a period starting from January 1927 to December 2008. The data shows that stocks with the best momentum easily outperform the stocks with the worst momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to the equity market as a whole.The AQR research paper also highlights an important psychological factor that plays a key role in the success of momentum investing. Whenever a stock rises based on good news, the average investor tends to sell the stock to lock the gains. On the other hand when a company announces bad news, the average investor would hold on to the stock instead of quickly selling it in hopes of breaking even. This psychological factor is directly linked to momentum investing. The paper says:""Investors (as human beings) are prone to what behavioral economists and experimental psychologists call the disposition effect. Investors tend to sell winning investments prematurely to lock in gains, and hold on to losing investments too long in the hope of breaking even. The disposition effect creates an artificial headwind: when good news is announced, the price of an asset does not immediately rise to its value because of premature selling. Similarly, when bad news is announced, the price falls less because investors are reluctant to sell.""Tobias J. Moskowitz, PhD, in his paper titled Momentum Investing: Finally Accessible for Individual Investors, shares some data which compares the performance of long-only momentum portfolio to other long-only stock investing strategy during a 30-year period starting from December 1979 to December 2009. The analysis shows that momentum investing outperformed the market or a core index portfolio by a wide margin. For large-cap stocks, momentum outperformed the Russell 1000 by about 2 percent a year. A small-cap momentum index outperformed the Russell 2000 by 3.7 percent a year. In addition, momentum outperformed value by 1.5 percent a year and growth by more than 3 percent a year.Best Stocks to Buy for a MonthOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned the holdings of iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) and picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

In addition to America’s very strong macro trends, many companies have been reporting excellent results in the last several weeks. For example, electric-vehicle makers Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) reported June delivery data that came in above analysts’ average estimates. Even memory maker Micron (NASDAQ:MU), homebuilder Lennar (NYSE:LEN), alcohol beverage maker Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), and auto retailer CarMax (NYSE:KMX) all reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results. At a time when it definitely makes sense to buy growth stocks, here are the seven best growth stocks to buy in July.Bionano (BNGO)Hand of woman watering small plant in pot shaped like growing graph representing growth stocksSource: Khakimullin Aleksandr / ShutterstockImpressive news has rolled in recently for Bionano (NASDAQ:BNGO), whose system enables optical genome mapping (OGM). In an article tweeted by my fellow BNGO enthusiast, Greg Larssen, it was reported  that Israel’s well-respected Rambam Hospital “is creating a new database that will include OGM test results.” The article added that “the data will be used to research genetic changes and their implications, with the goal of improving the medical care cancer patients receive worldwide.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe fact that a prestigious hospital believes that OGM can improve the  “medical care cancer patients receive” shows how valuable OGM is, and of course, that’s great news for BNGO. Even more promising for BNGO and for humanity is the next sentence: ” Dr. Karin Weiss, director of the Genetics Institute at Rambam, maintains that OGM technology will eventually be used to diagnose other diseases, tumor types, and cases of unresolved hereditary diseases in children.” If tens of millions of children are tested with Bionano’s OGM systems, many tens of thousands of lives will be saved, and BNGO stock will surge many dozens of times.Story continuesRivian (RIVN)A businessman holding a coin with a tree that grows and a tree that grows on a pile of money representing growth stocks. growth stocksSource: MEE KO DONG / ShutterstockOn July 3, start-up  EV maker Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) reported that it had delivered 12,640 EVs last quarter, well above analysts’ average estimate of 11,300. The Street cheered the news enthusiastically,  as RIVN stock soared 17.4% to $19.56 on July 3, reaching its highest level since February.And in more good news for Rivian and the owners of RIVN stock,  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has reportedly begun using the automaker’s delivery van in Europe. The latter development is a sign that the e-commerce giant remains pleased with the performance of Rivian’s vans. Further, as I pointed out in a prior, recent column “It seems that RIVN has a big hit on its hands with the R1S,” its new SUV. Despite the name’s recent rally, its market capitalization of $18.37 billion far undervalues the company’s long-term outlook.General Electric (GE)An image of three yellow arrows on a red background.Source: smshoot/ShutterStock.comInvestor’s Business Daily recently published a glowing article about General Electric’s (NYSE:GE) stock, citing the multiple, positive catalysts that its aerospace business has. Specifically, the publication noted that the aerospace unit “boasts robust growth estimates” and could combine with Honeywell’s (NASDAQ:HON) aerospace unit.GE’s aerospace business is expected to become a standalone company early next year, with GE splitting itself into an aerospace company and a firm that focuses on businesses connected to electrical power. Among the positive catalysts for the aerospace business cited by Investor’s Business Daily are the continued increases in “global air traffic,” which  “now stands at roughly 90% of pre-pandemic levels,” China’s reopening, which is also sparking more demand for flights, and increased demand for military planes. The publication noted that last month, GE obtained orders for over 1000 of its commercial jet engines.Meanwhile, GE’s Power business should grow rapidly amid the greatly increased demand for electricity due to the electrification of transportation.

The company’s earnings missed estimates in the last reported quarter.Factors to NoteProgressive’s compelling product portfolio, its leadership position, strength in the Vehicle and Property businesses, healthy policies in force and solid retention are likely to have favored net premiums earned in the quarter under review. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net premiums earned is pegged at $14.3 billion, suggesting growth of 17.4% from the year-ago reported number. We estimate net premiums earned of $12.9 billion for the to-be-reported quarter.Segmentation and prudent risk selection have likely aided policies in force. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for personal lines’ policies in force is pegged at 24.8 million, indicating an improvement of 9.7% from the year-ago reported figure. We estimate policies in force of 28.4 million for the to-be-reported quarter.Focus on marketing and competitive product offerings, and a strong market presence are likely to have aided PGR’s personal auto business. Increased travel across the world is likely to have induced higher auto premiums.A higher invested asset base and higher interest rates are likely to have aided net investment income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $434 million, up 48.6% from the year-ago reported quarter. We estimate a net investment income of $325.2 million in the to-be-reported quarter.The top line is likely to have benefited from higher premiums, increased net investment income, a rise in service revenues as well as fees and other revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pinned at $15 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 18.3%.Expenses are likely to have risen on higher loss and loss-adjustment expenses, policy acquisition costs, and other underwriting expenses. Total operating expenses are likely to increase 0.6% year over year to $12.7 billion. The consensus mark for the loss and loss-adjustment expense ratio is pegged at 79.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 91 cents, indicating a 4.2% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Progressive this time. This is because a stock needs to have a combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.Earnings ESP: Progressive has an Earnings ESP of -4.63%.

368,387fabf2-fba7-33ca-9840-9c27d703bfb0,VLO,2023-07-12,Safety First: 3 Dividend Stocks for Investors Seeking Stability,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/safety-first-3-dividend-stocks-193439227.html,1688585679,STORY,"['KR', 'VLO', 'CF']","[With the most recent read on inflation seemingly suggesting a trajectory of disinflation, the very concept of dividend stocks for stability seems overly cautious. Fundamentally, I would gently suggest a rethink of this framework. Because so-called safe dividend investments provide passive income, they’re relevant in any market cycle.However, the specific concept of safety first investing isn’t as ridiculous as it might appear. Sure, inflation may have ticked down from analysts’ expectations. Nevertheless, consumer prices remain exceptionally elevated against pre-pandemic norms. Also, the underlying economy might not be as robust as you think, adding weight to stable dividend stocks.As the May jobs report pointed out, while the economy added 339,000 jobs (well above expectations), the unemployment rate ticked higher. Also, the average length of the workweek and the pace of wage growth declined. With resiliency lacking a holistic element, dividend stocks for stability make plenty of sense.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKroger (KR)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comAs a retail giant operating supermarkets and multi-department stores, Kroger (NYSE:KR) effectively sells itself as one of the dividend stocks for stability. No matter what’s going on in the economy, people need nutritional sustenance to survive and thrive. While it’s not particularly exciting – with KR stock gaining just under 7% since the start of the year – the business itself is permanently relevant.On the financial side, Kroger might not have the most bulletproof balance sheet, I must say. Nevertheless, it rings true operationally, featuring a three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 10.3%, beating out 70% of its peers. Also, as you might expect, Kroger features a consistently profitable enterprise.Regarding its case as one of the stable dividend stocks, Kroger carries a forward yield of 2.45%. While modest, it’s noticeably above the consumer staples sector’s average yield of 1.89%. In addition, the payout ratio sits at a lowly 25.51%, providing confidence for yield sustainability. With 17 years of consecutive dividend increases, it’s a status management that won’t give up cheaply.Story continuesCF Industries (CF)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA manufacturer and distributor of agricultural fertilizers, including ammonia, urea, and ammonium nitrate products, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) plays a major role in the global food supply chain equation. Unfortunately, the business itself suffers from the conflict in Eastern Europe, which has impacted global fertilizer supply. While I still contend that CF ranks among dividend stocks for stability based on the core relevant narrative, the acute conflict-related headwind poses challenges.For example, since the start of the year, CF slipped 14%. Over the trailing one-year period, the security gave up almost 16% of its equity value. That’s not the kind of performance one would normally associate with safe dividend investments, I’ll freely admit. At the same time, forward-thinking contrarians might see an opportunity here. For example, CF trades at a forward multiple of 7.72, below the underlying sector median of 9.37. Also, the company overall benefits from strong long-term revenue growth and robust profitability metrics.As for being one of the dividend stocks for stability, CF features a forward yield of 2.27%, which is modest. However, with a payout ratio of 22.59%, CF stakeholders can rest assured of their passive income.Valero Energy (VLO)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAs a downstream petroleum company, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) might seem an odd idea if you’re looking for safety first investing. Basically, the hydrocarbon energy market suffered significant headwinds in large part because of rising borrowing costs. With many countries’ central banks adopting a hawkish monetary policy in an effort to curb inflation, Valero hasn’t exactly enjoyed a stellar performance.To be sure, since the Jan. opener, VLO gave up a bit more than 2% of its equity value. Still, I think there’s some potential here as one of the high-yield stable stocks. Over the trailing one-year period, VLO gained over 13%. Fundamentally, the gradual return to full normalization should increase traffic volume to pre-pandemic levels. That alone would likely dramatically benefit Valero’s downstream business by expanding the addressable market.As for passive income, Valero carries a forward yield of 3.47%, which is a bit lower than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. However, its payout ratio sits at 30.88%, offering confidence regarding yield sustainability. Overall, the potential for rising relevance makes VLO one of the top dividend stocks for stability.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

To skip our detailed analysis of the podcast and Discovery Capital Management's holdings, you can go directly to see the second part of Rob Citrone Podcast and Top 5 Stock Picks.Today, Rob Citrone is an American billionaire hedge fund manager and one of the co-founders of Discovery Capital Management. However, a quick dive into his background shows that Citrone comes from ""modest roots,"" as he himself put it in a Capital Allocators with Ted Seides podcast last July. Citrone began by saving up and sticking his money in money market funds and mutual funds. From here, Citrone began investing in stocks and developed a love for the investment field. During the start of his career on Wall Street, Citrone became involved in emerging markets through his work during the Latin American debt crisis. He moved on to Fidelity Investments in Boston and began heading the company's emerging markets fixed income and currency group. After this, he jumped to Tiger Management, where he worked as a portfolio manager as well before he eventually founded Discovery Capital.Citrone's Comparisons: The Economy of the Past Versus 2022In this podcast, Citrone offers valuable insights into the state of the US economy today while drawing comparisons between past financial crises in emerging markets and the US markets today. Here are some of his comments on his experience during the 1987 stock market crash:""I can remember the crash in '87, and I can remember it was one of the longest days that I ever experienced. I think we just stared at the screens and we were just in shock that the equity market was down 20 some percent in a day. But then the Fed came in and just eased liquidity massively. It was an interesting time to buy, obviously, and we could see that and feel that. That's why things recovered very quickly. The amount of liquidity they pumped into the system had a huge impact.""Story continuesOn noting the above, Citrone added that the situation back then was different from how it was in 2022. He noted the following:""Today the problem is we can't do that, we've already done that. Now we have to go the other way, actually take liquidity out of the market. Even if the market will crash, there's not much the Fed can do because of the inflation issue.""The way Citrone saw it, by July 2022, the US market was entering the second phase of the market correction, the first phase being inflation. In the second phase, Citrone expected to see a ""significant withdrawal of liquidity"" from the market. While comparing the US economy in the present to the way it used to be, he also noted a significant difference, considering the fact that significantly more people have their wealth circulating in the market today compared to in 1987.Positions and Opinions On Global Markets and IndustriesMoving forward, Citrone was questioned on the positions he was taking in the market. On this front, he noted that the Chinese currency is ""a great short,"" making it one of his larger positions. In fact, Citrone mentioned that he had been shorting China since August 2021. However, he had decided to ""temper"" this position in the event either that President Xi Jinping did not get a second term or that he got the second term and ended up surrounded by ""reformers."" For Citrone, these events would result in him altering his bearish view of China. In terms of the rest of the world, Citrone mentioned that he was bullish on the US and on India, with the latter being dubbed by him as ""the new growth country of the world."" He also expected Latin America, particularly Brazil, to go through a recovery period which would make it an excellent investment opportunity. However, he views Africa as a difficult region to approach because of political instability in countries like South Africa.As the podcast progressed, Citrone was questioned on his opinion on the technology industry. He said the following:""Technology is still a fantastic area to invest in going forward, but I still think that the multiples are too high for most companies. Anytime a company's still being priced to sales, or they're talking about the TAM, I want nothing to do with that company.""While he noted that he expects technology companies to be challenged during 2023, he did add that the industry was a good long-term investment opportunity. All in all, Citrone highlighted some important viewpoints on a number of issues during the podcast, ranging from his past experiences and his opinions on various global markets to specific industries and businesses such as the technology industry and the hedge fund business. He has managed to successfully maintain a portfolio including several major companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) through the years, highlighting his keen eye for profitable investment opportunities as they spring up. The performance of his portfolio has also been commendable. According to Bloomberg, Discovery Capital ended 2022 up 18%, and in January, the fund gained 4%. The January gain made it one of the only hedge funds actually to make money during the market instability seen at the start of 2023. As a result, Citrone has established himself as an investor to follow today, leading us to compile a list of his top holdings.Rob Citrone Podcast and Stock PicksOur MethodologyWe have selected Discovery Capital Management's top 10 holdings, according to the hedge fund's 13F holdings filed this March on Insider Monkey.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) shares as of June 15, alongside a $128 price target.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a big tech company operating in the interactive media and services industry. It is based in Mountain View, California.There were 155 hedge funds long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $18.6 billion.Manole Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Despite this, the S&amp;P 500 is up 7% this year and the Nasdaq is up +11%. Technology rebounded from a challenging 2022 and many large tech companies are performing quite well this year. Through mid-May 2023, year-to-date performance of some of the most popular and largest names tech names is impressive. For tech companies with market capitalizations over $1 trillion, Apple is up +35%, Microsoft +33%, Amazon +39%, and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is +40%. If you add in Nvdia, Google and Meta, you have three quarters of the entire S&amp;P 500’s year-to-date return.For our purposes, we are just going to focus on software digital wallets, as they are much more common and accessible. If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay pre-loaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use. Those two, along with Google Pay and PayPal, are the four most popular digital wallets today. According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%.We are loyal Apple users (iPhones, iPads, iMac) and find their Apple Pay to be a convenient and safe digital wallet to use. It is currently accepted at more than 90% of US retailers, so it clearly has widespread adoption. Samsung and Google users also seem pleased with their preferred digital wallets. In our opinion, these new entrants are “a bit too late to the party” to make a meaningful dent versus established players.As of today, both Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay have a distinct advantage in the digital wallet arena. These three firms have spent billions of dollars ensuring that their apps are easy to use on their smartphones. Plus, and maybe more importantly, the consumer experience is embedded and native to the operating system. This ties their digital wallet to the device, which cannot be replicated.”7. Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Number of Shares Held by Discovery Capital Management: 216,489Portfolio Percentage: 4.13%At the end of the first quarter, 48 hedge funds were long Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET). Their total stake value was $1.4 billion.On May 2, Jim Kelleher at Argus Research maintained a Buy rating on Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) shares, alongside placing a $195 price target on the stock.Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) is an information technology company. It is based in Santa Clara, California.Giverny Capital Asset Management, LLC said the following about Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Our holding Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) continues to generate extraordinary results, which the market recognizes. Arista rose 38% during the first quarter and became our largest holding. Arista makes switches, routers and operating software that power enormous data networks, such as for cloud computing. Microsoft’s Azure cloud business and Meta Platforms’ Facebook and Instagram networks are Arista’s two most important customers. Roughly speaking, Arista has tripled its revenue and profit over the past five years and seems poised to continue growing rapidly for the foreseeable future. Demand for hyperscale computing networks may accelerate as artificial intelligence (AI) chat applications grow. By some estimates, the computer power required to answer Al chat queries is roughly seven times more than for a Google or Bing search. I think the realization that data network capacity needs to be much larger to accommodate Al has driven recent enthusiasm for Arista.In general, I think when a stock blows through my price target the right answer is to bask in the glory and maybe splurge on a latte rather than my usual morning coffee. Don’t get itchy about locking in a profit. In this case, Arista became our largest holding and roughly 8.5% of the portfolio, while also being one of the most expensive businesses we own on a price-to-earnings basis. Arista earned $4.27 in 2022 and I believe there is good reason to expect it to double EPS again, perhaps by 2026 or 2027. But as the stock traded into the $160s, that represents a PE of 20x estimated earnings in four years. While I believe strongly in Arista’s competitive position, I know that tech giants are facing budget constraints and a pause in their own intense pace of infrastructure growth would not surprise anyone….” (Click here to read the full text)Like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) is a highly popular stock among hedge funds today.6. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128Number of Shares Held by Discovery Capital Management: 422,065Portfolio Percentage: 4.9%Citadel Investment Group was the most prominent shareholder in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) at the end of the first quarter, holding 11.4 million shares.Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is a leading Chinese company operating in the broad-line retail and e-commerce spaces. It is based in Hangzhou, China.In total, 128 hedge funds were long Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $5.9 billion.A Buy rating was reiterated on Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) shares on June 21 by Fawne Jiang at Benchmark, who also maintained a $180 price target on the stock.Here's what Baron Funds had to say about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is the largest retailer and e-commerce company in China. Alibaba operates shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall and owns 33% of Ant Group, which operates Alipay, China’s largest third-party online payment provider. Shares of Alibaba were up this quarter, given meaningful margin expansion, guidance to stabilize core commerce market share in China, and an announced plan to split the company into six units which could further unlock value. We retain conviction that Alibaba is well positioned to benefit from China’s reopening and the ongoing growth in online commerce and cloud in China.”Click to continue reading and see Rob Citrone's Top 5 Stock Picks.Suggested articles:George Soros’ Top 10 Stock PicksLong-Term Stock Portfolio: Best Stocks for 20 YearsKanye West Stock Portfolio vs. Warren Buffett Stock PortfolioDisclosure: None.

The consensus mark has witnessed two upward revisions and four downward movements in the past 30 days. The consensus estimate for second-quarter revenues of $90.6 billion indicates a 12.8% increase from the year-ago reported figure.UnitedHealth beat the consensus estimate for earnings in all the prior four quarters, with the average being 4%. This is depicted in the graph below:UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseUnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseUnitedHealth Group Incorporated price-eps-surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at UNH’s previous-quarter performance first.Q1 Earnings RewindThe healthcare plan provider reported adjusted earnings of $6.26 per share for the last quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.3% on the back of sustained membership growth in its UnitedHealthcare business. Strong expansion in value-based arrangements at the Optum Health segment also contributed to the upside. However, the positives were partly offset by elevated operating costs.Now let’s see how things have shaped up before the second-quarter earnings announcement.Q2 Factors to NoteIncreased premiums, backed by strong membership growth, are likely to have supported UnitedHealth’s second-quarter results. Our estimate for premium revenues suggests a 10% year-over-year increase, thanks to higher premiums generated from Optum Health and its health benefits business, UnitedHealthcare.While our estimate for product revenues indicates more than 4% year-over-year growth, the same for services revenues suggests a more than 23% year-over-year jump from the year-ago level of $6,645 million. Higher services revenues across the board are likely to have aided UNH’s top line in the second quarter.Story continuesRevenues from UnitedHealthcare, UNH’s largest segment that sells insurance, are likely to have increased on higher memberships in selected programs. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealthcare’s total commercial customers signals 3.4% year-over-year growth. Our estimate for segmental revenues indicates a more than 9% year-over-year growth. Furthermore, investments and other income are likely to have witnessed a more than 150% surge from the year-ago level.The Optum business segment is expected to have witnessed higher contributions from each of the sub-segments in the second quarter. A rise in the number of people being catered to in value-based care arrangements and the growing strength of affiliated physicians is likely to aid the results.Our estimate for operating income from the Optum business segment suggests an 18.1% year-over-year increase. This is expected to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth in the bottom line.However, UnitedHealth is likely to have faced an elevated expense level due to a rise in medical and operating costs. Higher costs of products sold are likely to have reduced its margins. Seniors undergoing elective procedures, which were delayed due to the pandemic, are likely to have accelerated medical costs.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNH’s medical care ratio is pegged at 82.66%, up from 81.50% in the year-ago quarter. Our estimates for medical and operating costs indicate 12.2% and 9.8% year-over-year increases, respectively. This is likely to have affected its profit levels in the second quarter, making an earnings beat uncertain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for UnitedHealth this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -1.41%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at $5.94 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.03.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: UnitedHealth currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for UnitedHealth, here are some companies from the broader Medical space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Neogen Corporation NEOG has an Earnings ESP of +33.33% and is a Zacks #1 Ranked player.

372,17f595a3-c372-38ee-a13a-777771ab876a,PG,2023-07-12,FOCUS-Investors target consumer goods makers on fears of customer exodus over high prices,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-investors-target-consumer-goods-100000033.html,1689156000,STORY,"['JHG', 'PG']","[By Richa Naidu and Jessica DiNapoliLONDON/NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - Top U.S. and European investors are flagging their concerns about high prices to consumer goods companies, with Janus Henderson going so far as to cut some stakes it holds and shorting food makers it believes are at risk of losing customers.The industry, which is due to report second quarter earnings in the coming weeks, has sharply hiked prices for over two years to make up for soaring cost inflation that started with the COVID pandemic and worsened due to shortages triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and extreme weather.In the U.S., consumer prices rose 4% in the 12 months ending in May while food inflation in the euro zone stood at 12.5% in May.Consumer goods makers say the price hikes are necessary, and that they have taken a hit to margins over the past two years. Some companies such as Clorox have even begun to ease off the hikes to protect sales volumes as input costs fall.Janus Henderson, one of the world's top investors with over 250 billion pounds ($322.45 billion) in assets under management, said it had already cut stakes in some food companies because continued high prices could prompt a sharp fall in volumes they sell.""In the U.S. in particular, these pressures are more acute than in Europe,"" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Luke Newman told Reuters. ""There's a very real risk of volume falls, which could be very dramatic in terms of revenue for these companies.""In particular, the asset manager is scrutinizing food manufacturers, including cereal makers, Newman said.""We've reduced our holdings to those categories and actually initiated some short positions as well,"" he said.Other investors, including Richard Marwood, a senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, also said they were talking to consumer goods firms about the impact of high prices on volumes.San Francisco-based Parnassus Investments has been discussing trimming its stakes in companies making household staples because the asset management firm expects revenues to ""decelerate,"" said Robert Klaber, a portfolio manager.Story continuesParnassus holds shares of P&amp;G and Triscuit maker Mondelez, among other consumer products makers and retailers.In the U.S., some investors are worried that cuts to the food stamps program for low-income earners and the reversal of the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness plan will bite into consumers' spending power.U.S. consumer strength has begun weakening, ""and that's bad news for the consumer companies,"" Barclays analyst Iain Simpson said.TRADING DOWNWith raw material and energy costs soaring over the past two years, companies have minimized damage to profits and margins largely by passing them on to retailers and shoppers.Still, cost inflation has chipped away at margins, which have broadly fallen 2-4 percentage points over the past two years for the consumer goods industry. But, for some, they remain at a healthy 16-18% rate.Price increases have in many cases come at the expense of sales volumes, however, as shoppers ""trade down"" to cheaper private label alternatives and smaller pack sizes.On average, median reported prices at the world's top 30 consumer goods companies rose 11.2% in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to restructuring consultancy Alvarez &amp; Marsal, while median sales volumes were down about 2%.Sales volumes fell nearly 5% in the household &amp; personal care sector - where Procter &amp; Gamble is No.1 - while food, beverages and alcohol showed less dramatic declines.'GREEDFLATION' ACCUSATIONSSome lawmakers and regulators in the United States and Europe have accused consumer goods manufacturers and retailers of price gouging and ""greedflation"", or padding revenues by charging more than they need to recoup high input costs.David Chavern, CEO of the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group that counts P&amp;G and Clorox among its members, in response, says the industry has ""contended with a stream of unprecedented inflationary pressures"" since the pandemic.""The resulting domino effect has spurred waves of impacts on consumer costs that have been mischaracterized by some,"" he said. ""The reality is that our economy is still in a settling period, not a deflationary one, that the industry is carefully navigating as it continues working tirelessly to meet consumer demand.""The issue is an important one, and one for investors to talk to companies about since ""greedflation"" prioritises short-term profit over long-term consumer loyalty and sales, said Stephanie Niven, portfolio manager of the Ninety One Global Sustainable Equity Fund.""Relationships with consumers are coming under scrutiny, perhaps into jeopardy and the long term competitive advantage of that business, particularly if it rests on consumer brand loyalty, can be very problematic,"" said Niven.Irene Jensen, portfolio manager at Norway's sovereign wealth fund, Norges Bank Investment Management, said she believes ""there are some companies who have probably been a bit opportunistic"" and the perception of price gouging is ""potentially harmful.""""The risk now is that the consumer down-trades into private label, gets to test out these products and then discovers that they're as good as the brands or good enough for them,"" Jensen said, adding that her team had raised concerns with companies.Other asset managers argue the accusations of opportunistic price hikes are unmerited.""We will have to wait a few months or quarters till we know who's right,"" said Thomas Joekel, a portfolio manager at Unilever and Reckitt top-20 shareholder Union Investment, arguing that falling margins at companies were proof that they were not gouging consumers.($1 = 0.7753 pounds) (Reporting by Richa Naidu and Jessica DiNapoli; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Deepa Babington)]"

For more stocks on this list, head on over to 5 Best Forever Stocks to Buy Now.The macroeconomic landscape in the United States, which has been a focal point in headlines and the stock market for over two years, is undergoing a rapid transformation. Just a year ago, investors' primary concerns revolved around interest rates and heightened inflation. However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent commodity shock, along with pandemic-induced stimulatory spending, compelled the Federal Reserve to swiftly increase interest rates. As the market enters the second half of 2023, the Federal Reserve's decisive approach to interest rate hikes is finally bringing about some clarity regarding an economic cooldown.Earlier this June, Fed officials made predictions indicating their intention to raise interest rates twice more within the year, assuming these adjustments would be made in quarter-point increments. However, that does not mean that the Fed must hurt the labor market to achieve policymakers’ goals. In fact, Fed Chair Powell has acknowledged that wages are not necessarily the primary factor driving current inflation. He has noted that wages and inflation often exhibit a correlated relationship, but determining which one is causing the other is challenging to determine.As the July 7 payrolls report approached, traders were preparing for a potentially impactful event. Surprisingly robust data released by the ADP Research Institute a day prior had convinced the market that job growth in the US was still ""too strong"" from the perspective of central bankers cautious about inflation. According to the report, US employers added 209,000 jobs in June, falling short of Wall Street expectations. This led to concerns that the Federal Reserve might implement tighter monetary policy. However, the outcome presented a more nuanced view of the labor market, indicating a moderate slowdown that aligns with the Fed's objectives, albeit at a slower pace than anticipated by some. Investors widely expect the Fed to raise interest rates at their July meeting, and the strength of the labor market could help to shape the outlook after that.Story continuesThese are all developments affecting the market in the short-term. If you are a long-term investor who is looking for forever stocks to buy as we do in our monthly newsletter, you hope that the stock market declines by at least 20% to buy your favorite stocks at a discount. At the end of September 2022, the market provided such an opportunity. We don't think we are going to get another opportunity in the near future and this may be relatively the best time to buy.As the market closed the first half of this year with a positive boost from a reassuring inflation report, the notion of acquiring the best ""forever stocks"" might appear overly cautious. With market sentiment strong and supported by seemingly justifiable factors, investors may lean towards riskier securities with higher potential returns. However, it's important to acknowledge that long-term stock investments hold their own value and significance. With these details in mind, let’s take a look at some potential forever stocks, out of which the top picks include the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), among others listed below.13 Best Forever Stocks to Buy NowOur Methodology""Our favorite holding period is forever."" When it comes to long-term investments, who better to imitate than Wall Street's legendary value investor, Warren Buffett. In order to compile our selection of the best forever stocks, we began by analyzing Buffett's stock portfolio and chose to highlight the stock holdings that have remained within his portfolio for at least 5 years. Next, we assessed the number of hedge fund investors associated with each stock based on Insider Monkey’s survey of 943 funds during the first quarter of this year. Using this information, the stocks were ranked.To be clear the following 13 stocks are the best forever stocks to buy according to billionaire investor and secret hedge fund manager Warren Buffett. We have our own list of favorite forever stocks that we share in our premium newsletter. You should do your own research and decide any of the following stocks fit your definition of forever stocks:13. DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) is a prominent healthcare company specializing in kidney care services. With a significant presence, it ranks among the largest providers of dialysis services in the United States. The company's primary focus lies in treating individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney failure.Lisa Bedell Clive at Bernstein issued an update on May 15, raising the price target on DaVita Inc. (NYSE: DVA) from $88 to $100. This adjustment came in response to the company's improved 2023 guidance, which was announced on May 9.After digging through 943 hedge funds for their March quarter of 2023 investments, Insider Monkey discovered that 32 had bought DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)’s shares. The firm’s second largest investor after Warren Buffett is Jeffrey Gates’ Gates Capital Management, owning one million shares that are worth $84 million.Here is what Moon Capital Management said about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) ranks among the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a decent stock for long-term investments.12. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), commonly known as Kraft Heinz, is an American multinational food company formed by the merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz Company co-headquartered in Chicago and Pittsburgh. The company is involved in making and selling a wide variety of products, including cheese, meals, meats, dairy products, spices, coffee, and others.The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) released its Q1 financial results on May 3, revealing a non-GAAP EPS of $0.68 and revenue of $6.49 billion. These figures exceeded Wall Street estimates by $0.08 and $100 million, respectively. Additionally, the company anticipates a 4% to 6% growth in organic net sales for 2023, as compared to the previous year.Out of the 943 hedge funds included in Insider Monkey's Q1 2023 database, 34 of them held a stake in The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC). First Eagle Investment Management, managed by Jean-Marie Eveillard, emerged as the largest hedge fund investor, with a stake worth $256 million, equivalent to 6.6 million shares. However, the largest overall investor in Kraft Heinz is Warren Buffett, with a massive investment of $12 billion.11. VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Verisign Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) is an American company based in Reston, Virginia, United States, that operates a diverse array of network infrastructure that allows firms to maintain their servers, access domain names, and run security applications. The company ended the first quarter of 2023 with 174.8 million domains in the .com/.net base, which was 1 million more than it ended in the same quarter a year ago.By the end of this year’s first quarter, 37 of the 943 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey’s database had held a stake in the company. Following Warren Buffett, Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN)'s largest shareholder, which owns 3.1 million shares that are worth $672 million.10. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), or simply Kroger, is an American retail company that operates supermarkets and multi-department stores throughout the United States. With more than 2,700 supermarkets and multi-department stores spread across 35 states in the United States, The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) ranks as one of the largest food retailers in the world.Earlier this June, UBS lowered the price target on The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) to $48 from $51 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. According to the analysts', sentiment on Kroger remains mixed despite a ""strong"" performance in Q1 as its FY23 outlook remains uncertain. The firm also states that the tone will likely remain mixed until the market gains more confidence in Kroger's intermediate-term outlook and that this will likely leave the stock range-bound for ""the foreseeable future.""Insider Monkey took a look at 943 hedge funds for their first quarter of 2023 investments and found out that 43 had owned The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)’s shares. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns a $2.5 billion stake in the company.Oakmark Funds, advised by Harris Associates, made the following comment about The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption.”9. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO), commonly known as Moody's, is an American business and financial services company. It serves as the parent company for Moody's Investors Service (MIS), an American credit rating agency, and Moody's Analytics (MA), a provider of financial analysis software and services based in the United States.Jeffrey Silber, an analyst at BMO Capital, restated an Outperform rating for Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) stock on May 17, while increasing the target price from $355 to $360. Silber holds the belief that Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) has the potential for a substantial upside of over 16%, considering the closing stock price as of May 18.By the end of Q1 2023, 51 of the 943 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey had bought a stake in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO). A major hedge fund investor is Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management with a $3.17 billion stake.8. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Established in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is a prominent American multinational corporation renowned for its production of the iconic Coca-Cola beverage. In addition to its flagship product, the company is involved in the manufacturing, sales, and marketing of a diverse array of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and even some alcoholic beverages within the beverage industry. As one of the largest beverage corporations globally, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) holds a significant position among the long-term investments of renowned value investor Warren Buffett. Buffett, who has maintained a stake in the company since 2010, has famously expressed his unwavering commitment to retain his shares in the company.On June 6, HSBC analyst Carlos Laboy lowered the price target on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to $74 from $77 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst views Coca-Cola as a much better defensive stock in inflationary times than in the past. However, his near term concern for beverage giant remains the ongoing tax litigation, which it says could cost the company up to 14 billion in payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 58 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $24.8 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next year’s forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”7. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73General Motors, formally the General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), is an American multinational automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, United States.During the initial quarter of 2023, the company experienced an impressive 11.1% growth in revenue compared to the previous year, reaching nearly $40 billion. Additionally, the automotive operating cash flow for the quarter rose to $2.3 billion, showcasing a significant increase from $1.6 billion in the same period of the previous year.Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) from an Equal Weight rating to an Overweight rating on May 1. Additionally, the analyst increased the price target on the stock from $35 to $38. Recognizing General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) as one of the leading companies in the auto sector, Jones included it in his list of the ""top 5"" automotive companies.According to Insider Monkey’s Q1 2023 database, 73 hedge funds disclosed long positions in General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), worth roughly $4 billion. Of these, investment firm Harris Associates holds a significant position as a shareholder.6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American multinational consumer goods corporation headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. The company provides branded consumer packaged goods worldwide, operating through Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segments.On April 11, the company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.9407 per share, marking a 3% increase. With this raise, the company extended its impressive streak of dividend growth to 67 years, solidifying its position as not only one of the top dividend aristocrat stocks on our list, but also one of the best forever stock.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 75 hedge funds were bullish on The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), compared to 74 funds in the preceding quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.94 million shares valued at $735.2 million.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let’s say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let’s assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”Much like Visa Inc.

Investors following this style of investing are usually not interested in betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Everyone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times.It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.Universal Health Services (UHS) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 12.8% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this hospital and health facility operator well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. UHS meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 12.8% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for UHS is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.29. This indicates that the stock moves 29% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that UHS has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped UHS earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, UHS is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. UHS is currently trading at 0.79 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 79 cents for each dollar of sales.So, UHS appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to UHS, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

WTRG announced that its Aqua Ohio subsidiary acquired the Union Rome Sewer (URS) system for $25.5 million, adding 5,300 connections to the company’s customer base in Lawrence County, OH.Since the URS system had been running in deficit for years, the much-needed upgrade and maintenance was delayed due to a lack of funds. This acquisition will ensure the necessary upgrade of the aging assets of the URS system. Essential Utilities arm plans to invest more than $12.7 million in the wastewater system within the next five years to meet regulatory and environmental demands.Essential Utilities has been active on the acquisition front. It has been expanding operations through systematic acquisitions. URS system is the second-completed acquisition from Essential Utilities, followed by the March 2023 acquisition of Pennsylvania-based North Heidelberg Sewer Company.Consolidation: A Must for Fragmented IndustryA primary headwind in the U.S. water industry is that there are too many small operators with limited financial capabilities. Due to financial constraints, the essential upgrades are, at times, deferred, causing infrastructure failure and further resulting in the wastage of precious potable water.Per the American Society of Civil Engineers (""ASCE""), more than 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems in the United States are currently providing water solutions to customers.Per the ASCE findings, due to delays in essential pipeline repairs and maintenance, 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost every day in the United States. Owing to the many small operators in the industry and a lack of adequate funds, essential infrastructural upgrades and repairs get delayed at times.Acquisition of small operators by the bigger players that have more financial capabilities ensures proper maintenance and upgrade of infrastructure. Essential Utilities currently signed seven purchase agreements for eight water and wastewater systems. When completed, these acquisitions will add nearly 213,000 equivalent retail customers or equivalent dwelling units to Essential Utilities’ customer base.Story continuesInvestments for Water SpacePer the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, an estimated $744 billion in investment is necessary to maintain and expand drinking water and wastewater services to meet demand over the next 20 years. Water utilities are gradually consolidating and investing in essential upgrades to their aging assets.Essential Utilities plans to invest $1.1 billion in 2023 and $3.3 billion through 2025 to improve water and natural gas systems and better serve customers using improved information technology.Other water utilities like American Water Works AWK, California Water Service Group CWT and Middlesex Water MSEX have well-chalked-out capital investment plans to strengthen their infrastructure.American Water Works is making regular investments to maintain its infrastructure.

If you want to skip our analysis of the mining industry and want to jump to the top five stocks in this list, head on over to 5 Best Mining Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying. The mining industry is responsible for powering up and providing raw materials to a variety of different industries. Whether it's bauxite for making aluminum, coal for power generation, metals for jewelry, or rare Earth metals for electronics production, mining products contribute significantly to a variety of crucial industries.Not to mention, one particular metal, gold, is quite important in the financial world as well. Gold's relationship with the U.S. dollar is a well known phenomenon, with changes to the dollar's value also creating changes in gold prices. Gold prices are generally inversely correlated to the dollar, as the precious metal is seen as the ultimate safe haven asset. Therefore, gold is also often seen as a barometer of investor sentiment against the dollar - and one that's been quite important, particularly over the past twelve months or so. The dollar has been quite strong as of late thanks to the Federal Reserve's ten interest rate hikes that have attracted deposits in U.S. banks and lent strength to the greenback due to higher demand. However, within the period of these rate hikes, as sentiment sometimes sputtered towards a weaker currency, gold prices have also soared correspondingly.Apart from being important for investors, gold is also becoming quite popular among central banks. The high interest rate environment and its effect on the yields for U.S. Treasury Bonds have stimulated interest among central banks to diversify away from these bonds as their reserves and turn to gold. Multiple data points favor this point of view. For instance, data from the World Gold Council shows that seven out of ten central banks believe that gold reserves will increase over the next twelve months, with 24% expecting to increase their reserves until May 2024.Story continuesShifting our focus from macroeconomics to the mining industry, some of the biggest mining companies in the world are BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), and Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR). Their operations range from mining for fertilizers to metals and the firms rake in billions of dollars of revenue each year. Given the mining giant that it is, BHP has several interesting initiatives that it is focusing on these days. One of these is its collaboration with the technology behemoth Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). BHP and Microsoft have teamed up to use artificial intelligence to improve productivity and extraction efficiency at the world's largest copper mine in Chile. The firm is also looking into innovative accounting methods to include the value of the environment in mine valuation estimates so that it can quantify and inform the public and investors about potential damage to the environment from their operations.Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), an agricultural inputs company that is one of the biggest potash mining companies in the world, expects that America will increase its major crop plantation area by eight million acres this year. At the same time, higher demand coupled with the supply chain constraints that have become an everyday occurrence these days will also ensure that the fertilizer market in the U.S. remains tight. Global potash demand is also expected to stray strong this year, and where supplies from Russia lack, those from Belarus are estimated to pick up the pace.Finally, another mining giant, Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) is looking to grow its copper supply in America. The firm is expanding its mining activities in Utah to invest close to half a billion dollars to deliver 250 thousand tonnes of copper over the next decade. Through these investments, Rio Tinto aims to capture the growing demand for copper from the electric vehicle market which uses the material to make batteries.Concluding our industry introduction by taking a look at what's going on in coal mining is worthwhile since the mineral has grown in popularity recently since the energy market's shakeup due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Here's what the management of the coal mining firm CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE:CEIX) had to say during the firm's first quarter of 2023 earnings call:Overall sales into the export market accounted for 66% of our total PAMC realized coal revenue, including 33% coming from the export industrial market and 13% from the export crossover metallurgical coal market. This is a crucial development for us as it demonstrates our ability to be nimble in utilizing our export marketing and logistic advantages to offset weakness in the domestic energy markets, a unique capability that few domestic coal and E&amp;P companies possess. Furthermore, our sales team opportunistically increased our forward sell position by 13.5 million tons in the first quarter for delivery through 2026, in essence increasing our sales backlog despite a challenging market backdrop. More importantly, the majority of these tons are part of the long-term contracts in the Indian industrial market through 2026, which is exciting, because we expect this market to expand substantially in the coming decade.As we work to increase the capacity of the CONSOL Marine Terminal, we’ll be even better positioned to serve this growing market. As a result of our marketing efforts in 1Q ‘23, we are now near fully contracted for 2023 and have 14.7 million tons contracted for 2024. Now let me provide an update on our balance sheet management and capital allocation progress before discussing our financial results and sustainability initiatives. We continue to make considerable progress on our stated financial priority in the quarter. First, we generated $221 million of free cash flow, approximately 45% of which was deployed toward continuing to reduce our gross debt level. When factoring in our unrestricted cash and short-term investments, our total net debt on March 31 stood at $14 million.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the top mining stocks among hedge funds, with some notable names being Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK), Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

We have bank earnings on Friday, and then you also have Delta reporting on Thursday and Pepsi also expected to report on Thursday, but I think a key theme when you think about this week is really what have the interest rate hikes started to do to the economy.PETER TCHIR: I could see some earnings weakness across the board. I think you're going to see a little bit of tentativeness from companies about consumers. I think it's going to be this story about the US consumer, what's going on there, and global growth. Go back, say, six months to a year, if you talked about your supply chains being OK, that was enough, now it's not about supply chains. It's now, are you able to sell your products, and at what margin are you able to sell those products?BRIAN SOZZI: There is not going to be any year over year sales growth for the S&amp;P 500. That would be the first time that has happened in the past 10 quarters. So not every company is like Nvidia, not everybody is selling AI chips.INES FERRE: Goldman Sachs is saying now the key areas that investors will be watching for is maintaining margins, trying to push sales for profits, the impact of bank stresses and credit lending, the potential uses of AI, and also the health of the consumer-- how much the consumer is willing to spend.- When all of these companies more broadly talk about earnings, especially within that airline travel experience, we're marching towards some of those key time frames for a company in Delta and many of the others in trying to get back to that full capacity. We've heard from Ed Bastian time and time again that this is the year.JIM SMIGIEL: If we look at big banks and even the broader financial sector, they haven't really participated as much in the year to date rally with earnings kind of expectations already being low. The sector we like is a sector we've been overweight most of the year.STEPHEN BIGGAR: I think it's going to be, you know, not banks' finest hour in terms of earnings this quarter. Clearly, the higher rate environment that was very helpful in 2022 for net interest margins is having a detrimental effect now.

(NASDAQ:REGN) Trading At A 33% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regeneron-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaq-regn-120025561.html,1689163225,STORY,['REGN'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fair value estimate is US$1,073Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' US$717 share price signals that it might be 33% undervaluedOur fair value estimate is 25% higher than Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' analyst price target of US$860Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.20bUS$4.47bUS$4.84bUS$5.38bUS$5.73bUS$6.02bUS$6.28bUS$6.50bUS$6.71bUS$6.90bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 6.45%Est @ 5.15%Est @ 4.24%Est @ 3.60%Est @ 3.15%Est @ 2.84% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$3.9kUS$3.9kUS$4.0kUS$4.1kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$39bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$148bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$148b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$76bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$115b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$717, the company appears quite good value at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.803. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Regeneron PharmaceuticalsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

389,377f209d-61c3-3f63-9b12-2722bb9b3daf,REGN,2023-07-12,The 3 Best Biotech Stocks to Buy In July,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-biotech-stocks-buy-170557306.html,1688576757,STORY,"['REGN', 'VRTX', 'GILD']","[Although it’s been a difficult year for biotechnology stocks, there are still plenty of reasons for investors to be bullish on the sector. Many of the biggest innovations in medicine are occurring at small and midsized biotech companies in the U.S. These are the incubators for medical advancements and where important scientific breakthroughs are happening. New products and treatments are boosting sales and earnings at biotech companies, making them great long-term investments.Although the S&amp;P Biotechnology Select Industry Index is slightly down this year compared to a 16% advance for the broader S&amp;P 500 index, the stunted movement can be attributed to investors focusing primarily on mega-cap tech stocks and artificial intelligence (AI) right now. In time, as the current market recovery broadens out, biotech stocks will rise again. Before that happens, investors may want to purchase some while they remain on sale. Here are the three best biotech stocks to buy in July.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRegeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)The Regeneron (REGN) website is displayed on a smartphone screen over a blue background.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comShares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) have pulled back following a big run during the pandemic when the U.S. government awarded the company $450 million to manufacture an antibody cocktail to lessen the severity of Covid-19 symptoms. So far this year, REGN stock is flat (down 0.33%). The shares are currently trading nearly 14% below their 52-week high. But over the long term, Regeneron’s performance looks better, with the stock having almost doubled over the last five years.Beyond Covid, Regeneron specializes in treatments for various eye diseases. Here too, the company has faced some setbacks. In late June, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declined to approve Regeneron’s medication, Eylea, which treats the leading cause of blindness among the elderly. REGN stock dropped nearly 9% on the news. However, many analysts expect the drug to eventually be approved. Regeneron’s stock has a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just over 18 and is likely to remain strong over the long term.Story continuesGilead Sciences (GILD)A Gilead Sciences (GILD) sign at the company headquarters in Silicon Valley, California.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comGilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) is another biotech company that pursued Covid treatments during the pandemic. However, the company’s main focus is developing antiviral drugs used to treat diseases ranging from HIV/AIDS to hepatitis B and hepatitis C, as well as influenza (the flu). GILD stock has pulled back this year along with the biotech and pharmaceutical sectors. Through six months of 2023, GILD stock is down 10%. But even with that decline, the share price remains 23% higher than a year ago.Another reason to be bullish on GILD stock is that the company raised its quarterly dividend payment in June, taking it to 75 cents a share, which equates to a strong yield of 3.91%. Going forward, the company has a series of leading medications used in treating HIV/AIDS that continue to drive its revenues higher. Gilead’s main HIV medication, Biktarvy, had 2022 sales of $10.4 billion, up 20% from 2021. It also has its cancer drug Trodelvy, which caused sales to rise by 79% to $680 million last year.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) logo visible on display screenSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comFor a biotech stock that has bucked the downturn this year, check out Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX). In 2023, VRTX stock has gained 22%, bringing its total increase over the last five years to 100%. The Boston-based company specializes in medications to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, as well as various types of cancer. The company has been particularly successful in developing treatments for cystic fibrosis.A going concern since 1989, Vertex Pharmaceuticals has been an influential biotech company for more than 30 years now. Moving forward, Vertex Pharmaceuticals is developing new treatments for illnesses such as type 1 diabetes and pain management. A robust pipeline of new products should help ensure that Vertex’s revenue stream and earnings remain strong. VRTX stock has a P/E ratio of 27, which isn’t cheap but is still reasonable in comparison to the valuations of the largest pharmaceutical companies.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Although people should think the best of each other, that’s just not reality. Crimes happen and increasingly, they occur in the digital space. Therefore, investing in cybersecurity makes much logical sense.Further, the backdrop of nefarious activity on the internet makes a cynically excellent case for July cybersecurity stock picks. According to Cybercrime Magazine, criminality in the digital ecosystem may cost the world up to $10.5 trillion annually. And that horrible forecast is for 2025. Indeed, just in 2015, cybercrimes cost the global economy $3 trillion.As well, because digital trends have basically encompassed many if not all facets of everyday life, that only opens the door for more nefarious activity. Therefore, buy cybersecurity stocks not only for their relevance but also because it’s just common sense.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIBM (IBM)An image of the word cybersecurity overlaid over a pixelated background, images of locks and shields and virus icons surrounding itSource: BeeBright / ShutterstockAlthough a relatively boring legacy technology enterprise, IBM (NYSE:IBM) makes a great case for the best cybersecurity stocks. Sure, it’s the old dog in the young person’s tech space. However, IBM in recent years has aggressively invested in relevant endeavors such as cloud computing, the blockchain, and of course cybersecurity.Featuring a multi-tiered security network for enterprise-level clients, IBM offers various threat intelligence and cloud security solutions. Especially, the latter service will be critical as more enterprises migrate their data to the cloud. However, IBM also offers ransomware solutions, which represents a major problem in the digital ecosystem.So far this year, IBM hasn’t exactly charmed investors, let’s just be real. Since the January opener, IBM stock slipped almost 6%. At the same time, the company carries a forward yield of 4.97%, far above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Therefore, IBM makes a great case for July cybersecurity stock picks.Story continuesIron Mountain (IRM)A close-up shot of fingers over a keyboard with blue and white text overlaid.Source: ShutterstockAn information management enterprise, Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) is historically associated with physical data storage. Such an analog business might seem incongruent with the best cybersecurity stocks. However, I would respectfully disagree with such a notion. After all, given enough time and resources, an expert hacker can probably break into any system. However, you can’t hack your way into physical documents.However, Iron Mountain isn’t just about the analog world. In fact, it provides myriad digital resources centered on the management of data centers, cloud network security, and financial reporting services, among other contemporary relevancies. Like IBM above, Iron Mountain may seem like a boring enterprise. However, investing in cybersecurity doesn’t have to be exciting. It might even be better if the practice wasn’t raising your blood pressure.Adding to Iron Mountain’s cred is its forward yield of 4.32%. To be fair, the high payout ratio of 182.7% is distracting. Nevertheless, the underlying business remains relevant, making IRM one of the top cyber stocks.Cisco Systems (CSCO)internet security and data protection concept, blockchain and cybersecuritySource: Song_about_summer / ShutterstockYet another staid enterprise among the best cybersecurity stocks to buy, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) probably won’t join the class of meme trades anytime soon. However, as a top-tier cybersecurity play, Cisco makes plenty of sense. A digital communications technology conglomerate, the brand enjoys an excellent reputation and acumen. So far, the market agrees, with shares up over 8% since the Jan. opener.According to its website, Cisco’s information technology services for industrial networks empower security, simplicity, and scale. Again, with more companies migrating their data to the cloud, securing the underlying networks against threats becomes vital. With Cisco’s brand power and market footprint, it carries a significant advantage over the competition. If you’re looking to buy cybersecurity stocks, also carries the advantage of passive income. With a forward yield of 3.01%, it’s not the most generous payout. However, with a payout ratio of 38.54%, investors don’t have to worry too much about yield sustainability.Broadcom (AVGO)A person holding a tablet with a key lock hologram floating above it. Represents cybersecurity stocks.Source: ShutterstockWhile Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) often generates headlines for its on-again, off-again relationship with consumer tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the former enterprise makes a strong case for the best cybersecurity stocks to buy. Known for its wide range of semiconductor products, it also offers relevancies for cybersecurity because of its infrastructural software offerings. Since the start of the year, AVGO gained a remarkable 58%.While AVGO certainly runs hot, so too do cybercrimes, which may cynically help augment Broadcom’s rally. According to its website, the company “…offers a broad portfolio of embedded security solutions, industry-leading mainframe security and payment authentication software, and a best-in-class suite of integrated Symantec cyber security software.”Though not nearly as generous as other top cyber stocks that pay dividends, Broadcom relatively holds its own with a forward yield of 2.1%. You also have to figure out that it’s one of the more exciting propositions so AVGO enjoys more chart mobility. As well, Broadcom commands 13 years of consecutive dividend increases, a status it won’t want to give up too easily.Check Point Software (CHKP)A digital illustration of a hacker in a blue sweatshirt.Source: ShutterstockAn American-Israeli multinational provider of software and combined hardware and software products, Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP) ranks as one of the most relevant names among the best cybersecurity stocks. Per its public profile, Check Point’s services include solutions for network, endpoint, cloud, mobile, and data security. Since the start of the year, CHKP just dipped a bit below parity.Still, on a relative basis, the red ink could signal an undervalued opportunity among July cybersecurity stock picks. While the underlying space isn’t bulletproof – no sector is – cybercriminals aren’t exactly letting up on their dubious activities. As the world becomes more connected, it’s almost inevitable that digital threats will increase. Check Point stays on top of the threat profile, making it a worthwhile contender.Another benefit to consider with CHKP is the underlying financial stability. According to investment resource Gurufocus, the company incurs zero debt, affording it flexibility. Also, it’s an operationally efficient enterprise, featuring a Piotroski F-Score of 7 out of 9.Fortinet (FTNT)a faceless figure wearing a hoodie surrounded by lines of codeSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Sunnyvale, California, Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) develops and sells security solutions like firewalls, endpoint security, and intrusion detection systems. As nefarious activity online only increases in scope and scale, FTNT easily makes a case for the best cybersecurity stocks. Since the beginning of this year, FTNT skyrocketed to nearly 54%. Over the trailing year, shares gained almost 27%.For the time being, Fortinet lost much of its vigor, especially when borrowing costs spiked throughout 2022. However, the market may have been irrational during this period. It’s not as if cybercriminals stopped their activities. In fact, Forbes pointed out that the victim count of data breaches increased to over 422 million in 2022, up 128 million from the prior year.Financially, a major drawback to FTNT is its value proposition (or lack thereof). Right now, shares trade at a forward multiple of 51.76. While that’s quite elevated compared to the median 28.26 times in the software industry, the specific relevance tied to Fortinet makes it one of the best ideas for investing in cybersecurity.Palo Alto Networks (PANW)Cybersecurity StocksSource: ShutterstockOne of the top names among the best cybersecurity stocks, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) offers myriad services in digital security. In particular, its core product involves a platform that includes advanced firewalls and cloud-based offerings that extend said firewalls to cover other avenues related to security. Thanks to its extraordinarily relevant profile, PANW gained nearly 84% of its equity value.Fundamentally, Palo Alto cynically benefits due to the costs associated with cyberattacks. For example, a 2019 CNBC article mentioned that digital breaches cost companies $200,000 on average. Sadly, such a heavy toll often puts many of these smaller enterprises out of business. Worryingly, the impact could be even greater now because of the “forced” digitalization following Covid-19 (i.e. remote work).Now, the blistering performance of PANW comes at a cost. Per Gurufocus, PANW trades at a trailing multiple of 404.19. Against forward earnings, it trades at 52.08 times. Either way, we’re talking about incredibly rich premiums. Still, the rising demand profile means that PANW is worth consideration for July cybersecurity stock picks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.
