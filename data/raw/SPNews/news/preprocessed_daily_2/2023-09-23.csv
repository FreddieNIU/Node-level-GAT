4,cdfcf6a6-e036-3193-8306-cdd949f51e3c,SCHW,2023-09-23,4 Crypto Stocks to Watch as Fed Keeps Interest Rates Intact,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-crypto-stocks-watch-fed-120000317.html,1695384000,STORY,"['HOOD', 'NVDA', 'COIN', 'ACN', 'SCHW']","[The Federal Reserve left its policy interest rate unchanged, as widely expected, in its September meeting. However, all three major indexes declined as the Fed hinted at another rate hike this year as concerns grew that inflationary pressures will prove to be stubborn.The cryptocurrency market also suffered following the announcement. Cryptocurrencies have been suffering lately after staging a solid rebound this year that saw Bitcoin (BTC) trading past $31,500 at the beginning of July.However, things have changed drastically since then, and Bitcoin hovered around the $26,600 mark on Sep 21.The Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes have been affecting markets for more than two-and-a-half years now. This took its toll on all major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC).Despite the pressure, cryptocurrencies rallied in the first half of 2022 due to a number of positive developments in the space.In 2023, a pivotal event in the Bitcoin ecosystem was a major legal victory in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, involving Grayscale and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The court ruled in favor of Grayscale in its lawsuit against the SEC, which had previously denied the company's application to transform the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).This ruling stands as a major victory for Grayscale and sets a precedent that could have far-reaching implications for other companies aspiring to launch Bitcoin ETFs, including prominent industry players.Moreover, the growing interest in cryptocurrencies within the financial sector is expected to propel the prices of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the coming months. Notably, financial giants like BlackRock, Inc. BLK are advocating regulatory approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF, a move that has the potential to increase retail investor participation significantly.Similarly, The Charles Schwab Corporation SCHW is backing a new exchange named EDX Markets, underlining the expanding institutional interest in the crypto space. These collective developments signal a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional finance and could contribute to a favorable trajectory for the overall cryptocurrency market.Top of FormStory continuesThe Fed’s recent decision to keep interest rates unchanged, however, didn’t lift investors' sentiments because the central bank hinted at another rate hike this year.Then again, the Fed also said that it would end its monetary tightening campaign in November and start cutting rates in 2024. This definitely bodes well for cryptocurrencies.Historically, the price of Bitcoin has exhibited a notable correlation with the performance of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 stock index. This correlation exists because both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies are considered to be relatively risky assets, leading investors to respond in a similar manner when evaluating their investment strategies based on prevailing market conditions.Thus, a pause in rate hikes bodes well for the cryptocurrency market in the near term.Stocks in FocusRobinhood Markets, Inc.

6,8d19d864-e14b-39fb-88e1-33a7f4edeaa2,TXN,2023-09-23,Investors Heavily Search Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-texas-instruments-130007314.html,1695387607,STORY,['TXN'],"[Texas Instruments (TXN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this chipmaker have returned -3.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.4% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Texas Instruments belongs, has lost 10.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Texas Instruments is expected to post earnings of $1.82 per share, indicating a change of -25.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.34 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -21.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.89 indicates a change of +7.4% from what Texas Instruments is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Texas Instruments is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Texas Instruments, the consensus sales estimate of $4.57 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -12.9%. The $18.03 billion and $19.38 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -10% and +7.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTexas Instruments reported revenues of $4.53 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -13.1%. EPS of $1.87 for the same period compares with $2.45 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.03%. The EPS surprise was +6.25%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Texas Instruments is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Texas Instruments. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 5 Stocks.In the ever-fluctuating landscape of global financial markets, recent developments have brought both optimism and uncertainty to investors worldwide. While Asian markets generally witnessed a trend of declines, an intriguing and notable exception emerged in the form of a robust rally in Chinese stocks. This unexpected surge in Chinese equities ran counter to the prevailing regional sentiment, with stock markets in Japan, Australia, and South Korea experiencing declines. Meanwhile, in the realm of global bond markets, the 10-year Treasury yield, a key indicator closely monitored by financial analysts, touched a significant milestone by reaching 4.5%, a level not seen since 2007. This milestone reflects the evolving dynamics of global interest rates. Furthermore, amidst these market movements, the Japanese Yen faced a weakening trend after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained its rates and guidance unchanged. Notably, the buoyancy in Chinese stocks was underscored by a particular focus on the technology sector, with the Hang Seng Tech index surging by as much as 2.6%. This intriguing blend of market dynamics paints a vivid picture of the ongoing intricacies within the financial world, where regional disparities, global bond market shifts, and central bank decisions all play pivotal roles in shaping investment landscapes. The recent turbulence in financial markets has left traders grappling with a rapidly unfolding reality. This week, major exchange-traded funds (ETFs) monitoring stocks, bonds, and commodities have all witnessed a significant sell-off, marking their first simultaneous week of losses in a month. Over four trading sessions, each of these ETFs has recorded at least 0.8% declines. This synchronized downturn is currently tracking as the third most substantial weekly loss since October, underscoring the challenging terrain investors are navigating as they adjust to the Federal Reserve's outlook, which anticipates elevated borrowing costs persisting for an extended period.Story continuesOil prices rebounded, mitigating a weekly loss primarily triggered by the Federal Reserve's announcement of a potential increase in US interest rates this year. This Fed update has subdued enthusiasm for risk assets and somewhat overshadowed the tangible supply constraints within the crude oil market. On September 22, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil surpassed the $90 per barrel mark, helping to narrow the weekly decline to less than 1%. The Fed's indication that borrowing costs are likely to remain elevated for an extended period has provided support for the US dollar, which, in turn, has diminished the appeal of commodities, including crude oil. Additionally, technical factors suggested that oil's recent price increases might have been excessive, contributing to the retracement in prices. The oil market remains a dynamic arena, where the interplay of market fundamentals, central bank policies, and technical analysis shapes price movements.On the Asian side, Singapore has overtaken Hong Kong as the world's freest economy, as reported by the Canadian think tank Fraser Institute. This marks a historic shift, as Hong Kong, which had held the top spot since the inception of the Economic Freedom of the World Index in 1970, has now fallen to second place, and its score is expected to decline further. The index evaluates economic freedom based on factors such as ease of international trade, market competition, and business regulations. The 2023 report is based on 2021 data, measuring individuals' economic freedom, or their ability to make independent economic decisions. According to Fraser Institute's senior fellow, Matthew Mitchell, this shift in Hong Kong's ranking reflects the close link between economic freedom and civil and political freedom. Hong Kong's decline is attributed to new regulatory barriers, rising business costs, and restrictions on foreign labor, which have curtailed economic freedom and could impact its prosperity. In contrast, Singapore climbed to the top spot from second place in the previous year, driven by improvements in its government size and regulation components. Switzerland, New Zealand, and the United States occupy the third, fourth, and fifth positions, respectively. The United Kingdom ranks ninth, with Japan and Germany in the 20th and 23rd positions, respectively. These findings shed light on the evolving landscape of economic freedom globally and its potential consequences for economic prosperity and civil liberties.On the stock market front, analysts are bearish on several stocks by trimming their price targets.

However, despite a turbulent environment and concerns over regulatory capital ratios, the bank is making strides in improving its financial position.Earlier this week, U.S. Bancorp was highlighted for its unusual operating income growth potential relative to peer banks amid the banking sector meltdown triggered by Silicon Valley Bank's failure. Despite the market's focus on survival and capital requirements, the bank's share price experienced an almost 30% decline, one of the most severe amongst its peers.In response to the Federal Reserve's new capital rules unveiled on July 27, U.S. Bancorp and other banks are required to hold more capital than before, reducing their earnings potential. Despite pushback from several bank CEOs and Congress, it remains unclear whether these rules will undergo significant revision.Specifically for U.S. Bancorp, management is currently working on building capital in anticipation of becoming a “Category II” bank. They aim to increase their Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio to 9.0% by year-end from around 8.5%. Measures taken include meaningful risked asset sales ($8.6B in Q2’23) and issuing 24M common shares to Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial (MUFJ) to settle some of its debt obligations to Union Bank’s former parent as part of their purchase agreement.These efforts appear to be paying off as U.S. Bancorp is now ahead of schedule and likely to end FY’24 with a CET1 ratio of 8.7% under Category II rules, meeting management’s target for 2024. This progress may allow the bank to avoid taking further earnings-compromising steps to reach its capital targets and potentially raise capital returns to shareholders sooner than expected.However, current operating conditions remain difficult. Despite the Federal Reserve's decision to hold steady on rates, deposit rates continue to climb. This has led to a modest decline in average deposits for U.S. Bancorp in the second quarter (down almost 3%), with non-interest-bearing deposits declining more than 12% and rising deposit costs pushing up the bank’s deposit beta.Story continuesMeanwhile, loan growth is slowing across the industry, with the latest Fed data showing 2% year-over-year growth in lending among large banks. In response, management has already reduced guidance a few times this year and recently indicated net interest income towards the lower end of the range.Despite these challenges, U.S. Bancorp is focusing on opportunities to drive core earnings leverage over the next couple of years, centered on Union Bank. These include cross-selling to the bank's large consumer and small business customer base and post-merger cost savings. The bank's exposure to payments could also prove beneficial if the U.S. economy performs better than expected.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

As Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan recently said, making a healthcare purchase is ""not like buying a toaster. It really can be life or death.""And patients are a captive market in the largely opaque and insular health industry, where prices are often hidden and there's little transparency about the process available for patients.Best Buy (BBY), for example, has a health segment that started making moves more than five years ago, with a focus on tech platforms and device providers that cater to the needs of patients in their homes. The company acquired Current Health, which provides at-home technology, patient monitoring, and healthcare services, in 2022 for $400 million.Geek Squad agents provide in-home and remote support as well as a support line for device and connectivity questions.Best Buy previously acquired GreatCall, an emergency response service for older patients, for $800 million in 2018. That deal gave BestBuy 900,000 subscribers to add to its customer base.Since then, the retailer has announced partnerships with hospital systems that tie the at-home care with access to Geek Squad — the retailer's longtime technology support service, which will help patients use and troubleshoot their new medical devices.The company also launched spaces in 40 stores nationwide last year that allow for customers to experience new devices — including non-healthcare devices. That includes testing out treadmills, smart refrigerators, hearing aids, and the like.Story continuesBest Buy has seen success linking Geek Squad with patients at Atrium Health and Geisinger Health, two large health systems in the country, and recently announced ramping up its relationship with Geisinger.But the company maintains it is only interested in being a partner that provides the technology support, rather than moving into the health provider space as other retailers like Walmart (WMT), with its health centers, and Amazon (AMZN), with its primary care One Medical acquisition, have done. ""We are not looking to provide care; we want to make the process of receiving care at home easier by doing what we do best: bringing consumers the technology they need and to age, receive care and remain well in their homes,"" said Deborah Di Sanzo, president of Best Buy Health, in an emailed response to Yahoo Finance.""Traditional retail does play a role, especially when our large store footprint allows us to reach so many people. Seventy percent of Americans live within 10 minutes of a Best Buy,"" Di Sanzo said.And the company is leveraging that footprint to provide interactive displays that can help customers become familiar with newer technology for at-home care.So could you see mobility scooters in a Best Buy near you?""In these stores you would indeed see new categories .... next to traditional tech customers love to see from Best Buy like TVs, but in addition to that, you’d also see an interactive display of over-the-counter hearing aids, expanded health and wellness areas with tons of new and innovative products,"" Di Sanzo said.All of this is taking place as retailers undergo a transformation period, as more shopping is done online putting less demand on larger-footprint stores. But it isn't just retailers giving rise to big box medicine — that is, healthcare in a consumer-friendly format.GE Healthcare (GEHC), which spun off into an independent company this year, has been a longtime player in medical devices for hospital use. But it sees opportunity in the at-home space, with portable devices sold through retailers, as well as providing the hospital-grade devices a retail clinic might need.Catherine Estrampes, US and Canada CEO for GE Healthcare, told Yahoo Finance at-home care is a big topic for the company.""There will be more demand for in-the-home, or in retail spaces, access to technology — to simple, new technology. There is always going to be a lot of demand for inpatient and clinics. But I think, if you look at the market structure today, the Walmarts and CVSs (CVS), they are making big moves into the market,"" Estrampes said.One of the ideas Estrampes shared could be adding mammograms to retail health sites at a CVS or a Walmart. For example, imagine being in a retail store, and before you do your shopping, you get a mammogram with a health provider at the on-site clinic.The company has also launched a handheld ultrasound device, Vscan Air, which can be used both for the maternity care market, but also has benefits for rural markets in the US and globally. To compliment the handheld use, GE Healthcare acquired Caption Health earlier this year, which is an AI platform that could help guide a medical professional in using a handheld ultrasound device.The company also invested in Pulsenmore, an at-home ultrasound system that expectant mothers can use.That could reduce the burden of multiple doctor's visits that maternal care requires — making the process easier for both patient and provider, especially if data can be transmitted to the doctor or health system, Estrampes said.Data is key in this scenario, so having healthcare partners linked through electronic medical records could become an important avenue to having better health outcomes for patients, Estrampes said.But there's another benefit: It can also help GE Healthcare build better products.""The data is totally linked to the development of insights, so that we can develop predictive analytics to detect early and treat earlier,"" Estrampes said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Retail health care is a growing area of interest for many traditional retailers. But most are in the early stages of figuring out where they can make money. GE Health Care is looking at consumer medical devices while some of the big box retailers like Walmart and even Best Buy are looking for ways to get a piece of the $4 trillion health care pie. Yahoo finance's Anjalee Khemlani has more on this story for us, Anj.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right, Seana. You, of course, know the players that are in the retail health care space thinking of CVS, Walmart, and Walgreens who have been increasingly providing provider services or checkups. But now, we're starting to see, really, a growth in demand for things like medical devices especially as more care gets put in the home. And that's where companies like Best Buy and GE are starting to take a look at where they can play.Best Buy, for example, in a recent interview told me that they are looking at bringing some of those medical devices into the stores, taking advantage of their big footprint as well as Geek Squad as support for these individuals, especially catering to seniors and the like. So they're talking about you know putting, for example, scooters in the stores, and hearing aids as well, especially as they're starting to roll out what they're calling Experience Stores, so where you get to try the product. That's something that's really been a focus for them.They've already been building out their health department which is something that has been sort of quietly working on deals since about 2017. $1.2 billion already invested in some of these deals for tech platforms or at-home device companies, Geek Squad, like I mentioned, to help the seniors, and those Experience Stores.Story continuesAnd I thought it was quite interesting. And so I asked, well, what else could we expect? What kinds of products do we anticipate rolling out, things that could be used by the elderly.And I got that part from the president of Best Buy Health saying, quote, ""You would indeed see new categories like electric scooters, next to traditional tech customers love to see from Best Buy like TVs."" But in addition to that, they have the interactive over-the-counter hearing aids which we know is a recent progress from Medicare. So all of these things coming together.Meanwhile, GE, you think about them as just a retail product maker for a long time, right, and appliances? But they're also pretty big in the medical device space. And they, too, are starting to see this trend develop.And looking at where they get to play a role, so they've been doing stuff like creating handheld at-home devices. They recently acquired a company called Caption Health which helps with AI guiding for those, say, like an ultrasound machine, a portable ultrasound machine. And that could really put these products in consumers' hands.And they're looking at partnerships with some of these retailers. One of the things that I was told was, you know, think about maybe getting a mammogram while you're at Walmart or CVS? You know, why not? So there's certainly opportunity. And you're starting to see the segment really take off now.BRAD SMITH: All right. Anjalee, thank you so much for tracking all of that, continuing to keep it on our radars as well. Yahoo Finance's own Anjalee Khemlani, appreciate it.]"

Gallagher has an impressive inorganic story with buyouts made in the Brokerage and Risk Management segments. This insurance broker acquired 25 entities in the first half of 2023, which contributed about $418 million to estimated annualized revenues. AJG has a strong merger and acquisition pipeline with about $300 million of revenues, associated with about 55 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared, representing more than $700 million of annualized revenues.A solid capital position supports this insurance broker in its growth initiatives and it thus remains focused on continuing its tuck-in mergers and acquisitions.

A cybercriminal impersonated an MGM employee using information found on a LinkedIn post. The criminal then contacted the company's IT department requesting a password reset.

One such stock that merits attention is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE:NCLH). The stock, which is currently priced at 16.52, recorded a loss of 2.39% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 13.47%. The stock's fair valuation is $60.85, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NCLH. Click here to check it out. NCLH 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NCLHThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:1. Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.2. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.3. Future estimates of the business performance.If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Investing in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH): Navigating the Thin Line Between Value and TrapHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of -0.21, and the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years, which raises a crucial question: Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings a hidden gem or a value trap?Altman Z-score: A Measure of Financial HealthBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings: A Company OverviewNorwegian Cruise Line is the world's third-largest cruise company by berths (at more than 60,000), operating 30 ships across three brands (Norwegian, Oceania, and Regent Seven Seas), offering both freestyle and luxury cruising. The company had redeployed its entire fleet as of May 2022. With seven passenger vessels on order among its brands through 2028 (representing 19,000 incremental berths), Norwegian is increasing capacity faster than its peers, expanding its brand globally. Norwegian sails to around 700 global destinations.Investing in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH): Navigating the Thin Line Between Value and TrapLow Altman Z-Score: A Warning SignA dissection of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's Altman Z-score reveals Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's historical data, 2021: -0.13; 2022: -0.33; 2023: -0.38, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.Declining Revenues and Earnings: A Bearish IndicatorOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, both the revenue per share (evident from the last five years' TTM data: 2019: 28.67; 2020: 21.68; 2021: 0.08; 2022: 5.74; 2023: 16.54; ) and the 5-year revenue growth rate (-32%) have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's products, or escalating competition in its market sector. Either scenario can pose serious risks to the company's future performance, warranting a thorough analysis by investors.Investing in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH): Navigating the Thin Line Between Value and TrapThe Red Flag: Sluggish Earnings GrowthDespite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. A low price relative to intrinsic value can indeed suggest an investment opportunity, but only if the company's fundamentals are sound or improving. In Steelcase's case, the declining revenues, EBITDA, and earnings growth suggest that the company's issues may be more than just cyclical fluctuations.Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity.Conclusion: A Potential Value TrapBased on the analysis, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings appears to be a potential value trap. Despite its seemingly undervalued status, the company's declining revenues and earnings, coupled with its low Altman Z-score, suggest possible financial distress. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .Investors can find stocks with good revenue and earnings growth using GuruFocus' Peter Lynch Growth with Low Valuation Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The company's Earnings Per Share (EPS) stood at 11.54. But does this performance justify its current valuation? Let's delve into a comprehensive analysis of Gartner's intrinsic value.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MPWR. Click here to check it out. IT 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ITHeadquartered in Stamford, Conn., Gartner Inc (NYSE:IT) is a leading provider of independent research and analysis on information technology and other related technology industries. Gartner's research is primarily delivered to clients in the form of reports, briefings, and updates. The company's clientele mainly consists of chief information officers and other business executives who help plan companies' IT budgets. In addition to its research services, Gartner also offers consulting services and hosts IT conferences globally.Unveiling Gartner (IT)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that estimates a stock's intrinsic value. It is calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the stock's fair trading value. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock is likely overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if the stock price is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return is likely to be higher.Valuation AnalysisAccording to GuruFocus Value calculation, Gartner (NYSE:IT) appears to be fairly valued. The stock's current price is $356.26 per share, with a market cap of $28.10 billion. This suggests that the stock is trading close to our estimate of its fair value. As Gartner is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Story continuesUnveiling Gartner (IT)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideFinancial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding to invest in its stock. Gartner's cash-to-debt ratio is 0.39, which is lower than 79.03% of 2752 companies in the Software industry. GuruFocus ranks Gartner's overall financial strength at 6 out of 10, indicating that its financial strength is fair.Unveiling Gartner (IT)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially if the company has demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. Gartner has been profitable 10 years over the past 10 years and reported revenues of $5.70 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $11.54 in the past 12 months. Its operating margin of 19.99% is better than 89.02% of 2787 companies in the Software industry. GuruFocus ranks Gartner's profitability as strong.The long-term stock performance of a company is closely correlated with growth. Faster-growing companies create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. Gartner's average annual revenue growth is 13.1%, which is better than 61.75% of 2413 companies in the Software industry. The company's 3-year average EBITDA growth is 36.8%, which is better than 82.61% of 2007 companies in the Software industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is another way to assess its profitability. The ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. Ideally, the ROIC should be higher than the WACC. For the past 12 months, Gartner's ROIC is 12.86, and its WACC is 10.25.Unveiling Gartner (IT)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionIn summary, the stock of Gartner (NYSE:IT) appears to be fairly valued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong.

The area hosts industries as varied as steelmaking and paper production and accounts for one quarter of Wales’ total carbon emissions and about 5pc of total UK emissions – meaning that if the country is to decarbonise, so must Milford Haven.The groundwork is already being laid for a major overhaul.RWE operates the Pembroke Power Station on the south side of the waterway. The facility is currently one of the largest and most efficient gas power stations in Europe. But within the next two years, bosses will have to make key decisions about its future.“If you just carried on with business-as-usual, then effectively you would have to close on December 31, 2034,” says Roland Long, site manager of Pembroke Power Station. “So you ask yourself, what are the options?”Roland Long, site manager of Pembroke Power StationRWE is considering turning the power station green by capturing direct emissions from its gas-fired units and storing them. The emissions would have to be converted into liquified CO2 and then transported elsewhere – probably to be piped into emptied oil and gas reservoirs underneath the North Sea.Story continuesAt the same time, the German company is exploring the development of two “green” hydrogen production plants where electrolysers would convert water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity.It is also looking at the possibility of an on-site battery storage plant. And land has been set aside for a separate, “blue” hydrogen facility where natural gas would be combined with steam to produce hydrogen.All options are on the table.“We’ve got engineers here working on this right now,” says Long. “What do we need if we do carbon capture? How would we actually extend the life of this plant? It’s about the absolute details, so it’s quite an exciting time for people to work in the power industry.”The oil and chemical tanker Bro Deliverer sits moored on the quayside at Milford Haven waterway - Ben Stansall / AFPHydrogen could potentially allow neighbouring facilities such as the Valero oil refinery, capable of producing 270,000 barrels of oil per day, to decarbonise jobs that involve heating. Instead of natural gas, hydrogen could be used to power industrial processes.However, significant parts of the investment case for projects in Milford Haven depend on other projects being developed elsewhere.For example, the green electricity that will power RWE’s electrolysers is expected to come from new floating wind farms off the coast in the Celtic Sea. The Crown Estate estimates there is potential for 20 gigawatts of capacity out there - equivalent to roughly 1,000 skyscraper-sized turbines.But in the Government’s latest renewable subsidies auction, no bids were received by offshore wind farm developers because the prices offered were too low. That puts a question mark over Milford Haven’s green energy supply.There will also need to be new infrastructure built to transport the hydrogen across South Wales.The Valero Pembroke Refinery in Milford Haven - Matthew Horwood/GettySarah Williams, director of asset strategy at gas network operator Wales &amp; West Utilities, says her company is currently exploring plans for an 80-mile steel pipeline called HyLine Cymru.But the project cannot go ahead without guarantees that there will be both production of hydrogen locally and - most crucially - willing customers.“This would be a major project to support industry,” Williams says. “But there’s clearly no point in building a pipeline if we can’t confirm the hydrogen is going to be available to go through it or if there are no customers who are going to use it.”Some of the demand is expected to come from transport. South Wales Transport is currently trialling buses that use hydrogen fuel cells, for example.However, a string of big industrial users must sign up for the sums to stack up.Against that backdrop, a recent decision by Tata Steel to wind down its coal-fired blast furnaces in Port Talbot and replace them with electric arc systems has delivered a blow.The change means the end of steel production from ore at the plant, a process which could have been done using hydrogen instead of fossil fuels. The factory is instead switching to using scrap metal to make recycled steel, a process that will be powered by electricity likely generated by nearby wind farms.The busy Pembroke dock and the oil and gas terminals at Milford Haven - Phillip Roberts / AlamyMeanwhile, the port of Milford Haven is busy upgrading its own infrastructure in preparation for what it predicts will be a wind power boom. Changes include new “laydown” areas to make it easier for companies to work on large components such as turbine towers and blades, as well as “super slipways” to help transport the parts.While the recent government auction failed to generate any bids for offshore wind projects, Sawyer believes future rounds are bound to yield results given the potential of the Celtic Sea.“You’ve got more than 1,000, very, very large turbines going up,” Sawyer adds. “They’ll need businesses that can make anchors, chains, cabling, so you need welders, fabricators and mechanical and electrical engineers - there’s just this enormous opportunity.”Combined plans could inject £6bn into local economyEven if Port Talbot won’t be using hydrogen for its electric arc furnaces, Sawyer argues the recycled steel the plant will produce should be suitable for making the wind turbines.“I actually see the steel announcement at Port Talbot as fantastic, because that was always going to be the long pole in the tent.”The port of Milford Haven has applied for grant funding from the Government to help finance the work.

The bank cited lower OPEC output combined with higher demand, which taken together, ""more than offset significantly higher U.S. supply.""The average gas price in the U.S. on September 20 was $3.875, slightly lower than a day earlier but $0.20 higher than a year ago.Even with higher gas prices, EV purchases have slowed down instead of rising.In Europe, the deindustrialization of Germany is no longer news, the car industry is bracing for a Chinese EV rush, and Brussels is trying to build an energy transition supply chain from scratch.Meanwhile, offshore wind developers are canceling projects in both Europe and the U.S., solar developers in the EU are complaining about cheap Chinese panels.Also meanwhile, oil and gas companies keep reporting meaty profits and investors are rediscovering their love of hydrocarbons.The energy transition is backfiring.At the recent World Petroleum Congress in Calgary, oil executives and government officials both warned against the continued push to discourage investment in new hydrocarbon production.""There seems to be wishful thinking that we're going to flip a switch from where we're at today to where it will be tomorrow,"" Exxon's chief executive said during the event.""No matter where demand gets to, if we don't maintain some level of investment industry, you end up running shorter supply which leads to higher prices,"" Darren Woods also said.This is exactly what we are currently witnessing in Europe and the United States. Because of the transition push, oil producers are being extra cautious with production growth. Also, they are prioritizing shareholder returns to keep shareholders on, so it pays for them to be cautious.In Europe, the supermajors are being squeezed by windfall profit taxes, activist pressure, and increasingly restrictive legislation, so they are turning elsewhere. Shell is tapping billions of potential barrels in Namibia, and Total is considering a $9-billion commitment to oil exploration in Suriname.Story continuesMeanwhile, drivers across Europe are struggling with higher fuel costs and higher electricity bills as the EU becomes increasingly dependent on intermittent wind and solar that need backup from hydrocarbon-fueled power plants. These plants are taxed heavily for their carbon emissions, which has pushed the cost of their output—and electricity bills—higher.All of this is only going to get worse before it gets better. Because despite a growing number of signs that the transition is not going according to plan, those in the driver's seat are doubling down on every single commitment.The offshore wind energy industry is essentially on its deathbed, yet there has been no change of attitude from governments. The most likely thing they would do about its problems will probably be even more subsidies instead of a reconsideration of the role offshore wind would play in the transition.In EVs, dealers are struggling with rising inventories in the U.S., and Ford said recently it was going to book a $4.5 billion loss on its EV business. In Europe, sales are up strongly, but carmakers are fretting about Chinese EVs, which are just as good as theirs but cheaper.Solar energy is doing great in the U.S., set for record growth of 32 GW this year, ""helped by investment incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act,"" Reuters reported recently. It appears nobody really cares what happens when the sun goes down over all those gigawatts. Battery storage is far behind solar in terms of capacity.Solar is doing great in the EU, too, also thanks to heavy subsidies, only there is a shortage of qualified installers, and local panel producers are grumbling against Chinese imports that are, according to the industry, killing them.So the EU recently essentially declared a selective trade war on China through the mouth of EC president Ursula von der Leyen. China warned there would be consequences—at a time when the country has become a major exporter of fuels to Europe thanks to the Russian fuel embargo.The price of energy is going to continue higher in both Europe and the U.S. All because of an ill-conceived transition away from hydrocarbons.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Oil And Gas Workers’ Association Endorses Trump For 2024 VoteChinese Fuel Oil Imports Continue To Dip From Decade-HighNigeria Secures $13 Billion In Investment Pledges From Big OilRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Rates that high are bound to spark more pain for small firms, he said, which are already suffering from what O'Leary calls a ""cash crisis"" amid a higher cost of borrowing.""That's going to really hurt small businesses,"" O'Leary said. He previously estimated that small businesses employ 60% of the US workforce.Central bankers have raised interest rates aggressively over the past 18 months to control inflation, with rates now at their highest level since 2001. Prices are still well-above the Fed's 2% target, with inflation accelerating to 3.7% year-over-year in August, per the latest Consumer Price Index report.Part of that is due to higher energy prices, which were the biggest driver of inflation last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Oil prices have stuck close to a 10-month high, with Brent crude the international benchmark, trading around $94 a barrel on Friday while West Texas Intermediate crude traded around $91 a barrel..O'Leary blamed high oil prices on a systemic shortage of crude production. The US is producing around 12 million  barrels of crude a day, though demand will likely require that to rise to 18 million barrels a day, O'Leary estimated. That will need to be resolved by producing more barrels in addition to more oil refineries, which process crude into products like diesel and gasoline.Story continues""This is not brain surgery,"" he said. ""We have to do this or we're going to be in real trouble in three years on the whole oil issue.""Forecasters have warned that oil prices could go even higher through the end of the year as supply cuts from producers in OPEC+ could deepen. More supply pressure could potentially push Brent crude up to $120 a barrel, JPMorgan strategists warned, a level that could push inflation higher and bring economic growth to a halt in coming quarters.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

A planned expansion of its Zohr gas field and new exploration projects are expected to put Egypt back on the map for its energy resources. Further, investment in innovative technologies is expected to boost production rates.Earlier this year, Egypt experienced a sharp drop in its oil and gas exports. Its production of oil has been falling over the last decade, from a high of 930,000 bpd in 1996 to 580,000 bpd in 2020. Egypt’s natural gas output fell from 7.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2009 to approximately 6.5 bcfd in 2020. This is largely due to the country’s reliance on ageing oil and gas fields, with little investment in new exploration activities in recent years.Egypt’s gas output looked more positive following Eni’s discovery of the massive Zohr gas field in 2015. However, there have been few major discoveries since. In July, the ratings agency Fitch revised its forecast for Egypt's gas production in 2023, anticipating a decline of 4 percent from its previous 1 percent year-on-year growth forecast. It blamed this largest on the high depletion rates of the country’s existing oil and gas fields, such as those in the Western Desert, West Delta Deep Marine and onshore fields in the Nile Delta.Egypt’s gasoline exports declined in value between January and February this year, according to the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS). Meanwhile, crude exports dropped by 58.8 percent to $243 million in January and February this year, compared to $590 million in the same period last year, and the value of natural and liquified gas fell by 12.2 percent.In August, Israel agreed to increase its exports of natural gas to Egypt from the offshore Tamar field, according to Energy Minister Israel Katz. This is expected to “increase the state’s revenue and strengthen diplomatic ties between Israel and Egypt”, stated Katz. The demand for gas in Egypt has been growing, while its domestic gas production has fallen. Egypt’s gas output dropped by 9 percent year-on-year between January and May. This has led to power shortages during heatwaves, which drove up demand.Story continuesKatz approved the exports of any surplus gas once the national demand of Israel has been met. While Israel holds substantial offshore gas deposits, the government has set a limit on how much of its gas can be exported, to ensure Israel’s domestic needs are being met. In 2022, just 325.25 bcf of Israel’s 751.9 bcf gas production went to Egypt and Jordan.Despite difficulties in meeting the country’s energy demands, Egypt has big plans for its oil and gas industry in the coming years. In July, Egypt approved three binding oil and gas agreements for the drilling of multiple exploration wells at a reported value of $319 billion. This includes two projects searching for oil and gas in the Mediterranean Sea and one project to search for oil west of the Gulf of Suez. The North African state has plans to drill 35 exploration wells in total in the next two years, at a projected cost of $1.8 billion. The wells will be drilled by Eni, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and BP.This month, the government announced plans to expand the Zohr gas field, which will include the drilling of multiple new wells in 2024 and 2025. This comes as part of the government’s strategy to strengthen Egypt’s energy sector. Egypt hopes this expansion will help meet its growing domestic energy needs and is committed to new research and exploration activities.Egypt’s Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Tarek El-Molla, highlighted the importance of the partnership between Petrobel, a subsidiary of the Egyptian General Petroleum Corp., and the Italian energy company Eni in Egypt’s oil and gas industry. He emphasised the need to ramp up drilling activities as well as to develop and roll out innovative technologies to improve production rates. Petrobel’s Chairman Khaled Mowafi announced that the company’s production of gas, oil, condensates and butane totalled 93 million barrels of oil equivalent in the past year. Meanwhile, investments in the exploration, development, and operation of gas and oil fields amounted to approximately $737 million.While Egypt remains highly dependent on gas imports to meet its growing national energy demand, it expects to develop its domestic resources substantially over the coming decades. The Egyptian General Petroleum Corp and several international oil majors are expected to invest heavily in exploration activities to help boost the country’s oil and gas output to improve energy security, supported by the funding of innovative technologies expected to further drive up production.By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:Libya's Oil And Gas Rebound At Risk After Historic StormDetroit's Auto Giants Reel As UAW Strikes Bite HardBiden Met With Central Asian Leaders To Discuss Trade And DevelopmentRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

By the end of trading, the stock had rallied to close at Rs 146 per share, marking a 16% increase over the IPO price of Rs 126.The hotel company is a key player in India's hotel industry, holding the third-largest inventory of operational keys (owned and leased) in the country as of February 2023. SAMHI Hotels' business model involves acquiring or constructing primary hotels and then renovating and rebranding them under its banner. The portfolio includes notable properties such as Hyatt Regency in Pune, Courtyard by Marriott in Bengaluru, Four Points by Sheraton Vizag, and Fairfield by Marriott among others.Despite its recent listing and strong portfolio, SAMHI Hotels has faced financial difficulties. Over the last three fiscal years, its financial performance has been subpar. In the year ending March, while the company doubled its revenue from operations to Rs 738 crore, it also reported a loss of Rs 338.5 crore during the same period.Given these financial results, analysts have advised investors who received allotments to consider booking profits on the listing day.

This was first reported by Reuters.Particularly, cities led by Baltimore, San Diego and Philadelphia accused Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs GS, JPMorgan Chase JPM, Morgan Stanley MS, Royal Bank of Canada and Wells Fargo &amp; Company WFC of colluding to raise interest rates on more than 12,000 variable-rate demand obligations (VRDOs) from 2008 to 2016.VRDOs are long-term bonds with short-term rates that reset weekly. Banks remarket VRDOs that investors redeem at the least rates. The banks were accused of conspiring to artificially increase rates by sharing information about bond inventories and planned rate changes.Resultantly, funding availability was reduced for hospitals, power and water supplies, schools and transportation, causing billions of dollars in damages.The banks filed an opposing class certification, noting that differences among the bonds would require many individual examinations to determine if rate inflation occurred. This would make a single class-action lawsuit difficult.But now, the U.S. district judge has rejected the banks’ certification to require cities to pursue claims individually, likely lowering probable recoveries.""Of course, it remains an open question whether, assuming plaintiffs paid supra-competitive interest, that payment was caused by defendants' allegedly anti-competitive behavior,"" Furman noted.Recently, a lawsuit was filed in the New York state court against Morgan Stanley by private equity firms Certares Management LLC and Knighthead Capital Management LLC. The firms claim that MS used deceptive practices in relation to a credit agreement investment for a luxury high-speed rail line.The firms are seeking at least $750 million in damages from Morgan Stanley.

The lawsuit pertains to a disputed $1bn margin call related to trades in Hugo Boss, which Frasers alleges was maintained ""arbitrarily"" and ""incorrectly"" by the bank.The lawsuit was first launched in 2021 after the bank tried to force Frasers to close options positions it had established in Hugo Boss. The retailer claims this action resulted in millions of dollars in losses. Frasers is seeking €50m ($58m) in damages to cover these losses.In May 2021, Morgan Stanley issued a margin call of £810 million ($1.1bn) on Saxo Bank, which was connected with certain put and call options in Hugo Boss that were ultimately held by Frasers. Saxo Bank attempted to pass the margin call onto Frasers, but the retailer obtained injunctive relief in June 2021, preventing the banks from taking any steps related to the margin call.Despite this, Ashley reportedly offered £100 million ($137m) and his entire £1.9 billion ($2.6bn) stake in Frasers as collateral to meet the margin call, an offer that was refused.Now, Frasers is demanding that Gorman, who has been at the helm of Morgan Stanley since 2010, testify and produce documents related to the case.

Price and ConsensusSalesforce Inc. price-consensus-chart | Salesforce Inc. QuoteSalesforce Bets on Generative AI for Long-Term GrowthSalesforce is currently focusing on incorporating generative AI tools across its products as it looks to keep its business ahead of rivals. Generative AI is a type of AI technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. It is driven by a large language model (LLM), which means it uses a lot of data to understand and generate conversations.The company forayed into the generative AI space with the launch of Einstein GPT in March 2023. Einstein GPT is the world’s first generative AI CRM technology, which delivers AI-created content across every sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT interaction at hyperscale. With Einstein GPT, the company will transform customer experience with generative AI.Story continuesUpping its ante in the space, CRM launched its AI Cloud service in June 2023, which the company claims is a one-stop AI-powered solution for enterprises looking to enhance productivity. Salesforce stated that its AI Cloud is a suite of services that delivers enterprise-ready real-time, open and secure generative experiences across all applications and workflows. The suite will power new capabilities across CRM’s products, including Einstein service, data analysis software Tableau and workplace-messaging app, Slack.Along with the launch of AI Cloud, the company also raised its venture capital fund for generative AI to $500 million from $250 million announced in March 2023. With this enhanced fund, Salesforce Ventures, the company’s global investment arm, will support the generative AI ecosystem and promote the development of responsible and trusted technology.Other Companies Integrating Generative AIGenerative AI technology is finding applications in marketing, advertising, drug development, legal contracts, video gaming, customer support and digital art.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. View our latest analysis for Salesforce How Much Debt Does Salesforce Carry?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Salesforce had US$9.42b of debt in July 2023, down from US$10.6b, one year before. But it also has US$12.4b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$2.97b net cash.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Salesforce's Balance Sheet?The latest balance sheet data shows that Salesforce had liabilities of US$20.8b due within a year, and liabilities of US$13.6b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$12.4b as well as receivables valued at US$5.40b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$16.6b.Of course, Salesforce has a titanic market capitalization of US$203.0b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Salesforce also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.Story continuesBetter yet, Salesforce grew its EBIT by 3,228% last year, which is an impressive improvement. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Salesforce can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. Salesforce may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Happily for any shareholders, Salesforce actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. There's nothing better than incoming cash when it comes to staying in your lenders' good graces.Summing UpWhile it is always sensible to look at a company's total liabilities, it is very reassuring that Salesforce has US$2.97b in net cash. The cherry on top was that in converted 339% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$7.6b. So we don't think Salesforce's use of debt is risky. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example - Salesforce has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Ralph Lauren's shares before the 28th of September to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 13th of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.75 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$3.00 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Ralph Lauren has a trailing yield of 2.7% on the current share price of $112.14. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Ralph Lauren's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately Ralph Lauren's payout ratio is modest, at just 38% of profit. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It distributed 48% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see Ralph Lauren has grown its earnings rapidly, up 33% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, Ralph Lauren has increased its dividend at approximately 6.5% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayShould investors buy Ralph Lauren for the upcoming dividend? Ralph Lauren has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past 10 years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Ralph Lauren is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Ralph Lauren you should know about.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Assuming, of course, that his moment has actually arrived.On Thursday, his father Rupert Murdoch announced that in November he'll step down as the head of his two media companies: News Corp. and Fox Corp. Lachlan will become the chair of News Corp. while remaining chief executive and chair at Fox Corp., the parent of Fox News Channel.The changes make Rupert's eldest son the undisputed leader of the media empire his father built over decades. There's no real sign that his siblings and former rivals James and Elisabeth contested him for the top job; James in particular has distanced himself from the company and his father's politics for several years. But Rupert, now 92, has long had a penchant for building up his oldest children only to later undermine them — and sometimes to set them against one another — often flipping the table without notice.Given Rupert Murdoch's advanced age, this might be his last power move. But there's a reason the HBO drama “ Succession ” was often interpreted as a thinly disguised and dark satire of his family business. In Murdoch World, as in the fictional world of the Roy family, seemingly sure things can go sideways in an instant, particularly when unexpected opportunities arise.Lachlan Murdoch has lived that first hand. Born in London, he grew up in New York City and attended Princeton, where he focused not on business, but philosophy. His bachelor's thesis, titled “A Study of Freedom and Morality in Kant's Practical Philosophy,” addressed those weighty topics alongside passages of Hindu scripture. The thesis closed on a line from the Bhagavad Gita referencing “the infinite spirit” and “the pure calm of infinity,” according to a 2019 article in The Intercept.Béatrice Longuenesse, Lachlan's thesis advisor at Princeton, confirmed the accuracy of that report via email.After graduation, though, Lachlan plunged headlong into his father's business, moving to Australia to work for the Murdoch newspapers that were once the core of News Corp.'s business. Many assumed he was being groomed for higher things at News Corp., and they were not wrong. Within just a few years, Lachlan was deputy CEO of the News Corp. holding company for its Australian properties; shortly thereafter, he took an executive position at News Corp. itself and was soon running the company's television stations and print publishing operations.Story continuesLachlan's ascent came to an abrupt halt in 2005, when he resigned from News Corp. with no public explanation. According to Paddy Manning, an Australian journalist who last year published a biography of Lachlan Murdoch, the core problem involved two relatively minor issues on which Lachlan disagreed with Roger Ailes, who then ran Fox News.“The real point was that Lachlan felt Rupert had backed his executives over his son,” Manning said in an interview. “So Lachlan felt, 'If I'm not going to be supported, then what's the point?'” Manning did not have direct access to Lachlan for his book “The Successor,” but said he spoke in depth with the people closest to his subject.Lachlan returned to Australia, where he has often described feeling most at home, and founded an investment group that purchased a string of local radio stations among other properties.While he was away, News Corp. entered choppy waters. The U.K. phone-hacking scandal, in which tabloid journalists at the News of the World and other Murdoch-owned publications had found a way to listen to voicemails of the British royal family, journalistic competitors and even a missing schoolgirl, had seriously damaged the company. The fracas led to resignations of several News Corp. officials, criminal charges against some, and the closure of News of the World as its finances went south.Manning said that the damage the scandal inflicted on News Corp. — and on both Lachlan Murdoch's father and his brother James, chief executive of News' British newspaper group at the time — helped pull Lachlan back to the company.“He was watching the family tear itself apart over the phone-hacking scandal,” Manning said. Lachlan was “instrumental in trying to circle the wagons and turn the guns outwards, and stop Rupert from sacking James.”While it took more convincing, Lachlan eventually returned to the company in 2014 as co-chairman of News Corp. alongside James.Not long afterward, Ailes was forced out of his job at Fox News following numerous credible allegations of sexual harassment.Lachlan Murdoch has drawn criticism from media watchdogs for what many called Fox News' increasingly conspiratorial and misinformation-promoting broadcasts. The network hit a nadir following the 2020 election when voting machine company Dominion Voting Systems sued Fox News for $1.6 billion, alleging that Fox knowingly promoted false conspiracy theories about the security of its voting machines.Fox settled that suit for $787.5 million in March of this year. A similar lawsuit filed by Smartmatic, another voting-machine maker, may go to trial in 2025, Fox has suggested.In certain respects, though, Lachlan Murdoch's behavior suggests some ambivalence about his role at News Corp. In 2021 he moved back to Sydney and has been mixing commuting and remote work from Australia ever since. “I think there’s a legitimate question about whether you can continue to do that and for how long” while running companies based in the U.S., Manning said.___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives funding from the Quadrivium foundation, founded by James and Kathryn Murdoch.

Born in London to Murdoch and his second wife, Anna, he grew up steeped in the media business. In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s “Dynasties” program, he said that every morning, before catching the school bus, he and his siblings would read the morning papers - The New York Post, The New York Times, the Daily News and the Wall Street Journal - with his father flagging stories of interest, ordering: “Read that.”The best way to capture their father’s attention in the evenings was to talk about media or politics, according to Paddy Manning’s 2022 biography, “The Successor.” As Lachlan Murdoch got older, he would spend summers working in the family business, cleaning the presses for Sydney’s “Daily Mirror,” or working as a cub reporter for the “San Antonio Express-News.”A rivalry between Lachlan and his younger brother, James, played out from an early age, where even family Monopoly games “were intense and everybody was prepared to cheat,” according to one published account.Lachlan Murdoch and his siblings attended Dalton, a private school on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, and other elite schools, including Trinity School, where he formed the Trinity Conservative Society, “In an attempt to create a healthy balance between all points of view,” according to one yearbook entry cited by Manning.Story continuesAfter graduating in 1994 from Princeton, where he majored in philosophy, he entered the family business, spending three years in Australia, ascending the corporate ladder to become chairman of News Limited.In 1999, Lachlan Murdoch assumed responsibility for print operations in the U.S. He rose to deputy chief operating officer at News Corp, overseeing the company’s U.S. television stations group and publishing assets, including the New York Post. Many saw him as being trained to assume the corporate reins as his father’s successor.He abruptly resigned in 2005, creating questions about who would succeed Rupert Murdoch at the helm of the media empire he had assembled from a single newspaper in Australia. Lachlan Murdoch founded Illyria Pty, a private investment company, whose acquisitions included a network of Australian radio stations. In 2015, he returned to the family business, sharing the title of co-chairman of 21st Century Fox with his brother, James.The sale of Fox’s entertainment assets to Walt Disney in 2019, in a $71-billion transaction, shrank the size of the Murdochs’ once-vast media holdings. The newly constituted Fox was reduced to a handful of assets, including the Fox broadcast network, Fox News, Fox Sports and Fox Business, with Lachlan Murdoch serving as its executive chair and chief executive officer.Brother James Murdoch left Fox with the close of the Disney transaction.As chief executive of Fox Corp since 2019, Lachlan Murdoch has presided over the media properties during seismic change in the industry, as viewers cut their cable subscriptions in favor of streaming services. Even so, Fox News has largely maintained its rating dominance, in part because of its appeal among politically conservative-leaning American viewers.Lachlan Murdoch doesn’t speak publicly about his politics, according to an article in the New York Times magazine, which cited the 2016 memoir ""Making Headlines,"" by Chris Mitchell, the longtime editor of The Australian, as describing “Lachlan’s conservatism is more vigorous than that of any Australian politician” and that his views were usually to the right of his father’s.A Fox spokesperson called that ""just speculation,"" adding ""I wouldn't want to put a label on him, but it wouldn't be unfair to categorize him as a conservative.""Fox’s loyalty to those viewers became a hot-button issue during discovery for Dominion Voting Systems’ lawsuit against Fox, in which the voting technology firm claimed that Fox perpetuated falsehoods about its voting machines in an effort to appease the network’s base of supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump. Fox settled the lawsuit for $787.5 million in April, avoiding a trial in which Lachlan and his father were expected to testify.In public remarks in the weeks following the settlement, Lachlan said that Fox had been acting as a news organization reporting on the newsworthy events of the day, and recommitted to Fox’s programming strategy.While Rupert Murdoch built his legacy pursuing the television, movie and newspaper businesses with equal abandon, Lachlan’s legacy is still taking shape. In calls with investors, he often becomes animated when speaking about Tubi, an ad-supported streaming service that the company acquired for $440 million in 2020, and which is now valued at $3 billion.Lachlan Murdoch's family lives in Sydney, Australia, and he travels to Los Angeles, where Fox is based and they also maintain a home.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles and Helen Coster in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Nick Zieminski)]"

The similarities are apparent enough that Rupert Murdoch barred his ex-wife Jerry Hall from giving story ideas to Succession writers in their divorce settlement.Logan Roy, played by Brian Cox, is widely thought to be a composite of Murdoch and another media baron, the deceased Sumner Redstone, whose real-life story is even more dramatic than any HBO show, as captured in the recent book Unscripted (on which a new TV series may soon be based). But it’s the laundry list of similarities between Murdoch and the Waystar Royco CEO that makes them the closest analogues—from their foreign origins and numerous health scares, speeches atop printer paper podiums, multiple marriages and divorces, and, of course, pitting their children against each other while encouraging them to compete to be anointed as successor.The rivalry between Roman and Kendall Roy bears a striking resemblance to Lachlan and James Murdoch. Here’s a look at the Fox News succession—and who came out on top.Lachlan and JamesAlthough it’s been clear for a while, now it’s official: Murdoch said on Thursday that he’s handing the reins to his 52-year-old son Lachlan, who will become the sole chair of News Corp. and continue as executive chair and CEO of Fox Corporation.Lachlan, his older sister Elisabeth, and younger brother James have long been contenders for the top job. But Lachlan has seemingly always been Rupert’s “number-one boy” and the preferred choice to succeed him, Vanity Fair reported in May. Murdoch has suggested as much:Story continues""Currently it is their consensus that Lachlan will take over,"" Murdoch said in a 1997 interview, as reported by The Guardian. ""He will be the first among equals, but they will all have to prove themselves.""At first glance, Lachlan draws obvious comparisons to Kendall. Both are eldest sons who have been groomed to take over the family business one day. But in terms of personality, Lachlan more closely resembles Roman, the snarky, impulsive younger brother portrayed by Kieran Culkin.In 2005, Lachlan had a dispute with then-boss of Fox News, Roger Ailes—the same Ailes who was later sued by Fox host Gretchen Carlson for sexual harassment, which the movie Bombshell (featuring Margot Robbie and Nicole Kidman) was based. Lachlan quit his role as deputy COO of News Corp. and moved to Australia. He returned to the states nearly 10 years later at his father’s behest, agreeing to be his heir.But during Lachlan’s decade overseas, his younger brother, the now 50-year-old James, became the heir apparent. James spent those years climbing through the ranks, ensuring the longevity and respect of his father’s media empire by making deals with the likes of Hulu and National Geographic Channel and promising that News Corp. would go carbon neutral. His father bringing Lachlan back was like a “big slap in the face” to the younger brother, a source told Vanity Fair.James resembles Kendall in that he was known as “the smart one” and has been baited by his father for the top job for decades. James has served in high-ranking roles in News Corp. and even did a stint in Hong Kong, reminiscent of Kendall’s time in Shanghai. Jeremy Strong, the actor who portrays Kendall, told The New Yorker that he used details about James to prepare for the role.Disney and DominionIn August 2017, Murdoch and Disney CEO Bob Iger discussed selling 21st Century Fox’s assets to Disney. Lachlan and James clashed over the deal—Lachlan felt that his father and brother were rushing to sell his future empire out from underneath him, while James thought it was a good business opportunity, according to Vanity Fair. Not to mention, James was in talks with Iger to take a high-level position at Disney post-acquisition, the outlet reported.The deal went through. Disney acquired the 21st Century Fox movie and television studios for more than $52 billion in March 2019. Lachlan was left to run what remained—Fox News and the remaining assets—and James took his money and left to start a media fund called Lupa Systems. (The word lupa is Italian for “she-wolf,” like the one that raised the founding brothers of Rome—Romulus and Remus—before Romulus murdered Remus, Vanity Fair noted.)Then Fox News got involved with Trump. In 2020, Murdoch’s right-wing news network became the town crier of theories that the presidential election was stolen, asserting that voting machines owned by Dominion Voting Systems switched Americans’ votes to Biden after they’d voted for Trump. In response, Dominion brought a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit in March 2021 against Fox News, claiming that Murdoch protected Fox’s ratings by allowing hosts and guests to perpetuate the conspiracy. Two years later, Fox agreed to pay Dominion a $787 million settlement, and Fox host Tucker Carlson was fired.Elisabeth and PrudenceThe Succession inspirations go beyond Lachlan and James. Elisabeth is comparable to Siobhan (better known as Shiv), the sharp and poised daughter who originally pursued a career outside of her father’s empire and could run the company just as well if only she weren’t a woman in an ultra-conservative, male-dominated industry. Meanwhile, Prudence Murdoch resembles Connor Roy as she is the only child from the patriarch’s first marriage and is often considered the forgotten sibling.Lachlan and James don’t talk anymore. James has distanced himself from Fox News for its climate denialism, white nationalism, and election conspiracies. And now that Lachlan holds the keys to the kingdom, James is biding his time to oust his brother with the help of their sisters, Elisabeth and Prudence, once their father is gone, sources told Vanity Fair.People close to the Murdochs weren’t sure what James would do with Fox if he managed to win it back, but they assumed that he’d completely overhaul the organization or sell it off to the highest bidder.“James sees destroying Fox News as his mission in life,” a senior Fox staffer told Vanity Fair.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

46,37fc181b-f10e-31af-b247-4aa2c14a1246,NWS,2023-09-23,UPDATE 1-Murdoch Family Trust: The real battle over succession has yet to begin,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-murdoch-family-trust-real-152122247.html,1695396082.0,STORY,"['FOXA', 'NWSA']","[(Adds detail about a growing rift between Lachlan and James Murdoch in paragraphs 5-9)By Helen Coster and Dawn ChmielewskiNEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - When Lachlan Murdoch, the eldest son of media titan Rupert Murdoch, was named the sole chairman of News Corp and Fox Corp on Thursday, the announcement put to rest immediate questions about who will run a sprawling media empire that includes some of the most powerful brands in the world.The executive transition, however, does not settle another potential power play that could occur upon Rupert Murdoch’s death, as framed by a document called the Murdoch Family Trust.The Reno, Nevada-based trust lays out a scenario through which a potential takeover could occur. It is the vehicle through which the elder Murdoch controls News Corp and Fox Corp, through a roughly 40% stake in voting shares of each company. Murdoch also holds a small amount of shares of the companies outside of the trust.Upon Rupert’s death, News Corp and Fox Corp voting shares will be transferred from Murdoch to his four oldest children – Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James – creating a scenario in which three of the children could out-vote a fourth, potentially setting up a battle over the future of the companies, even as Lachlan Murdoch runs Fox Corp and is the sole chair of News Corp.This tension would likely play out over the future of Fox News, one of the most polarizing properties in the Murdoch empire, and an influential force in U.S. politics, particularly among Republicans who prize Fox's conservative-leaning audience.While Lachlan Murdoch does not speak publicly about his political views, James Murdoch has been more forthright. In January 2020, he and his wife Kathryn took aim at both News Corp and Fox Corp for downplaying the impact of climate change, widely viewed as a contributing factor to the Australian bushfires, in a statement to The Daily Beast.In a July 31, 2020 letter tendering his resignation from News Corp’s board of directors, which was disclosed in a News Corp filing, James Murdoch said he was resigning ""due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.""Story continuesMultiple media outlets, including the New York Times, Vanity Fair and the Financial Times, have reported on tension between the brothers over the direction of Fox and other family-controlled media outlets.In a 2021 FT interview, James Murdoch appeared to slam the channel without naming Fox News in comments about the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol siege. “The sacking of the Capitol is proof positive that what we thought was dangerous is indeed very, very much so,” he said. “Those outlets that propagate lies to their audience have unleashed insidious and uncontrollable forces that will be with us for years.”The Murdoch Family Trust has eight votes: four of which are controlled by Murdoch, and the remaining four controlled by the four children from his first two marriages. Murdoch’s youngest daughters Chloe and Grace, from his third wife Wendi Deng, do not have voting rights in the trust.Upon succession, the four older children will equally inherit Murdoch’s voting shares in the trust, according to Alice Enders, head of research at Enders Analysis.In addition to shares in News Corp and Fox, the trust also includes the Cruden family farm near Melbourne and Murdoch’s art collection, according to a January 2023 Financial Times report.Fox and News Corp have a dual-share system, with non-voting Class A shares and voting Class B shares. The shares in Fox and News Corp owned by Murdoch’s children through the trust are a combination of both classes of shares.“It’s not like a real succession scenario right now, this minute,” said Enders. “It’s more in the future I’d say.” (Reporting by Helen Coster in New York and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Stephen Coates and Marguerita Choy)]"

QuoteAccording to the company, by establishing and expanding its key operational activities in locations closer to customers, it can address local and regional needs in a better way.Story continuesOver the past year, shares of Align Technology have surged 35% against the industry’s 1.1% fall.On the flip side, although Align Technology is gradually coming out of the impact of the two-and-a-half-year-long healthcare crisis, the ongoing industry-wide trend of staffing shortages and supply chain-related hazards is denting growth. Deteriorating international trade, with global inflationary pressure leading to a tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, and a rising interest rate have put the dental treatment space (which is highly-elective) in a tight spot.All these are creating significant pressure on the company’s operating profit. During the last-reported second quarter, Align Technology witnessed a 6.3% increase in SG&amp;A expenses and a 21.3% rise in R&amp;D expenses. The operating income in the quarter under review highlighted a decline of 8.6%.

The stock has declined 14.4% over the past four weeks. However, given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround.Guide to Identifying Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why ALGN Could Bounce Back Before LongThe heavy selling of ALGN shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 26.68. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering ALGN in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0.2% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, ALGN currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises.

49,39f2524b-6332-30fb-8909-6a435506b957,MRO,2023-09-23,Marathon Oil (MRO): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market Value,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-oil-mro-comprehensive-analysis-153347367.html,1695396827,STORY,['MRO'],"[Marathon Oil Corp (NYSE:MRO) recently experienced a daily gain of 1.93% and a 3-month gain of 18.08%. With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 3.17, the question arises: is the stock fairly valued? This article provides a thorough valuation analysis of Marathon Oil, offering insights into the company's financial health, growth prospects, and intrinsic value. We encourage you to read on for a comprehensive understanding of Marathon Oil's market value.Company IntroductionMRO 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MROMarathon Oil Corp (NYSE:MRO) is an independent exploration and production company with a primary focus on unconventional resources in the United States. As of the end of 2022, Marathon Oil reported net proved reserves of 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent and a net production average of 343 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. The company's production ratio is 70% oil and NGLs and 30% natural gas.With a current share price of $26.37, Marathon Oil has a market cap of $16 billion. This price is compared against the GF Value, an estimation of the stock's fair value. The GF Value is computed considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. This comparison forms the basis for a profound exploration of the company's value.Marathon Oil (MRO): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value represents the intrinsic value of a stock, derived from a proprietary method. This method takes into account historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) at which the stock has traded, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.Marathon Oil's GF Value suggests that the stock is fairly valued. This is based on three key factors: historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the stock's share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. Conversely, if the stock's share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have high future returns. Given Marathon Oil's current price of $26.37 per share and a market cap of $16 billion, the stock appears to be fairly valued.Story continuesAs Marathon Oil is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Marathon Oil (MRO): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueMarathon Oil's Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy shares. A good starting point is to look at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Marathon Oil has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.04, which ranks worse than 87.81% of 1034 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Marathon Oil's financial strength as 6 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Marathon Oil (MRO): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is less risky. A company with high profit margins is typically a safer investment than those with low profit margins. Marathon Oil has been profitable 6 times over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $6.70 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $3.17. Its operating margin is 36.6%, which ranks better than 79.98% of 984 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Overall, the profitability of Marathon Oil is ranked 6 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Marathon Oil is 20.6%, which ranks better than 72.13% of 861 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 30.3%, which ranks better than 67.59% of 830 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) and the weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. Ideally, the return on invested capital should be higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months, Marathon Oil's return on invested capital is 10.67, and its cost of capital is 11.87.Marathon Oil (MRO): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueConclusionOverall, Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) stock appears to be fairly valued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is fair. Its growth ranks better than 67.59% of 830 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.

MSI, Ubiquiti Inc. UI and Aviat Networks, Inc. AVNW.Industry: WirelessLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2153568/3-wireless-stocks-likely-to-excel-on-solid-sector-dynamicsThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is expected to capitalize on the healthy demand trends backed by an accelerated pace of 5G deployment and fiber network infrastructure upgrade. However, large-scale investments for seamless 5G transition, margin erosion due to price wars, higher customer inventory levels and inflated raw material costs amid a challenging macroeconomic environment and uncertain business conditions might erode profitability.Nevertheless, Motorola Solutions, Inc., Ubiquiti Inc. and Aviat Networks, Inc. are likely to profit from the strong industry dynamics driven by a vast proliferation of IoT, rapid fiber densification and a gradual shift to cloud services.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry primarily comprises companies providing various networking solutions, wireless telecom products and related services for wireless voice and data communications through scalable modular platforms. Their product portfolio encompasses integrated circuit devices (chips) and system software for wireless voice and data communications, analog and digital two-way radio, satellite telecommunications, wireless networking and signal processing, and end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions.The firms also provide a broad range of routing, switching and security products, video surveillance and machine-to-machine communication components that secure VPN appliances, enable intrusion detection and thwart data theft. Some firms even provide electronic warfare, avionics, robotics, advanced communications and maritime systems to the defense industry.What's Shaping the Future of the Wireless Equipment Industry?Focus on Demand-Driven Operations: With the exponential growth of mobile broadband traffic and home Internet solutions, demand for advanced networking architecture has increased manifold. This has forced service providers to spend more on routers and switches to upgrade their networks and support the surge in home data traffic.Story continuesMoreover, a faster pace of 5G deployment is expected to augment the telecommunications industry's scalability, security and universal mobility and propel the wide proliferation of IoT. Expansion of fiber optic networks by carriers to support their 4G LTE and 5G wireless standards, as well as wireline connections, are likely to act as tailwinds. The fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and the last mile local loop, which are required by wireless service providers for 5G deployment.Fiber networks are also essential for the growing deployment of small cells that bring the network closer to the user and supplement macro networks to provide extensive coverage. The industry participants are facilitating its customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations and seamlessly migrate to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation through steady infrastructure investments.Margin Woes Persist: Although higher infrastructure investments will eventually help minimize service delivery costs to support broadband competition and wireless densification, short-term profitability has largely been compromised. Margins are likely to be affected by the high cost of first-generation 5G products, profitability challenges in China, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and pricing pressure in early 5G deals.Uncertainty regarding chip shortage and supply-chain disruptions leading to a dearth of essential fiber materials, shipping delays and shortages of other raw materials are expected to affect the expansion and rollout of new broadband networks. Extended lead times for basic components are also likely to hurt the delivery schedule and escalate production costs.Further, the high technological obsolescence of most products has escalated operating costs with steady investments in R&amp;D. High customer inventory levels, owing to intense market volatility, pose another headwind for the companies.Cloud Networking Thrust: The majority of the industry participants offer mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software and services that enable its customers to run businesses with increased efficiency and safety for their mobile workforce. These systems drive demand for additional device sales, software upgrades, infrastructure overhaul and expansion, as well as additional services to maintain, monitor and manage these complex networks and solutions.The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks for constant critical communication operations. The wide proliferation of cloud networking solutions is further resulting in increased storage and computing on a virtual plane. As both consumers and enterprises use the network, there is tremendous demand for quality networking equipment.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish ProspectsThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #76, which places it in the top 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright prospects.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of industry trends reflecting the rise of social sciences, head straight to the 5 Highest Paying Social Sciences Jobs that are in Demand.At the heart of every corporation lies a deep understanding of human behavior, society, and culture. Social sciences essentially represent disciplines like sociology, psychology, anthropology, economics, and political science. These fields equip professionals with the skills to decode complex human interactions, anticipate societal trends, and devise strategies that resonate with vast consumer bases. In essence, social sciences provide the invaluable human element that complements the data-driven, technological aspects of modern businesses.Industry Trends Reflecting the Rise of Social SciencesIn recent years, a paradigm shift has occurred in the way large corporations operate and strategize. They are increasingly recognizing that a holistic understanding of consumers, employees, and the broader societal context is crucial for sustainable growth. Firstly, in the age of e-commerce and digital marketing, understanding consumer behavior is more critical than ever. Social scientists leverage their expertise to conduct consumer research, identify trends, and guide marketing strategies that resonate with specific target demographics.Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) exemplifies the use of human behavior analysis in the retail sector.

Moreover, Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD)’s personalized recommendation engines employ different data modalities like text, images, and click-stream data, to match customers with relevant product suggestions that align with their preferences and intent.Story continuesSecondly, many corporations are actively investing in diversity and inclusion programs as they recognize that a diverse workforce and inclusive environment are essential for innovation and competitiveness. Social sciences professionals play pivotal roles in developing and implementing these initiatives by ensuring that they are tailored to the unique needs of each organization.Speaking of diversity and inclusion, Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) stands out as the most diverse and inclusive company in the US, as recognized by DiversityInc's prestigious Top 50 Companies for Diversity list.

If you want to skip our indepth analysis of emerging trends in jobs, head straight to the 10 High Paying Jobs That Don’t Require Math.While the world was already at the crossroads of changing times, COVID-19 accelerated the pace with which the change was embraced. Not only did the world observe a transition of work settings in the form of remote work, but the values associated with conventional educational backgrounds like college degrees were also observed to reduce. Moreover, for a fair number of people who never imagined learning any skills online, e-learning became the only alternative, and hence, the new normal. It was indeed fascinating to observe how this also democratized access to technical roles, irrespective of one's traditional educational background or mathematical abilities. Before diving into the list of high-paying non-technical jobs, let’s explore the trends that have been facilitating individuals to transition into technical roles from nontech backgrounds.Growing Popularity of Low-Code/No-Code DevelopmentThe relationship between mathematical ability and coding ability has also been explored empirically and some research also establishes a connection between the two abilities. While not a 100% conclusive, the explored connection, if true, suggests that individuals who don't go along well with math, might also not enjoy coding or excel at it. However, distaste for certain fields of study should not be a hinderance in one's career in Software. This is where low-code/no-code platforms come in.These platforms provide visual interfaces and prebuilt components that simplify the coding process and allow individuals with little to no coding experience to create applications quickly. The allure of low-code/no-code platforms lies in their ability to democratize application development for what are often referred to as ""citizen developers.""Story continuesMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Power BI is a popular business analytics tool that simplifies data analysis and visualization with its user-friendly, no-code interface. Users can generate interactive reports and dashboards without extensive coding expertise and thus, business professionals can extract insights from data efficiently. Similarly, Excel, a widely used spreadsheet application, incorporates low-code functionalities through features like Power Query and Power Pivot that allow users to manipulate data and perform complex calculations with ease.There is no denying that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is among the top players in technological advancements especially in the field of technology as it is also one of the top AI companies in America. In fact, it has also been called the leader in generative AI. Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Most notably, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was able to gain an immediate leadership position in generative Al by making a US$10 billion investment in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, earlier this year. Microsoft’s Bing search engine has since introduced ChatGPT into its web index data-a collection so large that it is rivaled by the dataset of only one other business in the world, Alphabet’s Google. Data are the feedstock of Al models, and an Al-enhanced search engine trained on so much data may attract more users to Bing, allowing Microsoft to sell more ads on the service. Microsoft is also adding generative Al to other products, including the Azure cloud service, enabling business customers who use Azure to easily integrate OpenAl models to glean more insights from their data and automate functions such as certain IT tasks. These added capabilities should motivate more businesses to migrate their data to the cloud and make Azure more competitive with Amazon.com’s AWS and Google Cloud.”Teachable Machine by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) represents another facet of the low-code/no-code development. This platform utilizes machine learning to make creating custom models accessible to a broader audience. Users can train machine learning models without coding. Teachable Machine enables individuals to interact with AI and machine learning and reduce the technical barriers that once limited their participation in this field. Chatbots and AI Conversation ToolsChatbots have also facilitated coding for non-coders as generative Ai tools like chatGPT or Bard AI can write any code if provided with the correct prompt and instructions. According to market analysis by Technavio, the global live chat software market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.91% between 2022 and 2027, driven by the increasing customer expectations for real-time support and personalized interactions. This trend reflects the evolving nature of online customer engagement. As today's consumers demand immediate support and personalized experiences when interacting with online businesses, Chatbots and AI-powered conversation tools have stepped in to meet these expectations.How the Rise of E-Learning is Recreating Interest in Dry SubjectsThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reported that in the fall of 2020, 75% of all postsecondary students in the US — over 14 million learners — enrolled in online classes as the pandemic restricted in-person learning. This marked a substantial increase from the 36% enrolled in distance education in the preceding year.These statistics are not just numbers, they represent a fundamental shift in how education is delivered. E-learning has become the new normal and its advantage lies in the visual aspect integral to it. Math is an incredibly dry subject, but various of its branches like geometry and topology can be made remarkably intuitive using interactive visuals. This is where E-learning has an advantage for subjects like Math over traditional learning.One of the biggest platforms of e-learning has been Udemy Inc (NASDAQ:UDMY), with 64 million students and 75,000 instructors that offer over 210,000 courses. Moreover, 50% of Fortune 100 companies are Udemy Inc (NASDAQ:UDMY) Business clients who access a repository of 24,000 courses. Udemy Inc (NASDAQ:UDMY) is primarily famous for providing an opportunity to upskill and offers certain courses that can even lead to technical certifications. 25 High Paying Jobs That Don't Require MathImageFlow/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo list the high-paying jobs that don’t require math, we targeted jobs with little to no math, no steep learning curve and technical expertise.

But most are in the early stages of figuring out where they can make money. GE Health Care is looking at consumer medical devices while some of the big box retailers like Walmart and even Best Buy are looking for ways to get a piece of the $4 trillion health care pie. Yahoo finance's Anjalee Khemlani has more on this story for us, Anj.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right, Seana. You, of course, know the players that are in the retail health care space thinking of CVS, Walmart, and Walgreens who have been increasingly providing provider services or checkups. But now, we're starting to see, really, a growth in demand for things like medical devices especially as more care gets put in the home. And that's where companies like Best Buy and GE are starting to take a look at where they can play.Best Buy, for example, in a recent interview told me that they are looking at bringing some of those medical devices into the stores, taking advantage of their big footprint as well as Geek Squad as support for these individuals, especially catering to seniors and the like. So they're talking about you know putting, for example, scooters in the stores, and hearing aids as well, especially as they're starting to roll out what they're calling Experience Stores, so where you get to try the product. That's something that's really been a focus for them.They've already been building out their health department which is something that has been sort of quietly working on deals since about 2017. $1.2 billion already invested in some of these deals for tech platforms or at-home device companies, Geek Squad, like I mentioned, to help the seniors, and those Experience Stores.Story continuesAnd I thought it was quite interesting. And so I asked, well, what else could we expect? What kinds of products do we anticipate rolling out, things that could be used by the elderly.And I got that part from the president of Best Buy Health saying, quote, ""You would indeed see new categories like electric scooters, next to traditional tech customers love to see from Best Buy like TVs."" But in addition to that, they have the interactive over-the-counter hearing aids which we know is a recent progress from Medicare. So all of these things coming together.Meanwhile, GE, you think about them as just a retail product maker for a long time, right, and appliances? But they're also pretty big in the medical device space. And they, too, are starting to see this trend develop.And looking at where they get to play a role, so they've been doing stuff like creating handheld at-home devices. They recently acquired a company called Caption Health which helps with AI guiding for those, say, like an ultrasound machine, a portable ultrasound machine. And that could really put these products in consumers' hands.And they're looking at partnerships with some of these retailers. One of the things that I was told was, you know, think about maybe getting a mammogram while you're at Walmart or CVS? You know, why not? So there's certainly opportunity. And you're starting to see the segment really take off now.BRAD SMITH: All right. Anjalee, thank you so much for tracking all of that, continuing to keep it on our radars as well. Yahoo Finance's own Anjalee Khemlani, appreciate it.]"

XEL received approval from Minnesota officials for the expansion of a solar energy project under construction. The State Public Utilities Commission approved adding a 250-megawatt (MW) array to a 460-MW array, which is a part of the Sherco solar project. According to the company, the project will be completed by 2025.Details of the ProjectThe new additions will require a fresh investment of $406 million, taking Xcel Energy’s total investment to over $1 billion. More than 150,000 houses will have access to the 710-MW project's yearly energy supply.Once completed, the new power will replace the electricity produced by a coal-fired facility, which will be shut down later this year. By 2030, three coal-fired power units will be shut down by the company.A proposal for Xcel Energy to purchase power from a projected 100-MW solar plant in northwest Wisconsin was also approved by the commission.Focus on Emission ReductionXcel Energy aims to benefit from its investment to strengthen infrastructure and clean power generation. It is undertaking initiatives to produce and deliver clean energy to customers. In 2022, XEL received approval for both Minnesota and Colorado resource plans that will add nearly 10,000 MW of utility-scale renewables to the system and is expected to reduce carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2030. The addition of new clean energy projects will assist the company in achieving the net-zero emission target for 2050.Xcel Energy aims to spend $29.5 billion during the 2023-2027 period. These investments are aimed to strengthen and expand the company’s transmission, distribution, electric generation and renewable projects.Utilities Focus on RenewablesUtilities in the United States are gradually gaining strength from renewable sources of energy, with an increased focus on solar projects. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), sun and wind have been a dominant source of U.S. electricity generation in recent years. EIA expects an increase in utility-scale solar capacity of 26 gigawatt (GW) and 33 GW in 2023 and 2024, respectively. These would be the highest solar installations for any year on record.According to Solar Energy Industries Association, the U.S. solar industry installed 5.6 GW-direct current of capacity in the second quarter of 2023, indicating a 20% increase from the year-ago quarter’s level.Apart from Xcel Energy, other electric power utility companies like Dominion Energy Inc. D, Ameren Corp. AEE and Duke Energy Corp. DUK are also focused on enhancing their footprint in the U.S. solar market.In August 2023, Dominion Energy unveiled a solar and energy storage project at the Dulles International Airport near Washington, DC, marking the largest renewable energy project ever developed at a U.S. airport. In partnership with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (“MWAA”), D plans an 835-acre, 100-MW capacity solar energy on the southwestern edge of the airport, along with a 50-MW energy storage facility. The project will generate enough to power more than 37,000 Virginia households at its peak output.D’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 4%. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 4.3% in the last four quarters.In June 2023, Ameren announced that its arm, Ameren Missouri, has planned to increase its renewable energy generation capability with 550 MW of solar projects. AEE aims to either acquire or construct four solar projects, which will be enough to power more than 95,000 average-sized residential homes.AEE’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.43%. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 8.9% in the last four quarters.In March 2023, Duke Energy’s non-regulated commercial brand, Duke Energy Sustainable Solutions, announced that its 250-MW Pisgah Ridge Solar project in Texas attained commercial operations. This provided a boost to its Texas solar portfolio as it progresses toward its zero-carbon emission goal.DUK’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.09%.

The award will partially fund two long duration energy storage systems in Minnesota and Colorado.Each demonstration-scale system will be a 10 megawatt/1,000 megawatt-hour iron-air battery developed by Massachusetts-based Form Energy. The batteries will be located at the sites of two retiring Xcel Energy coal plants: the Sherburne County Generating Station in Becker, Minnesota, and the Comanche Generating Station in Pueblo, Colorado. Once operational, the systems will allow Xcel Energy to store renewable energy such as solar and wind when it is being produced and then later distribute the energy during periods of lower renewable production.""As we explore cutting-edge technologies to accelerate our journey toward 100% carbon-free electricity, we are committed to also keep our services affordable for our customers,"" said Bob Frenzel, chairman, president and CEO of Xcel Energy. ""The Department of Energy grant provides crucial financial support for projects that will provide reliable, low-cost renewable energy to the communities we serve.""While most existing battery technologies serve fewer than eight hours of energy storage, Form Energy’s iron-air batteries deliver electricity for up to 100 hours. The long duration energy storage systems will strengthen the grid against day-to-day and week-to-week variability of renewable energy.""As we build our clean energy future, reliable energy storage systems will play a key role in protecting communities by providing dependable sources of electricity when and where it’s needed most, particularly in the aftermath of extreme weather events or natural disasters,"" said U.S Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. ""Thanks to President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, DOE is supporting game-changing energy storage projects across the nation—laying the foundation for the innovative solutions we need to ensure stronger, more resilient communities.""Story continuesSeparate from the Department of Energy funding, Xcel Energy received a $20 million grant commitment in April from the Breakthrough Energy Catalyst fund for emerging climate technologies that reduce emissions and accelerate the clean energy transition. The Breakthrough grant provides $10 million each for the Minnesota and Colorado battery systems, subject to the satisfaction of certain funding conditions. In addition to the grants, Xcel Energy plans to use provisions in the federal Inflation Reduction Act, such as standalone storage tax credits, to further lower the cost of the iron-air batteries.The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission previously approved the project with the support of the Minnesota Department of Commerce. Construction of the battery system in Minnesota — to be located near one of the largest solar developments in the U.S., the upcoming 710 megawatt Sherco Solar installation — will start in the second quarter of 2024.Pending approval from the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, work on the Colorado battery system could begin in late 2024. The projects are expected to support 15 to 20 construction jobs in each state.The Department of Energy grant is contingent on negotiation and project logistics.Learn more about Xcel Energy’s clean energy plans.About Xcel EnergyXcel Energy (NASDAQ: XEL) provides the energy that powers millions of homes and businesses across eight Western and Midwestern states.

In the first half of fiscal 2024, the company generated operating and free cash flows of $858 million and 842 million, respectively.Raised Fiscal 2024 GuidanceBuoyed by the stronger-than-expected second-quarter performance, Autodesk raised its guidance for fiscal 2024. The company now projects fiscal 2024 revenues between $5,405 million and $5,455 million, up from the previous guidance range of $5,355-5,455 million, indicating 8-9% growth.

71,9159642d-2106-3d81-b1eb-1725d7403a5d,MNST,2023-09-23,Coca-Cola’s Lower Valuation May Yield Higher Returns Despite Monster Beverage’s Robust Growth,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-lower-valuation-may-162041959.html,1695399641,STORY,"['MNST', 'KO']","[In recent years, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:MNST), two industry leaders in the beverage sector, have been on divergent paths. Despite Coca-Cola's stock trading at a lower valuation of 5.7 times revenue compared to Monster's 8.7 times, and Monster demonstrating superior revenue growth and a stronger financial position, an analysis of various factors suggests that Coca-Cola may offer higher returns over the next three years.Monster Beverage has seen impressive revenue growth with an average annual rate of 14.6% over the past three years, outpacing Coca-Cola's 5.6%. This growth is attributed to strong demand for its energy drinks, new product launches, and international expansion. On the other hand, Coca-Cola's revenue growth has been supported by both at-home and away-from-home channels due to robust pricing trends. In addition, its North America and Latin America segments registered a notable 19% year-over-year sales growth in 2022.Monster Beverage also outperformed Coca-Cola in terms of returns over the past few years, posting a remarkable 120% return compared to Coca-Cola's 8% decline and the S&amp;P 500 index's 15% increase.Despite slower sales growth, however, Coca-Cola remains more profitable. Its operating margin slipped from 29.9% in 2019 to 28.8% in 2022, while Monster Beverage's fell from 33.4% to 25.1%, largely due to rising costs.In terms of financial risk, Monster Beverage has an advantage with cash making up 35% of its assets compared to Coca-Cola's 14%. Furthermore, Coca-Cola’s debt-to-equity ratio sits around 16%, whereas Monster Beverage operates debt-free.When it comes to valuation multiples, Coca-Cola appears more attractive. It's expected to see its price-to-sales (P/S) multiple expand, potentially leading to better returns over the next three years. Currently, Coca-Cola's stock trades at 5.7 times sales compared to its five-year average of 6.8 times, whereas Monster Beverage's stock trades at 8.7 times revenues versus its five-year average of 4.9 times.Story continuesMonster Beverage's higher P/S multiple is somewhat justified by its strong revenue growth, but the current figure of 9 times sales seems stretched, particularly given its operating margins are lower than the 33% level seen in 2019, before the pandemic hit.In conclusion, while Monster Beverage has shown superior revenue growth and a stronger financial position, Coca-Cola's profitability and lower valuation multiple indicate it might offer better returns over the next three years. Machine learning analysis predicts an expected return of 8% for Coca-Cola and a -1% return for Monster Beverage over this period.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

74,c02da2b5-ddb5-3704-82f9-7afab859a089,LUV,2023-09-23,"Escalating scandal grips airlines including American and Southwest, wreaking havoc on flight delays and cancellations as nearly 100 planes find fake parts from company with fake employees that vanished overnight",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/escalating-scandal-grips-airlines-including-190553757.html,1695409553,STORY,"['LUV', 'AAL']","[About 100 planes around the world have been caught up in a scandal that would be cartoonish if it weren’t so terrifying. It saw a dubious company, with fake employees and an address that was a glorified PO box, sell and distribute fake airplane parts that ended up in planes belonging to some of the world’s biggest airlines. On Thursday night, American Airlines became the fourth, and so far final, airline to have found parts from AOG Technics in its aircraft. Southwest kicked off the disclosures from various airlines around the world in early September, when it became the first to announce it had located an unregistered part from AOG Technics.American Airlines “identified the uncertified components on a small number of aircraft,” according to an emailed statement to Fortune, while Southwest told Fortune it had identified one engine that contained two parts from AOG Technics.The parts scandal comes as the latest development in a series of difficulties that have embroiled the airline industry. It has had two consecutive summers plagued with seemingly constant flight delays and cancellations as “revenge travel” grips a worldwide public eager to get out after a pandemic-era hibernation. American Airlines and United both had to navigate the high-wire act of negotiating new pilots union contracts—and both did so successfully. But the prospect of faulty parts, albeit affecting a small fraction of the world’s fleet of roughly 25,500 commercial aircraft, is swiftly piling up delays. Regulators, airlines, and parts suppliers around the world are scrambling to track down possible bogus parts as the AOG Technics scandal spreads from the U.S. all the way to Australia.The mysterious London-based firm stands accused of falsifying certain documents and shipping the suspect parts to airline repair shops around the world. Companies like AOG Technics are middlemen that supply parts to independent firms that airlines contract to do repairs on their planes. The parts in question were used to repair jet engines made by CFM International, a joint venture between GE and the French firm Safran, used in older models of Airbus and Boeing engines. CFM is now suing AOG Technics in London’s High Court to get access to documents that would illustrate the extent of its fraud, so that all the bogus parts can be tracked down. So far, CFM believes AOG Technics may have sold thousands of parts with fraudulent documentation.Story continues“Parts are accompanied by a lifetime of paperwork,” said Robert Mann, president of the airline industry consulting firm R.W. Mann and Company. In the aviation industry, every part of a plane is carefully tracked to ensure its provenance and quality are accounted for. A single faulty part could have catastrophic safety consequences.CFM, the engine manufacturer, became aware of the issues in June when a Portuguese repair shop alerted it to the existence of allegedly forged documents bearing its name, according to Reuters. By August, the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (the country’s equivalent of the Federal Aviation Administration) had released a safety notice announcing it was “investigating the supply of a large number of Suspect Unapproved Parts” originating from AOG Technics. Airlines and maintenance shops that had purchased any parts from AOG Technics were encouraged to verify whether they had actually come from where the distributor claimed they did.Europe’s aviation regulator, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), released a notice around the same time confirming that certain documents had been forged to make it appear as if AOG Technics’ parts had come from legitimate manufacturers. “In each confirmed example, the approved organization, identified on the [Authorized Release Certificate], has attested that the form did not originate from within their organization, and the certificate has been falsified,” the EASA’s statement read. On Thursday the FAA became the latest regulator to issue a notice about AOG Technics’ bogus parts scheme.A “deep fake” company in the gray market of airplane parts“While there have always been gray and black markets in aircraft parts, mostly purchased by questionable customers, this is a case of a “deep fake” company masquerading as a legitimate supplier that deceived many legitimate buyers,” Mann said.He told Fortune that gray market products are often component’s that are either certified or deemed repairable but don’t meet some other requirement and should therefore be scrapped. Instead these parts “get sold cheaply to customers who need inexpensive replacements.” Black market dealings can be slightly more nefarious in nature, often entailing sale of military technology to countries that are under international sanctions, such as selling spare F-14 fighter jets to Iran.Mann also laid some portion of the blame at the buyers’ feet. “It is also disturbing that sophisticated customers who should have been able to properly vet the supplier were nonetheless duped, potentially placing safety of customers, employees, and aircraft at risk,” he said.As of last week the EASA said “to date there have been no reports of problems resulting from the suspect unapproved parts.”What do we know about AOG Technics and its founder?AOG Technics was founded by Jose Alejandro Zamora Yrala in 2015, according to public filings in the UK. In addition to allegedly forging documents for airplane parts it appears that AOG Technics created several fake LinkedIn profiles claiming to be company executives, according to Bloomberg. The profiles listed for its chief commercial officer Ray Kwong and an executive sales representative Johnny Rico featured stock photos and employment histories that couldn’t be verified by any of their purported former employers.A further look into other filings under Yrala’s name show he founded two other companies in the UK: real estate company Kensho Group LTD and ecom vendor Sunwave Solutions. Yrala’s business partner at Sunwave Ricardo Maquilon Chedrauy told Bloomberg the company sold kitchen appliances “on Amazon to kill time during the pandemic.” Kensho folded in January 2023 and Sunwave appears to still be operational—or at least hasn’t filed for dissolution.Yrala’s filings offer some insight into businesses that were run in an unusual fashion. Several of the filings are riddled with typos, including misspelled executive titles and oddly capitalized words that appear to have happened when someone hit caps lock instead of the “A” key.  Other documents show a series of shifting corporate addresses, some of which end up back at either a coworking space in London and the offices of a now-retired accountant in a sleepy West Sussex town.A Certificate of Incorporation filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales in January 2021 listed Kensho’s headquarters at the same London address of AOG Technics—the North Nova building just a few blocks from Buckingham Palace. Within the upscale, gleaming office tower AOG Technics rented a “virtual” address from coworking space The Argyll Club for $100 a month, according to Bloomberg. In April 2021, Kensho requested an address change to a residence in Haywards Heath, West Sussex that is the same address of Brian Cook Associates, a private accounting practice listed as an agent in the original certificate of incorporation. That same West Sussex address was used to incorporate Yrala’s ecom company Sunwave Solutions. (Brian Cook did not respond to a request for comment.)AOG Technics’ website and LinkedIn profile are no longer active and a Google search for the company lists it as “permanently closed.” The company did not respond to a request for comment. Lawyers for Yrala and AOG told Reuters they are cooperating fully with an investigation opened by the CAA.What airlines have found fake parts? Southwest Airlines was the first major airline to disclose that it had found uncertified parts that originated from AOG Technics in its aircraft. It first became aware of the problem in August “and took necessary steps to ensure we do not have any parts in our fleet from AOG,” the company said. After Southwest’s suppliers conducted a review of its parts the company removed two low pressure turbine blades from one of its jets.A few days later, Virgin Australia also found a turbine blade with forged documents had been used in its planes. The fact parts from a European supplier were found in airlines in Oceania and North America illustrated just how global an issue the industry was facing and how difficult it would be to track down every individual part that may have been allegedly sold under false pretenses. A week later Virgin Australia discovered another, different part, this time a turbine nozzle, had been used in a second jet. Both planes were grounded until replacements could be installed. A spokesperson for Virgin Australia said safety is the company's ""highest priority"" and it applies a ""highly stringent approach to maintenance"" to ensure it is upheld.Earlier this week, United became the third airline to disclose it had identified AOG Technics’ bogus parts in its airplanes. Two United jets were found to have had unregistered parts in their engines, the company said. Both planes are undergoing the requisite maintenance to replace the part before being used again. United will “continue to investigate as new information becomes available from our suppliers,” the company said. American Airlines said it would “continue working” with suppliers and the FAA “to ensure these parts are no longer in our supply or otherwise in use on our aircraft.”Update 22, Sept. 2023: This article has been updated to include a statement from Virgin Australia.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 5 Stocks.In the ever-fluctuating landscape of global financial markets, recent developments have brought both optimism and uncertainty to investors worldwide. While Asian markets generally witnessed a trend of declines, an intriguing and notable exception emerged in the form of a robust rally in Chinese stocks. This unexpected surge in Chinese equities ran counter to the prevailing regional sentiment, with stock markets in Japan, Australia, and South Korea experiencing declines. Meanwhile, in the realm of global bond markets, the 10-year Treasury yield, a key indicator closely monitored by financial analysts, touched a significant milestone by reaching 4.5%, a level not seen since 2007. This milestone reflects the evolving dynamics of global interest rates. Furthermore, amidst these market movements, the Japanese Yen faced a weakening trend after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained its rates and guidance unchanged. Notably, the buoyancy in Chinese stocks was underscored by a particular focus on the technology sector, with the Hang Seng Tech index surging by as much as 2.6%. This intriguing blend of market dynamics paints a vivid picture of the ongoing intricacies within the financial world, where regional disparities, global bond market shifts, and central bank decisions all play pivotal roles in shaping investment landscapes. The recent turbulence in financial markets has left traders grappling with a rapidly unfolding reality. This week, major exchange-traded funds (ETFs) monitoring stocks, bonds, and commodities have all witnessed a significant sell-off, marking their first simultaneous week of losses in a month. Over four trading sessions, each of these ETFs has recorded at least 0.8% declines. This synchronized downturn is currently tracking as the third most substantial weekly loss since October, underscoring the challenging terrain investors are navigating as they adjust to the Federal Reserve's outlook, which anticipates elevated borrowing costs persisting for an extended period.Story continuesOil prices rebounded, mitigating a weekly loss primarily triggered by the Federal Reserve's announcement of a potential increase in US interest rates this year. This Fed update has subdued enthusiasm for risk assets and somewhat overshadowed the tangible supply constraints within the crude oil market. On September 22, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil surpassed the $90 per barrel mark, helping to narrow the weekly decline to less than 1%. The Fed's indication that borrowing costs are likely to remain elevated for an extended period has provided support for the US dollar, which, in turn, has diminished the appeal of commodities, including crude oil. Additionally, technical factors suggested that oil's recent price increases might have been excessive, contributing to the retracement in prices. The oil market remains a dynamic arena, where the interplay of market fundamentals, central bank policies, and technical analysis shapes price movements.On the Asian side, Singapore has overtaken Hong Kong as the world's freest economy, as reported by the Canadian think tank Fraser Institute. This marks a historic shift, as Hong Kong, which had held the top spot since the inception of the Economic Freedom of the World Index in 1970, has now fallen to second place, and its score is expected to decline further. The index evaluates economic freedom based on factors such as ease of international trade, market competition, and business regulations. The 2023 report is based on 2021 data, measuring individuals' economic freedom, or their ability to make independent economic decisions. According to Fraser Institute's senior fellow, Matthew Mitchell, this shift in Hong Kong's ranking reflects the close link between economic freedom and civil and political freedom. Hong Kong's decline is attributed to new regulatory barriers, rising business costs, and restrictions on foreign labor, which have curtailed economic freedom and could impact its prosperity. In contrast, Singapore climbed to the top spot from second place in the previous year, driven by improvements in its government size and regulation components. Switzerland, New Zealand, and the United States occupy the third, fourth, and fifth positions, respectively. The United Kingdom ranks ninth, with Japan and Germany in the 20th and 23rd positions, respectively. These findings shed light on the evolving landscape of economic freedom globally and its potential consequences for economic prosperity and civil liberties.On the stock market front, analysts are bearish on several stocks by trimming their price targets.

76,bb33dcfe-e206-3808-a1d0-de86eccb7157,PPG,2023-09-23,PPG Industries (PPG) Upgraded to Buy: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppg-industries-ppg-upgraded-buy-160006963.html,1695398406,STORY,['PPG'],"[PPG Industries (PPG) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for PPG Industries is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for PPG Industries imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for PPG IndustriesFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this paint and coatings maker is expected to earn $7.51 per share, which is a change of 24.1% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for PPG Industries. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 3.6%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating.

77,a99bb971-2f53-38ec-a02a-bb8cd56bad1c,PPG,2023-09-23,PPG Industries (PPG) Could Be a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppg-industries-ppg-could-great-154503810.html,1695397503,STORY,['PPG'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.PPG Industries in FocusPPG Industries (PPG) is headquartered in Pittsburgh, and is in the Basic Materials sector. The stock has seen a price change of 2.03% since the start of the year. The paint and coatings maker is paying out a dividend of $0.65 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.03% compared to the Chemical - Specialty industry's yield of 0.85% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.71%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.60 is up 7.4% from last year. PPG Industries has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.53%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, PPG Industries's payout ratio is 36%, which means it paid out 36% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, PPG expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.51 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 24.13%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that PPG is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.PPG Industries has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Novozymes A/S has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that PPG has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.PPG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.09, while NVZMY has a forward P/E of 23.83. We also note that PPG has a PEG ratio of 1.03. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. NVZMY currently has a PEG ratio of 13.54.Another notable valuation metric for PPG is its P/B ratio of 3.88. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NVZMY has a P/B of 4.63.These metrics, and several others, help PPG earn a Value grade of B, while NVZMY has been given a Value grade of D.Story continuesPPG is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that PPG is likely the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The transaction, which is expected to be worth approximately $500 million, would allow these firms to acquire a loan-origination business at a beneficial price. However, the final terms of the deal are yet to be confirmed.This move comes after Goldman Sachs acknowledged that its acquisition of GreenSky in 2021, valued at around $1.7 billion in stock, was overpriced. The financial services giant had written down $504 million of goodwill from its consumer division in July this year, reflecting this overvaluation.The decision to sell GreenSky is part of Goldman Sachs' strategic plan to divest from non-core businesses. This strategy has been implemented particularly as the firm's traditional mainstay - capital markets activity - has seen a surge in recent weeks. Goldman Sachs has notably served as the lead underwriter for the initial public offerings of Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), Instacart (CART), and Klaviyo (KVYO), marking some of the most significant market debuts this year.For the buyer consortium led by Sixth Street, acquiring GreenSky offers an opportunity to expand into lending segments that many banks have been reluctant to explore. This strategic move comes during a period when rising interest rates have posed balance-sheet challenges for banks due to depreciating bondholding values.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The bank, based in New York, has struggled to put the scandal to rest even three years after agreeing to pay over $5 billion for its role in the misappropriation of Malaysia's 1MDB investment fund.Behind the scenes, Goldman Sachs executives have been making fresh overtures to resolve one of the most embarrassing episodes in the bank's history. This comes after Anwar recently stated that he might consider taking Goldman Sachs to court due to disagreements related to the deal sealed by the previous government.In a conversation with Bloomberg News during his visit to New York for the United Nations General Assembly, Anwar struck a more conciliatory tone. He suggested that a settlement was possible as they were not unreasonable and wanted what was fair. He also stated that while it would not be fair to reassess the entire deal, there were specific areas where flaws existed that needed attention.The 1MDB fund became the center of a multi-billion dollar scandal that led to investigations across continents. After striking an initial agreement in 2020, Goldman admitted its role in the biggest foreign bribery case in U.S. enforcement history. The bank reached multiple international settlements exceeding $5 billion for its part in raising funds for 1MDB.As part of the 2020 settlement, Goldman Sachs made an initial payment of $2.5 billion and guaranteed the return of $1.4 billion of 1MDB assets seized by authorities worldwide in exchange for Malaysia dropping charges against the bank. According to Goldman Sachs, an interim payment of $250 million was required if Malaysia did not receive at least $500 million in assets and proceeds by August 2022. This has led to a dispute between the two parties, which Goldman Sachs has made public in its filings.The latest discussions only concern the asset-valuation dispute, according to a Goldman Sachs spokesperson. Despite the ongoing negotiations, Anwar warned Goldman Sachs against assuming that the threat of a lawsuit was a bluff. He stated that while the legal fees were manageable for the government, the integrity of Goldman Sachs was in question.Story continuesAnwar also mentioned that Malaysia is making efforts to repatriate former Goldman banker Roger Ng, who was sentenced in the U.S. to 10 years in prison over his role in the scandal. He believes that Ng could provide significant assistance in their investigations.The Malaysian government has expressed dissatisfaction with the existing deal and Goldman's approach to it. Anwar highlighted two main issues: the quantum and interpretation of some clauses. He suggested that he could get personally involved if needed, but doesn't see the need for it at this stage, expressing confidence in his competent team.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The settlement is the latest in a series of penalties imposed on the Wall Street giant this year.The SEC found flaws in 22,000 data files, known as blue sheets, which contained at least 163 million transactions over a decade. Goldman's submissions had 43 different types of errors, including misreporting trades in US Central Time instead of the required Eastern Time. Blue sheets are routinely sent to regulators to probe suspect trading.""We are pleased to have resolved this matter,"" Goldman said in a statement, adding that they self-reported many of the errors and are in the process of submitting corrected blue sheets to the SEC. The bank also reached a related settlement with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), according to the SEC.Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs faced multiple fines from various regulatory bodies. In August, it paid $5.5 million to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over claims that it failed to retain thousands of phone calls. In April, it paid another $15 million to the CFTC for failing to disclose pricing data on some swaps transactions. Additionally, it paid $3 million to FINRA for mistakenly marking tens of millions of stock orders as long instead of short.As part of its efforts to address concerns from authorities including the Federal Reserve, Goldman Sachs is reportedly enlisting several hundred new staff members.Meanwhile, Mathew McDermott, Goldman's global head of digital assets, acknowledged in a CNBC interview in February that the firm maintains a crypto trading desk and envisions a greater role for cryptocurrency in financial markets.

A growing number of reputable scientific studies support the effectiveness of CEM as a mammography supplement. It can be carried out as part of routine clinical practice and employed in various therapeutic contexts, such as preoperative assessment of the severity of the disease or inconclusive results from earlier imaging techniques.Strategic ImplicationsThe collaboration combines the industry-leading technology of the two firms (Hologic mammography gantries and Bayer CEM-approved injection systems) to make it possible to administer contrast material during a mammogram. With the new partnership, Hologic and Bayer expect to provide radiologists and their teams with the best possible assistance by offering a complete product package and the practical training required to integrate CEM into their facility's workflow.Per Hologic management, contrast-enhanced mammography has drawn more attention in the past few years as a potential supplementary diagnostic tool.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the streaming industry and recent trends shaping the streaming market, go directly to 5 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy Now. Streaming has become an integral part of our daily lives, from watching movies and TV shows to listening to music and playing games. The rise of streaming services has been incredible, and there are no signs of slowing down. The streaming market size is projected to grow to $1.9 trillion by 2028, as noted by Fortune Business Insights. This remarkable growth is a testament to the profound impact streaming has had on our entertainment habits. In fact, if anything, the pace of change in streaming is only going to quicken, and the future is going to be even more exciting, going by some of the emerging trends and technologies on the horizon.Exponential advances in technology have changed entire industries, especially over the past 10 to 15 years. For example, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Prime Video, Hulu, and other digital channels or streaming services have acted as massive disruptive forces within the media and television industries. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) maintains a strong competitive edge compared to legacy media giants, as switching to streaming services for entertainment becomes more dominant. Netflix has demonstrated outstanding financial performance, with a return of 31.00% year-to-date (YTD) and 63.09% in the last 12 months. Over the past 10 years, the company had an annualized return of 24.58%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 benchmark, which had an annualized return of 9.99% during the same period.On the other hand, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has faced challenges in its financial performance, with a return of -4.97% year-to-date (YTD) and -20.99% in the last 12 months. Over the past 10 years, The Walt Disney Company had an annualized return of 3.45%, underperforming the S&amp;P500 index.Story continuesIn July 2023, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s CEO Bob Iger extended his contract through 2026, acknowledging the challenges ahead. Iger's concern about Disney's TV networks, which he suggested may not be central to Disney's core, highlights the industry's shifting priorities. The battle for supremacy in streaming and content distribution will undoubtedly persist, with Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) at the forefront of innovation and adaptation.Ensemble Capital Management shared a noteworthy observation about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in their Q2, 2023 investor letter: “Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) (+27.5%): Netflix posted a great quarter supported by a positive response to its password sharing crackdown and advertising-supported service rollout. In addition, some of its major competitors have been struggling, including Disney+ which lost subscribers in the first quarter for the first time in its history.”In the second quarter of 2023, Polen Focus Growth Strategy also turned its attention to stocks like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), further emphasizing the streaming giant's prominence in the investment landscape. In their Q2, 2023 investor letter, Polen Focus Growth Strategy provided the following insight regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX): ""The top absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance in the second quarter were Amazon, Netflix, and Microsoft. As mentioned, Amazon and Netflix are seeing their revenue growth accelerate after a difficult 2022 while keeping expense growth in check. We expect robust earnings growth for both companies in 2023 and growth rates in the mid-teens or higher well into the future.”The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s CEO Bob Iger has also been actively discussing his strategy to bring Disney+ to profitability in recent earnings calls and interviews. A notable component of this plan is the integration of advertising within the Disney+ platform. Recognizing the need to evolve in the competitive streaming landscape, Iger's emphasis on advertising reflects Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s commitment to adapt and thrive in the evolving market.Investor attention is now shifting toward legacy media companies like Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), all of which possess significant pay-TV network portfolios. Bob Iger's recent statement that traditional TV may not align with Disney's core strategy has put these companies in the spotlight, with investors closely monitoring their responses, including the potential consideration of a sale, in the face of a rapidly changing media landscape.In light of the most recent news and industry trends, it's time to uncover the 12 best streaming and TV stocks to buy now.12 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy NowCopyright: lculig / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyTo compile our list of 12 best streaming and TV stocks, we first made a list of all streaming and TV companies in the US.

PARA’s Filmed Entertainment business has an exciting upcoming 2023 and 2024 movie slate with many high-profile franchises. Its TV Media segment is undergoing a restructuring to save on costs and PARA’s fresh array of global content is driving subscriber momentum worldwide across its direct-to-consumer platform. Meanwhile, management is magnifying its focus on profitability for the streaming service and moderating investments in content, which should drive free cash flow in 2024 and beyond. In our view, the company’s long-term opportunity in streaming and the value of its proprietary content remain meaningfully underappreciated at current trading levels.”7.

Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD). The analyst raised the price target on Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) from $14 to $15 while maintaining their ""Hold"" rating on the stock. Venkateshwar's analysis was based on Warner Bros. Discovery's Q2 2023 earnings, which were reported on August 3, 2023. In his evaluation, he placed particular emphasis on the company's top-line performance. The analyst acknowledged that licensing revenues had contributed positively to the quarter's results, but he also highlighted the ongoing challenges faced by core media trends. Looking ahead to streaming growth for FY 2024, Venkateshwar expressed the view that it hinges on the success of implementing sharp price increases as normalized content and marketing investments decrease.Looking ahead, Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD)'s management provided guidance for the third quarter of 2023, anticipating adjusted EBITDA in the range of the low end of $11 billion to $11.5 billion, accompanied by free cash flow estimated at $1.7 billion. Additionally, for the fiscal year 2023, the company expects adjusted EBITDA to be ""U.S. DTC profitable"" and segment losses to amount to a couple of hundred million dollars.

Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD) in its investor letter for the second quarter of 2023:“Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) – Media conglomerate Warner Bros Discovery was the top detractor in the quarter but remained a top contributor for the first half. After a strong first quarter, the stock price faltered in the face of near-term uncertainty around the re-launch of streaming service Max. Additionally, the big budget movie The Flash has not been a success. Finally, there was well-publicized drama around CNN management, with CNN CEO Chris Licht leaving the company after only one year, which we believe was a positive resolution. The company remains dramatically undervalued today, and management continues to make positive operational progress to drive free cash flow (FCF) growth. We believe this company has seen the worst so will be less leveraged and more strategically positioned in the quarters and years to come. Its underlying holdings are high quality businesses that will drive FCF per share growth while also being attractive acquisition candidates.”Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy Now.Suggested Articles:10 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside14 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now11 Crypto Stocks with Biggest Upside Disclosure: None. 12 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Looking at TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), it does have a high ROCE right now, but lets see how returns are trending.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for TJX Companies:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.28 = US$5.1b ÷ (US$29b - US$10b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).So, TJX Companies has an ROCE of 28%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Specialty Retail industry average of 13%. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for TJX Companies compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at TJX Companies, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 47% where it was five years ago. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In summary, TJX Companies is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 70% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.If you want to continue researching TJX Companies, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.TJX Companies is not the only stock earning high returns.

100,aa0b01b0-799d-3eaf-a101-5ed952f573d2,NOV,2023-09-23,Inside plans to make Britain’s biggest energy port a hydrogen powerhouse,The Telegraph,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/aa0b01b0-799d-3eaf-a101-5ed952f573d2/inside-plans-to-make.html,1695466800,STORY,"['CL=F', 'NG=F']","[Pembroke Power StationDozens of ships arrive each week in the Milford Haven Waterway, many bearing vast cargoes of crude oil and natural gas.In one form or another, the Welsh port is a conduit for more than a quarter of Britain’s energy supplies.It was here that shipment after shipment of liquified natural gas (LNG) landed last winter, to be regasified and sent on to Europe by pipeline as the continent resisted Vladimir Putin’s attempt to throttle supplies.Yet in the coming decades, its role will change as the UK moves away from oil and gas and towards renewable sources of energy.If local business leaders get their way, Milford Haven will be invented as a powerhouse of hydrogen production, carbon capture and offshore wind power as part of the shift to net zero.“Right now, we’re sitting on the horizon of a new epoch in the waterway’s history,” says Tom Sawyer, chief executive of the port of Milford Haven.“It’s a really big opportunity for us - and everyone here gets that.”The Haven is a key part of the “South Wales Industrial Cluster”, a grouping that also includes Swansea, Port Talbot and Newport. The area hosts industries as varied as steelmaking and paper production and accounts for one quarter of Wales’ total carbon emissions and about 5pc of total UK emissions – meaning that if the country is to decarbonise, so must Milford Haven.The groundwork is already being laid for a major overhaul.RWE operates the Pembroke Power Station on the south side of the waterway. The facility is currently one of the largest and most efficient gas power stations in Europe. But within the next two years, bosses will have to make key decisions about its future.“If you just carried on with business-as-usual, then effectively you would have to close on December 31, 2034,” says Roland Long, site manager of Pembroke Power Station. “So you ask yourself, what are the options?”Roland Long, site manager of Pembroke Power StationRWE is considering turning the power station green by capturing direct emissions from its gas-fired units and storing them. The emissions would have to be converted into liquified CO2 and then transported elsewhere – probably to be piped into emptied oil and gas reservoirs underneath the North Sea.Story continuesAt the same time, the German company is exploring the development of two “green” hydrogen production plants where electrolysers would convert water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity.It is also looking at the possibility of an on-site battery storage plant. And land has been set aside for a separate, “blue” hydrogen facility where natural gas would be combined with steam to produce hydrogen.All options are on the table.“We’ve got engineers here working on this right now,” says Long. “What do we need if we do carbon capture? How would we actually extend the life of this plant? It’s about the absolute details, so it’s quite an exciting time for people to work in the power industry.”The oil and chemical tanker Bro Deliverer sits moored on the quayside at Milford Haven waterway - Ben Stansall / AFPHydrogen could potentially allow neighbouring facilities such as the Valero oil refinery, capable of producing 270,000 barrels of oil per day, to decarbonise jobs that involve heating. Instead of natural gas, hydrogen could be used to power industrial processes.However, significant parts of the investment case for projects in Milford Haven depend on other projects being developed elsewhere.For example, the green electricity that will power RWE’s electrolysers is expected to come from new floating wind farms off the coast in the Celtic Sea. The Crown Estate estimates there is potential for 20 gigawatts of capacity out there - equivalent to roughly 1,000 skyscraper-sized turbines.But in the Government’s latest renewable subsidies auction, no bids were received by offshore wind farm developers because the prices offered were too low. That puts a question mark over Milford Haven’s green energy supply.There will also need to be new infrastructure built to transport the hydrogen across South Wales.The Valero Pembroke Refinery in Milford Haven - Matthew Horwood/GettySarah Williams, director of asset strategy at gas network operator Wales &amp; West Utilities, says her company is currently exploring plans for an 80-mile steel pipeline called HyLine Cymru.But the project cannot go ahead without guarantees that there will be both production of hydrogen locally and - most crucially - willing customers.“This would be a major project to support industry,” Williams says. “But there’s clearly no point in building a pipeline if we can’t confirm the hydrogen is going to be available to go through it or if there are no customers who are going to use it.”Some of the demand is expected to come from transport. South Wales Transport is currently trialling buses that use hydrogen fuel cells, for example.However, a string of big industrial users must sign up for the sums to stack up.Against that backdrop, a recent decision by Tata Steel to wind down its coal-fired blast furnaces in Port Talbot and replace them with electric arc systems has delivered a blow.The change means the end of steel production from ore at the plant, a process which could have been done using hydrogen instead of fossil fuels. The factory is instead switching to using scrap metal to make recycled steel, a process that will be powered by electricity likely generated by nearby wind farms.The busy Pembroke dock and the oil and gas terminals at Milford Haven - Phillip Roberts / AlamyMeanwhile, the port of Milford Haven is busy upgrading its own infrastructure in preparation for what it predicts will be a wind power boom. Changes include new “laydown” areas to make it easier for companies to work on large components such as turbine towers and blades, as well as “super slipways” to help transport the parts.While the recent government auction failed to generate any bids for offshore wind projects, Sawyer believes future rounds are bound to yield results given the potential of the Celtic Sea.“You’ve got more than 1,000, very, very large turbines going up,” Sawyer adds. “They’ll need businesses that can make anchors, chains, cabling, so you need welders, fabricators and mechanical and electrical engineers - there’s just this enormous opportunity.”Combined plans could inject £6bn into local economyEven if Port Talbot won’t be using hydrogen for its electric arc furnaces, Sawyer argues the recycled steel the plant will produce should be suitable for making the wind turbines.“I actually see the steel announcement at Port Talbot as fantastic, because that was always going to be the long pole in the tent.”The port of Milford Haven has applied for grant funding from the Government to help finance the work. If all goes to plan, it is hoped the combined plans in the South Wales Industrial Cluster could add £6bn to the local economy.The port is also bidding to become a freeport, which will unlock tax breaks such as business rates relief for all the new infrastructure that is planned. Speedy planning consents and upgrades to local grid capacity are also seen as vital.“We want to win this competition,” says Sawyer. “And we see ourselves competing with Portugal and Norway and the Far East to win this business.“It’s genuinely a once in a generation opportunity - and it finally feels like there is momentum building behind us.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

The bank cited lower OPEC output combined with higher demand, which taken together, ""more than offset significantly higher U.S. supply.""The average gas price in the U.S. on September 20 was $3.875, slightly lower than a day earlier but $0.20 higher than a year ago.Even with higher gas prices, EV purchases have slowed down instead of rising.In Europe, the deindustrialization of Germany is no longer news, the car industry is bracing for a Chinese EV rush, and Brussels is trying to build an energy transition supply chain from scratch.Meanwhile, offshore wind developers are canceling projects in both Europe and the U.S., solar developers in the EU are complaining about cheap Chinese panels.Also meanwhile, oil and gas companies keep reporting meaty profits and investors are rediscovering their love of hydrocarbons.The energy transition is backfiring.At the recent World Petroleum Congress in Calgary, oil executives and government officials both warned against the continued push to discourage investment in new hydrocarbon production.""There seems to be wishful thinking that we're going to flip a switch from where we're at today to where it will be tomorrow,"" Exxon's chief executive said during the event.""No matter where demand gets to, if we don't maintain some level of investment industry, you end up running shorter supply which leads to higher prices,"" Darren Woods also said.This is exactly what we are currently witnessing in Europe and the United States. Because of the transition push, oil producers are being extra cautious with production growth. Also, they are prioritizing shareholder returns to keep shareholders on, so it pays for them to be cautious.In Europe, the supermajors are being squeezed by windfall profit taxes, activist pressure, and increasingly restrictive legislation, so they are turning elsewhere. Shell is tapping billions of potential barrels in Namibia, and Total is considering a $9-billion commitment to oil exploration in Suriname.Story continuesMeanwhile, drivers across Europe are struggling with higher fuel costs and higher electricity bills as the EU becomes increasingly dependent on intermittent wind and solar that need backup from hydrocarbon-fueled power plants. These plants are taxed heavily for their carbon emissions, which has pushed the cost of their output—and electricity bills—higher.All of this is only going to get worse before it gets better. Because despite a growing number of signs that the transition is not going according to plan, those in the driver's seat are doubling down on every single commitment.The offshore wind energy industry is essentially on its deathbed, yet there has been no change of attitude from governments. The most likely thing they would do about its problems will probably be even more subsidies instead of a reconsideration of the role offshore wind would play in the transition.In EVs, dealers are struggling with rising inventories in the U.S., and Ford said recently it was going to book a $4.5 billion loss on its EV business. In Europe, sales are up strongly, but carmakers are fretting about Chinese EVs, which are just as good as theirs but cheaper.Solar energy is doing great in the U.S., set for record growth of 32 GW this year, ""helped by investment incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act,"" Reuters reported recently. It appears nobody really cares what happens when the sun goes down over all those gigawatts. Battery storage is far behind solar in terms of capacity.Solar is doing great in the EU, too, also thanks to heavy subsidies, only there is a shortage of qualified installers, and local panel producers are grumbling against Chinese imports that are, according to the industry, killing them.So the EU recently essentially declared a selective trade war on China through the mouth of EC president Ursula von der Leyen. China warned there would be consequences—at a time when the country has become a major exporter of fuels to Europe thanks to the Russian fuel embargo.The price of energy is going to continue higher in both Europe and the U.S. All because of an ill-conceived transition away from hydrocarbons.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Oil And Gas Workers’ Association Endorses Trump For 2024 VoteChinese Fuel Oil Imports Continue To Dip From Decade-HighNigeria Secures $13 Billion In Investment Pledges From Big OilRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Rates that high are bound to spark more pain for small firms, he said, which are already suffering from what O'Leary calls a ""cash crisis"" amid a higher cost of borrowing.""That's going to really hurt small businesses,"" O'Leary said. He previously estimated that small businesses employ 60% of the US workforce.Central bankers have raised interest rates aggressively over the past 18 months to control inflation, with rates now at their highest level since 2001. Prices are still well-above the Fed's 2% target, with inflation accelerating to 3.7% year-over-year in August, per the latest Consumer Price Index report.Part of that is due to higher energy prices, which were the biggest driver of inflation last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Oil prices have stuck close to a 10-month high, with Brent crude the international benchmark, trading around $94 a barrel on Friday while West Texas Intermediate crude traded around $91 a barrel..O'Leary blamed high oil prices on a systemic shortage of crude production. The US is producing around 12 million  barrels of crude a day, though demand will likely require that to rise to 18 million barrels a day, O'Leary estimated. That will need to be resolved by producing more barrels in addition to more oil refineries, which process crude into products like diesel and gasoline.Story continues""This is not brain surgery,"" he said. ""We have to do this or we're going to be in real trouble in three years on the whole oil issue.""Forecasters have warned that oil prices could go even higher through the end of the year as supply cuts from producers in OPEC+ could deepen. More supply pressure could potentially push Brent crude up to $120 a barrel, JPMorgan strategists warned, a level that could push inflation higher and bring economic growth to a halt in coming quarters.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

One such stock that merits attention is NRG Energy Inc (NYSE:NRG). The stock, which is currently priced at 38.63, recorded a gain of 1.95% in a day and a 3-month increase of 11.83%. The stock's fair valuation is $58.44, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NRG. Click here to check it out. NRG 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NRGThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is NRG Energy (NRG) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapDecoding the RisksHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with NRG Energy should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score of 1, Altman Z-score of 1.04, and a Beneish M-Score of 59.36 that exceeds -1.78, the threshold for potential earnings manipulation. These indicators suggest that NRG Energy, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesUnderstanding Key Financial IndicatorsThe Piotroski F-score, created by accounting professor Joseph Piotroski, is a tool used to assess the strength of a company's financial health. The score is based on nine criteria that fall into three categories: profitability, leverage/liquidity/ source of funds, and operating efficiency. The overall score ranges from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating healthier financials. NRG Energy's current Piotroski F-Score, however, falls in the lower end of this spectrum, indicating potential red flags for investors.Before delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Developed by Professor Messod Beneish, the Beneish M-Score is based on eight financial variables that reflect different aspects of a company's financial performance and position. These are Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), Gross Margin (GM), Total Long-term Assets Less Property, Plant and Equipment over Total Assets (TATA), change in Revenue (?REV), change in Depreciation and Amortization (?DA), change in Selling, General and Admin expenses (?SGA), change in Debt-to-Asset Ratio (?LVG), and Net Income Less Non-Operating Income and Cash Flow from Operations over Total Assets (?NOATA).Company SnapshotNRG Energy is one of the largest retail energy providers in the U.S., with 5.5 million customers. Its 2023 acquisition of Vivint Smart Home adds 1.9 million home services customers. NRG also is one of the largest U.S. independent power producers, with 13 gigawatts of coal, gas, and oil power generation capacity primarily in Texas. NRG exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a stand-alone entity in December 2003.Is NRG Energy (NRG) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapAnalysis of NRG Energy's ProfitabilityFirstly, let's address profitability. One significant component of the F-Score is a positive return on assets (ROA). A closer look at NRG Energy's ROA reveals a worrying trend of negative returns. This indicates the company's inability to generate profit from its assets - a fundamental concern for any investor.Let's delve deeper into NRG Energy's financial health by examining the decline in its return on assets (ROA) over the past three years. The data indicates 2021: 6.67; 2022: 12.59; 2023: -6.65, when expressed in percentages. Such a decrease is concerning, as the Piotroski F-Score penalizes companies with lower current ROA compared to the previous period. This ongoing decline highlights another potential risk associated with investing in NRG Energy.Observing the financials of NRG Energy, it's important to note that the cash flow from operations over the trailing twelve months (TTM) stands at $-3857 million, whereas the net income in the same period is significantly higher at $-2055 million. The Piotroski F-score considers this discrepancy as a potential red flag. The rationale behind this is that a company's operating cash flow is a more direct and less manipulated measure of its cash-generating ability than net income. Net income, while important, is susceptible to accounting treatments and non-cash items which can distort the true cash profitability of the company. If a company consistently shows lower cash flows from operations relative to its net income, it could indicate that the earnings quality is poor and the company might have difficulties sustaining its operations or financing its obligations, a fact which could negatively impact its financial stability and investor confidence.Leverage, Liquidity and Source of Funds: A Worrying TrendIs NRG Energy (NRG) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapExamining NRG Energy's financial stability, there's a notable decrease in its current ratio over the past three years, as shown by the data 2021: 1.24; 2022: 1.29; 2023: 1.02, which is expressed as percentages. The current ratio is a key indicator of a company's short-term financial health, as it gauges the ability to cover short-term liabilities with short-term assets. A declining current ratio suggests that NRG Energy's liquidity and capability to manage immediate financial obligations are deteriorating.Operating Efficiency: A Darker PictureLastly, concerning operating efficiency, the Piotroski F-score examines changes in gross margin and asset turnover. Regrettably, NRG Energy follows a discouraging trajectory with a decrease in gross margin percentage over the past three years, as demonstrated by the data provided: 2021: 25.95; 2022: 25.45; 2023: 0.22 (expressed in percentages). This contraction in gross margin suggests that NRG Energy is grappling with either an escalation in the cost of goods sold or dwindling prices - both of which are inauspicious indicators for profitability.While the Piotroski F-score is not the only lens through which to view a potential investment, it is a robust and comprehensive tool for evaluating a company's financial health. Unfortunately for NRG Energy, its current score suggests potential troubles.NRG Energy's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of NRG Energy's Altman Z-score reveals NRG Energy's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:When it comes to operational efficiency, a vital indicator for NRG Energy is its asset turnover. The data: 2021: 1.13; 2022: 1.06; 2023: 0.99 from the past three years suggests a recent decline following an initial increase in this ratio. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. Therefore, a drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in NRG Energy's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.The days sales outstanding (DSO) is an important financial metric that denotes the average time a company takes to collect payment after a sale is completed. Looking at the historical data from the past three years (2021: 1.13; 2022: 1.06; 2023: 0.99), there appears to be a rising trend in NRG Energy's DSO.An uptick in DSO might indicate aggressive revenue recognition practices, and in some cases, potential earnings manipulation. To explain, when DSO increases, it means the company's receivables are growing. This could be a result of sales being recorded before customers have paid, which inflates the revenue figures. In extreme cases, a company may even recognize revenue from sales that may never be collected, an action that is considered earnings manipulation. A rising DSO figure warrants scrutiny as it can signal financial distress or questionable accounting practices within the company. Therefore, investors should closely monitor such trends for early detection of any potential financial risks.The Gross Margin index tracks the evolution of a company's gross profit as a proportion of its revenue. A downward trend could indicate issues such as overproduction or more generous credit terms, both of which are potential red flags for earnings manipulation. By examining the past three years of NRG Energy's historical data (2021: 25.95; 2022: 25.45; 2023: 0.22), we find that its Gross Margin has contracted by 28.89%. Such a contraction in the gross margin can negatively impact the companyThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

David French, NRF Senior Vice President of Government Relations joins Yahoo Finance’s Seana Smith and Brad Smith to assess how credit card fees and the general state of the economy will impact holiday spending.French says he still sees “signs of weaknesses” despite the average American household having savings to last them through the end of the year. With tighter credit conditions, French expects consumers to hold onto their money, predicting that consumers will cut back on discretionary spending— specifically for services.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: What's your assessment of the consumer today? Because here we are with inflation much stickier than many of the forecasts had expected we would be at, when it comes to the current levels right now. The economy is showing signs of some weakening here, when we take a look at the labor market showing some signs here of slowing down. Is the consumer do you think still able or still likely to remain resilient in the coming months, when we look ahead to the very critical holiday season?DAVID FRENCH: So at the moment, American households have about, I think, today is $500 billion in excess savings. That's a cushion. That's going to hold the consumer in a good place through the end of the year, we expect. But, certainly, in the future, tighter credit conditions and other factors are going to test that resiliency a little bit.BRAD SMITH: a swipe fees are increased, what impact would that have on inflation that the Fed can-- they can do all of the policy decision making in their purview. But they're not going to come out with any ruling on swipe fees.DAVID FRENCH: No. Swipe fees-- the question isn't if. It's when. Because there's no competition in the market for credit card swipe fees. Swipe fees always go up. In fact, swipe fees have gone up about 60% since the beginning of the pandemic. Just $22 billion in extra swipe fees last year alone. So we know they're going up. Competition will help retailers and merchants bring those fees back under control.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: While we have you, we've been taking a look through the NRF's outlook for the rest of this year, and especially the holiday season, what s type of spending level expectation or even category expectation, given the number of people that have shifted their spending from goods and into services, and how that is really continuing to drive some of the purchases that are being made. How is that continued to expect-- how is that expected to continue showing up in the data once we get into this holiday season?DAVID FRENCH: Sure. Obviously, there's been a shift back to services, maybe not as much as we expected following the easing of the pandemic. As consumers continue to look forward to their spending choices, we expect consumers will protect their essential spending and pare back in some areas on discretionary spending, including discretionary services.SEANA SMITH: All right. David French, always great to get your insight there. National Retail Federation Senior Vice President of Government Relations. Thanks.DAVID FRENCH: Thanks for having me.]"

These forms of payments were growing at a high clip, but the social distancing restrictions forced many to turn to electronic and digital payments as a means to acquire the items they needed.As a result, the increase in the number of people holding a bank account, which would be needed to pay a credit card bill, grew tremendously during the worst of the pandemic. As recently as 2011, only 51% of adults globally had a bank account. That number improved to 68% by 2017, but jumped to 76% by 2021. This is a remarkable increase in a few short years.Current Trends in Digital PaymentsWarning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with DFS. Click here to check it out. DFS 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DFSIn 2022, nearly two-thirds of all U.S. transactions were made with some card, such as credit, debit, or prepaid. Add in the number of electronic payments made through online bill pay and these methods of payments made up 75% of all transactions last year. By comparison, less than a quarter of transactions were conducted with cash, check, or money order.Figures like this are similar in our developed countries, but it was not the same for lower- and middle-income economies. That has changed due to Covid-19. Prior to the pandemic, it is estimated that approximately 40% of consumers used electronic and digital payments worldwide. Post-pandemic, that number increased to nearly 60% in just three years.Future of Digital PaymentsThese figures are expected to continue to increase in the years ahead as more people around the world become more comfortable with electronic and digital payments. In fact, more than 90% of consumers that have a digital wallet expect that they will continue to use it for purchases.In short, electronic and digital payments are not going anywhere and it is very likely that more consumers will choose to make their purchases in this manner. Therefore, investors interested in this space should focus on high-quality companies that have a dominating market position. Fortunately, there are several names that stand out as possible investment choices, including Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), and Visa Inc (NYSE:V). All three of which happen to be trading at a discount to their intrinsic value.Story continuesDiscover Financial ServicesFirst up is Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) which is a holding company that provides various financial services to its customers. The company has generated revenue of nearly $16 billion over the last year and is valued at just under $22 billion.Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) operates two business segments, Digital Banking and Payment Services. The Payment Services business provides payment processing and settlement services. Direct Banking provides credit cards under the namesake brand Discover as well as loans for individuals and homes and deposit products.Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) has a solid GF Score of 83 out of 100 from GuruFocus, implying the potential for modest returns going forward. Solid ratings for value, growth, and profitability are offset by weaker results for momentum and financial strength.3 Names to Benefit From Growth in Electronic PaymentsDiscover's Investment PotentialThe GF Value Line, however, shows that the stock could be significantly undervalued based on historical ratios, past financial performance, and future earnings projections.

The dividend yield of 3.2% is one of the highest in the fin tech industry. The company has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years.3 Names to Benefit From Growth in Electronic PaymentsMasterCard IncNext up is Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), one of the largest processors of electronic payments in the world. The company is valued at $382 billion and has produced sales of $24 billion over the last twelve months.Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA)s primary competitive advantages is the sheer size of its business. The company partners with more than 25,000 financial institutions around the world and has more than 3 billion cards in use. Due to its size and scale, Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) is likely to be one of the primary beneficiaries of more the worlds population moving to electronic and digital payments.Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) has an impressive GF Score of 97 out of 100, which is one of the highest scores in the market. This means that the likelihood that the stock will deliver outperformance is high. Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) has perfect scores in the areas of profitability and growth, a near perfect showing for momentum, and moderate results for value and financial strength.3 Names to Benefit From Growth in Electronic PaymentsMasterCard's Investment PotentialThe stocks GF Value Line suggests that the stock is modestly undervalued. With a GF Value of $485.58, shares are trading at a nearly 20% discount to intrinsic value. The stocks yield is just 0.6%, but Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) has raised its dividend for 12 consecutive years.3 Names to Benefit From Growth in Electronic PaymentsVisa IncThe final name for consideration is Visa Inc (NYSE:V), the global leader in digital payments. The company has a market capitalization of $483 billion and has generated close to $32 billion in revenue over the last year.As with Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), Visa Inc (NYSE:V) benefits from its tremendous payment network. The company has operations in more than 200 countries and can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second. Visa Inc (NYSE:V) had more than 4 billion cards in use as of its most recent quarterly filing. Visa Inc (NYSE:V) should also continue to benefit from the trend towards electronic and digital payments due to its reach.Visa Inc (NYSE:V) has a GF Score of 98 out of 100, implying that the stock could also see strong returns.

More people than ever have a bank account around the world, which has led to spikes in the number of payments done with something other than cash.This ongoing transition should benefit the largest names in the fin tech space. Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), and Visa Inc (NYSE:V) are three names that should continue to perform well as more of the world conducts its business electronically and digitally.Each name is also trading at a double-digit discount to its GF Value.

With one of the biggest footprints in the communist nation by a U.S.-based firm, the market uncertainties seem to be taking a toll on its stock-market performance. Moreover, as China accounts for the lion’s share of Qualcomm’s revenues, any disruption in local operation is bound to have a ripple effect across the company.The chip-making firm has a significant presence in more than 12 cities in China, aiming to drive advancements in semiconductors and mobile telecommunications for the larger benefit. The company has been a key supplier of chips and other related components to local smartphone manufacturers like Xiaomi, Huawei and its spin-off brand Honor. However, it appears that Qualcomm is increasingly finding it difficult to maintain its operations in China.Much of these hardships can be attributed to the continued Sino-U.S. trade spat. The U.S. Commerce Department has long imposed various trade restrictions against China that banned the sale of high-tech equipment, chips, components and related technology to develop high-end smartphones and AI-enabled chips. Despite adding China-based Huawei to the ‘Entity List,’ the newly developed Huawei Mate 60 smartphone is believed to have violated the U.S. trade sanctions. This has forced the U.S. watchdog to enforce stricter trade restrictions while conducting the authenticity of the trade violations.This, in turn, is believed to have led to a tit-for-tat action against Apple Inc. AAPL, with various media reports claiming a purported move by Beijing to impose a ban on the use of iPhones in government offices and state-backed entities as part of its concerted effort toward self-reliance. The restrictions on Apple are likely to have a profound effect on Qualcomm, which is one of the leading suppliers to the iPhone manufacturing firm.Over the years, China has been one of the primary markets for Apple. As the news of the purported ban spread like wildfire, Apple’s shares slumped and wiped nearly $200 billion in market capitalization. This further affected its suppliers like Qualcomm, among others. Qualcomm modems have been a key feature in iPhone models, connecting the device to cellular networks for fast web browsing and instant app access. Built on indigenous technology that requires specialized engineering expertise and broad industry know-how, these modems have been the hallmark of impeccable performance standards.The impact is further likely to be compounded by the fact that Qualcomm recently entered into a multi-year agreement with Apple to supply Snapdragon 5G Modem-RF systems for all the upcoming iPhone models.Amid such adversities, Qualcomm is reportedly undertaking job cuts and retrenchments to sustain its business. Local media reports claim that the company has laid off dozens of people from its research and development facility in Shanghai, raising questions about its long-term viability plans.However, China-based firms like Honor have vouched to continue procuring core chips from Qualcomm despite nationalist calls to support domestic manufacturers. It stated that QCOM chips enable efficient optimization of Honor handsets and enrich its performance standards. Moreover, it has historically supplied older-generation 4G chips to Huawei, which are believed to be safe and do not jeopardize national security interests. Consequently, the company is likely to avoid any penal action by the U.S. Commerce Department regarding any wrongdoings that harm the safety and integrity of the nation.In the backdrop of these events, we believe that the company will strive to maintain an optimum balance between its China operations and conforming to the national interests of both countries. Although shares did have a knee-jerk reaction triggered by the sudden developments, we expect the company to strike the right chords in the near future.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company confirmed the layoffs but has not disclosed the exact number of job reductions. This move follows Qualcomm's previously announced expectations of ""workforce reductions"" in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 as part of its restructuring efforts to invest in key growth opportunities.Despite the layoffs, Qualcomm has denied plans for an office closure or a complete withdrawal from Shanghai, according to China Business News. An anonymous employee also confirmed that the layoffs were underway, but suggested they were not extensive.The company, which has a presence in over 12 Chinese cities primarily for its semiconductor and mobile telecommunications businesses, has emphasized its commitment to developing advanced technology in China. It is offering generous redundancy packages to affected employees.Qualcomm's decision comes in the wake of a challenging financial period. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, it reported a 23% year-on-year drop in revenue and a 52% decline in net income due to weak demand for consumer electronics.Additional pressure comes from ongoing US-China trade tensions and Beijing’s partial ban on iPhone usage by government staff, as Qualcomm is a major supplier to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, the successful launch of the new iPhone 15 in Mainland China could alleviate some of these challenges.The broader smartphone market in China has also faced difficulties, with a 4% decline in sales during the second quarter of 2023, marking the lowest second-quarter sales since 2014, according to market research firm Counterpoint. Other US chip companies have likewise announced job cuts in China amid these economic challenges and industrial downturns.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with META. Click here to check it out. LMT 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of LMTAs of 2023-09-22, Lockheed Martin Corp(NYSE:LMT)'s intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $520.58. It's currently trading at a price of $417.54. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 19.79%. The company is modestly undervalued.Unlocking Intrinsic Value: A Deep Dive into Lockheed Martin CorpThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Lockheed Martin Corp(NYSE:LMT)'s intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$27.35GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.48%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 12.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=296.15Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=224.44Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=520.58Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $665.69. This valuation indicates that the Lockheed Martin Corp(NYSE:LMT) is significantly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 37.28%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

126,2c324a6c-eb8b-31cc-bc4c-bb0564912e4c,JNJ,2023-09-23,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-johnson-johnson-130012213.html,1695387612,STORY,['JNJ'],"[Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned -2.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.4% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Johnson &amp; Johnson belongs, has lost 9.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.52 per share, indicating a change of -1.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.03 points to a change of -1.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -6.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.89 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Johnson &amp; Johnson.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate of $21.61 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -9.2%. The $84.48 billion and $89.54 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -11% and +6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $25.53 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.3%. EPS of $2.80 for the same period compares with $2.59 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.43%. The EPS surprise was +7.28%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), The Boeing Company (BA) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Amazon.com shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+54.0% vs. +33.2%). The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive.Additionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. Robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives.Amazon.com’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. However, inflationary pressure, geopolitical tensions and foreign currency headwinds remain concerns.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Sares of Boeing have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the year-to-date period (+5.0% vs. -15.6%). The company remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. During the second quarter, this jet giant booked 460 net commercial airplane orders and recorded a 10% hike in service revenues.A strengthening U.S. defense budget should also boost Boeing’s growth. The company holds a strong solvency position in the near term. However, Boeing expects supply-chain disruptions to continue to harm its operational results, at least in the near term.Further, the company has been incurring notable abnormal production cost in relation to production quality issues for 787 jets that may hurt its future results. Its dispute with Embraer over termination of the earlier made joint venture might cause Boeing to incur some loss in the future.(You can read the full research report on Boeing here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Regeneron shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the year-to-date period (+14.1% vs. -14.8%).  The company maintains momentum on asthma drug Dupixent’s stellar performance, driven by continued strong demand in the approved indications. Growth in Dupixent through additional label expansions and a promising late-stage pipeline set the momentum for further development.The approval of Libtayo for additional indications is likely to drive the drug’s sales and diversify the company’s portfolio. Additionally, the company received a significant boost with the FDA approval of a higher dose of aflibercept at 8mg.Regeneron has a deep pipeline and the development of additional drugs will be an incremental boost to the company. However, lead drug Eylea sales are under pressure due to increasing competition. A decline in Eylea sales will hurt Regeneron's performance.Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX), Altria Group, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) leads the global smartphone market with a market share of 28.52%, as of August 2023. This means that every third user among 10 smartphone users worldwide uses Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KRX:005930) follows Apple Inc.

According to Deloitte 2023 Technology Industry Outlook, tech giants are investing massively in the healthcare sector. Tech companies are adding efficient and innovative technologies to the healthcare sector that are ready to bring digital transformation to healthcare. The global digital health market is projected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2030 from an estimated $211 billion in 2022. That reflects a massive potential for tech companies to explore this growth opportunity in health care.  Let's discuss two tech giants that are innovating in the healthcare space.Deloitte’s report on the tech industry outlook highlights that the Big Five invested more than $3 billion into health care in 2021, in disclosed venture capital investments. Leading technologies such as virtual health care, augmented reality, cloud, predictive analytics, remote patient monitoring, and wearable devices have a growing impact on transforming health and well-being.In the last few years, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been penetrating the healthcare sector. On February 22, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced that it closed a deal with primary care provider One Medical for $3.9 billion. With the acquisition of One Medical, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) expanded its footprint in the healthcare industry. Through One Medical, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) will reach a wider audience to offer better healthcare experience and services.

One Medical has set the bar for what a quality, convenient, and affordable primary care experience should be like. We’re inspired by their human-centered, technology-forward approach and excited to help them continue to grow and serve more patients.”Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has planned for a long time to expand its network in the healthcare sector. Today, the e-commerce giant has a healthcare subsidiary, Amazon Clinic, which offers 24/7 virtual healthcare service through video calls and messaging. After the launch of Amazon Clinic in November 2022, the virtual care network has received a 96% customer satisfaction rating. On August 1, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced that they are expanding Amazon Clinic’s services all over the U.S. At the moment, Amazon Clinic does not offer insurance, but patients can use insurance to pay for medications prescribed through Amazon Clinic. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also offering its online pharmacy through Amazon Pharmacy, which handles fulfillment and delivery of prescriptions.Another tech giant, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is creating partnerships with payers, clinical researchers, and healthcare systems through its products like Apple Watch and iPhone. Moreover, Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) wearable technology in its Apple Watch has healthcare apps that allow its users to create a healthy life. Apple Watch also supports its users with other aspects of health including heart health, activity, medications, and mobility, among others. As we mentioned earlier, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in this year’s launch event unveiled the Apple Watch Series 9, which has a powerful new S9 SiP chip with enhanced performance and capabilities, providing access to health data.20 Most Innovative Companies in AmericaOur MethodologyTo find the 20 most innovative companies in America, we followed a consensus approach.

While some analysts are more skeptical about Nike’s short-term progress potential in Q1, most remained confident in the Swoosh’s potential for long-term growth.More from Footwear NewsThe 16 Best Trail Running Shoes of 2023, Tested by ExpertsOregon Football Will Wear Color-Changing Nike Dunk Cleats for Its Game Against Colorado“China recovery uncertainty and lingering questions of brand/product strength could remain in focus,” wrote Baird analyst Jonathan Komp in a note to investors this week, adding that recovery in China appears “lackluster” given macroeconomic headwinds in the region and softer performance from local retailers there.Stifel managing director Jim Duffy also warned of potential headwinds for Nike in China and North America this quarter, noting that comments on both regions will be “under particular scrutiny” during the call next week.“Nike continues to outperform western competitors in the region but soft consumer spending is an impediment,” Duffy wrote. “Our investor conversations suggest commentary on a softer China is well anticipated into the report.”However, despite potential slowdowns in North America and China, Duffy said he still views Nike’s full year guidance as “achievable.”In June, Nike said it expects fiscal year 2024 revenues to grow in the mid-single digits, accounting for headwinds from wholesale shipping timing from the prior year. In Q1, Nike expects revenues to be flat to up in the low single digits due to its efforts to reduce excess inventory. In Q4, North America revenues grew 5 percent and Greater China revenue grew 25 percent.In a call with investors in June, Nike CEO and president John Donahoe said the company would continue to invest in China with innovations and hyper-local activations. The company also noted that it had a record-breaking performance during the 6/18 shopping holiday in China, and was the No.1 sports brand on Tmall, Alibaba’s China e-commerce service. Nike is also seeing returns among Gen Z in China from its focus on combining innovation with local storytelling.Story continuesNot all analysts were concerned with Nike’s potential for recovery in China. UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a note this week that he is “bullish on Nike’s long-term growth prospects in China,” citing data from a recent UBS consumer survey analyzing the market in the region. According to the survey, Nike ranks as the most premium brand in China, a region where consumers appear eager to trade up to the best quality sportswear.UBS also found that consumers in China are unlikely to be strongly motivated to purchase domestic sportswear brands as opposed to international brands like Nike.“We believe Nike has the brand strength, strategy, skills, resources, and balance sheet to outperform peers through a recession,” Sole wrote.As for North America, which has faced headwinds due to challenges in the wholesale market, UBS analysts said they expect sales in the region to “be challenged due to elevated inventory levels, tough compares, wholesale partner caution, and macroeconomic pressures weighing on consumers.”Jane Hali &amp; Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez also noted the potential for a slowdown in North America in Q1“We remain concerned on the consumer slowdown in North America as consumers continue to be hit by inflation and are spending more strategically across discretionary categories,” Ramirez wrote.Nike reports earnings for the first quarter on Thursday, Sept. 28.Best of Footwear NewsA History of Forever 21: From Humble Beginnings to Bankruptcy and the Shaquille O'Neal BouncebackFootwear Company CEOs You Should KnowList of Footwear Company CEOs You Should Know]"

NKE is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Sep 28. The leading sports apparel retailer is likely to have witnessed top-line growth in the fiscal first quarter, while its earnings per share are expected to have declined year over year.The company has been gaining from its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, along with strong demand, compelling products, and robust performance in its digital and DTC businesses. Supply-chain constraints, continued weakness in Greater China and higher costs have been weighing on its bottom-line performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is pegged at $13 billion, suggesting 2.3% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal first-quarter earnings is pegged at 73 cents per share, suggesting a decline of 21.5% from the year-ago reported number. Earnings estimates for the fiscal first quarter have been unchanged in the past 30 days.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 1.5%. Its bottom line beat the consensus estimate by 20.9%, on average, over the trailing four quarters.NIKE, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise NIKE, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNIKE, Inc. price-eps-surprise | NIKE, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteNIKE is expected to have witnessed continued gains from brand strength, robust consumer demand and an innovative product pipeline in the fiscal first quarter. Gains from its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, and robust digital and DTC performances are expected to have been other tailwinds.Continued strength in retail traffic trends within NIKE Direct has been boosting conversion rates. The strong member buying trends are likely to have led to a record digital performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Strength in the North America, EMEA and APLA regions, fueled by increasing traffic, higher conversion and growth in average order value, is likely to have aided sales in the to-be-reported quarter.The NIKE Direct business has been benefiting from robust growth across regions and an efficient digital ecosystem, which comprises its online site, and commercial and activity apps. Revenues at NIKE-owned stores are expected to have gained from improved traffic, higher conversion rates and growth in average order value. The NIKE Direct business is likely to have benefited from growth in North America, EMEA and APLA, offset by continued weakness in Greater China in the to-be-reported quarter.We expect total NIKE Brand revenues to increase 1.9% year over year to $12,272.7 million in the fiscal first quarter, driven by 1.6% growth in Direct-to-Consumer and a 2% rise in the Wholesale business.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management predicted flat to low-single-digit revenue growth for the fiscal first quarter.However, NKE has been witnessing a decline in the gross and operating margins due to rising costs, higher markdowns, increased freight and logistics costs, elevated input costs, and currency headwinds. Also, elevated SG&amp;A expenses are concerning.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company predicted a sequential improvement in the gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. It anticipated the gross margin to be down 50-75 basis points (bps) on a reported basis, whereas it reported a contraction of 140 basis points (bps) in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023.NIKE has been witnessing elevated SG&amp;A expenses, driven by increased demand creation expenses due to the normalization of sporting activities and overhead costs related to higher wages. Demand-creation expenses are likely to have increased in the fiscal first quarter, owing to elevated marketing and advertising investments. These investments are likely to have supported significant global sports moments and product launches, and investment in capabilities to transform NIKE's operating model for greater speed and effectiveness.Operating overhead expenses are expected to have resulted from higher wage-related expenses and NIKE Direct costs, as well as increased technology investments to support digital transformation in the to-be-reported quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected first-quarter fiscal 2024 SG&amp;A expenses to grow in the low-double digits, owing to increased demand creation investments.We anticipate the gross margin to decline 50 bps to 43.8%. Meanwhile, our estimate for SG&amp;A expenses of $4,360.5 million indicates a year-over-year rise of 11.2%. Driven by the soft gross margin and higher SG&amp;A expenses, our model suggests a 330-bps contraction in the operating margin to 10.1% in the fiscal first quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NIKE this time around.

This was first reported by Reuters.Particularly, cities led by Baltimore, San Diego and Philadelphia accused Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs GS, JPMorgan Chase JPM, Morgan Stanley MS, Royal Bank of Canada and Wells Fargo &amp; Company WFC of colluding to raise interest rates on more than 12,000 variable-rate demand obligations (VRDOs) from 2008 to 2016.VRDOs are long-term bonds with short-term rates that reset weekly. Banks remarket VRDOs that investors redeem at the least rates. The banks were accused of conspiring to artificially increase rates by sharing information about bond inventories and planned rate changes.Resultantly, funding availability was reduced for hospitals, power and water supplies, schools and transportation, causing billions of dollars in damages.The banks filed an opposing class certification, noting that differences among the bonds would require many individual examinations to determine if rate inflation occurred. This would make a single class-action lawsuit difficult.But now, the U.S. district judge has rejected the banks’ certification to require cities to pursue claims individually, likely lowering probable recoveries.""Of course, it remains an open question whether, assuming plaintiffs paid supra-competitive interest, that payment was caused by defendants' allegedly anti-competitive behavior,"" Furman noted.Recently, a lawsuit was filed in the New York state court against Morgan Stanley by private equity firms Certares Management LLC and Knighthead Capital Management LLC. The firms claim that MS used deceptive practices in relation to a credit agreement investment for a luxury high-speed rail line.The firms are seeking at least $750 million in damages from Morgan Stanley.

150,19413359-31b3-339a-a710-f1a1b534cae4,PFE,2023-09-23,RSV vaccine recommended during pregnancy as a second option to protect newborns,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rsv-vaccine-recommended-during-pregnancy-220854550.html,1695420534,STORY,['PFE'],"[NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. health officials on Friday recommended RSV vaccinations for moms-to-be, a second new option to protect newborns from serious lung infections.The shots should be given late in pregnancy but only during RSV season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.“This is another new tool we can use this fall and winter to help protect lives,” said CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen in a statement.Cohen signed off after a CDC advisory panel backed the vaccine. The only opposition came from a panel member who found the recommendation ""incredibly complicated.”A month ago, the agency recommended another option for infants to guard against severe RSV: lab-made antibodies given to babies younger than 8 months before their first RSV season. A single dose is given to babies by injection after they are born.Most infants will likely only need protection from one — either the mom's vaccine or the antibodies — but not both, Cohen said.There is no head-to-head study that answers which is more effective, and no published research on how safe it is to give both. And they are both expensive, although the cost will be ultimately covered by insurance.The RSV vaccine, made by Pfizer, should only be given between 32 weeks and 36 weeks of pregnancy. The shot prompts the moms-to-be to develop virus-fighting antibodies that pass through the placenta to the fetus. Protection in newborns likely drops after 6 months of age, so the shot is for use between September and January in most of the U.S., to coincide with the time of year when RSV infections tend to be most common.A baby born in April, for example, may not have much immunity left from the mother's vaccination by the time the fall RSV season comes around.“It really depends on when the due date is as to how impactful this vaccination will be,” said Dr. Grace Lee, chair of the CDC advisory panel.RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a common cause of coldlike symptoms. A surge last year filled hospitals with wheezing children, but far more U.S. seniors are hospitalized and die from the virus.Story continuesTwo new vaccines were recently approved for Americans age 60 and older. There isn't a vaccine for children.Some CDC panel members who ultimately supported the recommendation expressed reservations. Available data suggests the antibodies are a more cost-effective — and probably longer-lasting — way to prevent severe illness in infants.

In August, Pfizer's vaccine also won approval for the maternal use. Here's what you need to know.What is RSV?RSV is a usually seasonal respiratory virus that generally causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Still, infants and older adults have a higher risk of developing severe RSV.RSV leads to 58,000 to 80,000 hospitalizations among children under age 5, and 60,000 to 160,000 hospitalizations among adults age 65 and older each year, according to the CDC. It causes around 14,000 deaths in adults aged 65 and older in the U.S. annually, according to government estimates.Who should get the vaccines?The U.S. CDC has recommended that adults aged 60 or older may get the shot after discussions with a healthcare provider about whether RSV vaccination is right for them. The agency stopped short of saying all adults over the age of 60 should receive it this year.Outside advisers to the CDC suggested the narrower recommendation in June after expressing concern that there was not sufficient data on how effective the vaccines are in people over age 75 and in other high-risk groups.CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen formally recommended use of the vaccine in expecting mothers to protect infants up to age 6 months after the agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 11-1 in its favor. The panel recommended use of the shot in women 32 weeks to 36 weeks into their pregnancy from September to January, in order to protect babies born in peak RSV season.Story continuesHow often do I need to get the vaccine to stay protected?Early data suggests that the RSV shots are protective for at least two years, but it is not yet clear how often older adults will need to be revaccinated. CDC advisers will consider the frequency of revaccination when more data becomes available.What else is available to protect infants from RSV?In July, the FDA also approved Beyfortus, a long-acting antibody therapy from Sanofi and partner AstraZeneca , to prevent RSV in children up to 24 months of age.Previously, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum's Synagis was the only approved preventive therapy in the U.S. for high-risk infants. Synagis is given as monthly injections, while Beyfortus can be given annually.Are RSV cases on the rise?Yes, although not alarmingly so. Detection of the virus in testing has increased significantly over the last month to around the same levels as this spring, according to CDC data. Still, that is a fraction of the positive tests recorded at the same time a year ago, when RSV cases were surging around the country and hospitals were running out of pediatric beds.Can I get the RSV shot alongside my COVID and flu shots?Yes, current CDC guidelines allow for all three vaccines to be administered simultaneously, even though they have not been tested together.""If it's now or never again, it's best to get all the vaccines you're eligible for to get the protection against as many diseases as possible,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, a member of the board of directors for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. ""If you've got the luxury of returning for more than one visit, you can choose to space them out.""Will my insurance cover it?Adults who are insured under the U.S. Medicare program for people aged 65 and older or disabled are covered for the vaccine. Many private insurance plans, including large insurers like CVS Health's Aetna, Humana and Elevance , which owns Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers including Anthem, also say they are covering the shot for adults 60 and older who are not yet eligible for Medicare.

(NYSE: PFE) shared today it has broadened its portfolio of respiratory vaccines recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) following a favorable vote for ABRYSVO™ [Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine], the company’s bivalent RSV prefusion F (RSVpreF) vaccine, as a maternal immunization. This is the first-ever fall in which eligible individuals can receive Pfizer vaccines to help protect against RSV, COVID-19, and pneumococcal pneumonia.""This fall marks the start of the annual respiratory infection season in the Northern Hemisphere, and we are prepared with vaccines against multiple infectious diseases and -- for the first time in history -- an available RSV vaccine to help prevent disease in two at-risk populations,"" said Luis Jodar, PhD, Chief Medical Affairs Officer, Vaccines/Antivirals and Evidence Generation, Pfizer. ""Today’s ACIP recommendation for maternal immunization with ABRYSVO reinforces the wide-ranging impact vaccines can have, including helping protect infants immediately at birth from the potentially severe and life-threatening complications that can develop from RSV. Approximately 75 percent of RSV-related hospitalizations in newborns and infants occur in the first six months of life.""Today, ACIP recommended:Maternal RSV vaccine for pregnant people during 32 through 36 weeks gestation, using seasonal administration, to prevent RSV lower respiratory tract infection in infantsStory continuesThis provisional recommendation will be official once it is reviewed and adopted by the director of the CDC. The ACIP recommendation follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval of ABRYSVO in August as the first and only maternal vaccine for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) and severe LRTD caused by RSV in infants from birth up to six months of age by active immunization of pregnant individuals at 32 through 36 weeks gestational age.The action today by ACIP comes on the heels of recent and previous recommendations from the CDC.After FDA authorization and approval of our Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine 2023-2024 Formula earlier this month, ACIP recommended everyone 6 months and older get an updated COVID-19 vaccine to protect against COVID-19 illness this fall and winter.ABRYSVO is currently available and recommended using shared clinical decision making for adults 60 years of age and older to help protect against RSV disease. With more than 77 million individuals aged 60 and older in the U.S.1, the recommended use of this vaccine can help prevent the potentially serious consequences associated with RSV, which leads to the hospitalization of more than 60,000 of these adults each year.2PREVNAR 20® has been recommended by the CDC since October 2021 to help prevent pneumococcal disease among adults aged 65 years or older and adults 19-64 years old with certain medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes or other risk factors. Pneumococcal pneumonia results in more than 180,000 adult hospital admissions and more than 150,000 adult outpatient visits in the U.S. each year.3About ABRYSVOPfizer currently is the only company with an RSV vaccine to help protect older adults, as well as infants through maternal immunization. In May 2023, the FDA approved ABRYSVO for the prevention of LRTD caused by RSV in individuals 60 years of age or older. This was followed by the ACIP’s official recommendation of the vaccine for use in adults 60 years of age and older, which occurred in June 2023.In August 2023, Pfizer announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted marketing authorization for ABRYSVO for both older adults and maternal immunization to help protect infants. In February 2023, Pfizer Japan announced an application was filed with the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for RSVpreF as a maternal immunization to help protect infants against RSV. In April 2023, Pfizer Canada announced Health Canada accepted RSVpreF for review for both individuals ages 60 and older and as a maternal immunization to help protect infants against RSV.Pfizer has also initiated two additional clinical trials evaluating ABRYSVO. One trial is being conducted in children ages two to less than 18 years who are at higher risk for RSV disease. 4 A second trial is evaluating adults ages 18 to 60 years at higher risk for RSV due to underlying medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes and COPD, and adults ages 18 and older who are immunocompromised and at high risk for RSV.8 Pfizer also plans post-marketing studies and surveillance programs to further describe the safety of ABRYSVO.INDICATIONS FOR ABRYSVOABRYSVOTM is a vaccine indicated for:the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in people 60 years of age and olderpregnant individuals at 32 through 36 weeks gestational age for the prevention of LRTD and severe LRTD caused by RSV in infants from birth through 6 months of ageIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR ABRYSVOABRYSVO should not be given to anyone with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any of its componentsFor pregnant individuals: to avoid the potential risk of preterm birth, ABRYSVO should be given during 32 through 36 weeks gestational ageFainting can happen after getting injectable vaccines, including ABRYSVO.

It is typically a seasonal illness, starting in autumn and peaking in the winter in most of the U.S., according to the CDC.Because RSV is a seasonal disease, ""year round administration could not benefit children born in April through September,"" panel member Dr. Sarah Long, professor of pediatrics at Drexel University College of Medicine said.Story continuesIf needed, those babies could receive Sanofi and AstraZeneca's antibody therapy nirsevimab to prevent RSV in infants and toddlers, which was approved earlier this year, she said.An estimated 58,000 to 80,000 children below the age of five years are hospitalized each year due to RSV infection in the U.S., according to government data.Pfizer's vaccine, along with another made by GSK, won U.S. approval in May for use in people age 60 and older and are already available around the country.Pfizer said the list price of the maternal shot will be $295 per dose, the same as for older adults. It plans to use a tiered pricing strategy for the shot outside of the U.S.At an advisory meeting in May, FDA staffers had flagged a higher number of pre-term births among participants taking Pfizer's vaccine in a clinical trial compared to those who received a placebo. However, the agency said the difference did not appear to be statistically significant, thus might have been due to chance.A surge in cases of RSV infections coinciding with an increase in COVID transmission and an earlier-than-normal flu season has raised the specter of a so-called 'tripledemic' of respiratory illness across the United States.CDC has said it expects total hospitalizations from the three to be similar to last year.For the first time, vaccines to protect against all three diseases will be available this autumn, the government health agency said.(Reporting by Sriparna Roy and Mariam Sunny in Bengaluru; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

Assuming, of course, that his moment has actually arrived.On Thursday, his father Rupert Murdoch announced that in November he'll step down as the head of his two media companies: News Corp. and Fox Corp. Lachlan will become the chair of News Corp. while remaining chief executive and chair at Fox Corp., the parent of Fox News Channel.The changes make Rupert's eldest son the undisputed leader of the media empire his father built over decades. There's no real sign that his siblings and former rivals James and Elisabeth contested him for the top job; James in particular has distanced himself from the company and his father's politics for several years. But Rupert, now 92, has long had a penchant for building up his oldest children only to later undermine them — and sometimes to set them against one another — often flipping the table without notice.Given Rupert Murdoch's advanced age, this might be his last power move. But there's a reason the HBO drama “ Succession ” was often interpreted as a thinly disguised and dark satire of his family business. In Murdoch World, as in the fictional world of the Roy family, seemingly sure things can go sideways in an instant, particularly when unexpected opportunities arise.Lachlan Murdoch has lived that first hand. Born in London, he grew up in New York City and attended Princeton, where he focused not on business, but philosophy. His bachelor's thesis, titled “A Study of Freedom and Morality in Kant's Practical Philosophy,” addressed those weighty topics alongside passages of Hindu scripture. The thesis closed on a line from the Bhagavad Gita referencing “the infinite spirit” and “the pure calm of infinity,” according to a 2019 article in The Intercept.Béatrice Longuenesse, Lachlan's thesis advisor at Princeton, confirmed the accuracy of that report via email.After graduation, though, Lachlan plunged headlong into his father's business, moving to Australia to work for the Murdoch newspapers that were once the core of News Corp.'s business. Many assumed he was being groomed for higher things at News Corp., and they were not wrong. Within just a few years, Lachlan was deputy CEO of the News Corp. holding company for its Australian properties; shortly thereafter, he took an executive position at News Corp. itself and was soon running the company's television stations and print publishing operations.Story continuesLachlan's ascent came to an abrupt halt in 2005, when he resigned from News Corp. with no public explanation. According to Paddy Manning, an Australian journalist who last year published a biography of Lachlan Murdoch, the core problem involved two relatively minor issues on which Lachlan disagreed with Roger Ailes, who then ran Fox News.“The real point was that Lachlan felt Rupert had backed his executives over his son,” Manning said in an interview. “So Lachlan felt, 'If I'm not going to be supported, then what's the point?'” Manning did not have direct access to Lachlan for his book “The Successor,” but said he spoke in depth with the people closest to his subject.Lachlan returned to Australia, where he has often described feeling most at home, and founded an investment group that purchased a string of local radio stations among other properties.While he was away, News Corp. entered choppy waters. The U.K. phone-hacking scandal, in which tabloid journalists at the News of the World and other Murdoch-owned publications had found a way to listen to voicemails of the British royal family, journalistic competitors and even a missing schoolgirl, had seriously damaged the company. The fracas led to resignations of several News Corp. officials, criminal charges against some, and the closure of News of the World as its finances went south.Manning said that the damage the scandal inflicted on News Corp. — and on both Lachlan Murdoch's father and his brother James, chief executive of News' British newspaper group at the time — helped pull Lachlan back to the company.“He was watching the family tear itself apart over the phone-hacking scandal,” Manning said. Lachlan was “instrumental in trying to circle the wagons and turn the guns outwards, and stop Rupert from sacking James.”While it took more convincing, Lachlan eventually returned to the company in 2014 as co-chairman of News Corp. alongside James.Not long afterward, Ailes was forced out of his job at Fox News following numerous credible allegations of sexual harassment.Lachlan Murdoch has drawn criticism from media watchdogs for what many called Fox News' increasingly conspiratorial and misinformation-promoting broadcasts. The network hit a nadir following the 2020 election when voting machine company Dominion Voting Systems sued Fox News for $1.6 billion, alleging that Fox knowingly promoted false conspiracy theories about the security of its voting machines.Fox settled that suit for $787.5 million in March of this year. A similar lawsuit filed by Smartmatic, another voting-machine maker, may go to trial in 2025, Fox has suggested.In certain respects, though, Lachlan Murdoch's behavior suggests some ambivalence about his role at News Corp. In 2021 he moved back to Sydney and has been mixing commuting and remote work from Australia ever since. “I think there’s a legitimate question about whether you can continue to do that and for how long” while running companies based in the U.S., Manning said.___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives funding from the Quadrivium foundation, founded by James and Kathryn Murdoch.

163,a9aec124-af72-3bde-b407-a2d348d12775,FOXA,2023-09-23,Rupert Murdoch isn’t going anywhere just yet,The Economist,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rupert-murdoch-isn-t-going-194454524.html,1695411894,STORY,"['FOXA', 'DIS']","[“TO WALK AWAY and retire, it’s a pretty dismal prospect,” Rupert Murdoch told an interviewer in 1998, when he was already well into pensionable age. If he ever did stop working, he added, he would “die pretty quickly”.So the announcement on September 21st that the 92-year-old is stepping down as chairman of Fox Corporation and News Corp, the television and newspaper empires he has built up over more than 70 years, should be treated with some scepticism. Mr Murdoch will stay on as “chairman emeritus” and says he will remain “involved every day in the contest of ideas”. This week he advised staff: “When I visit your countries and companies, you can expect to see me in the office late on a Friday.” It was both a promise and a warning.The handover of Mr Murdoch’s empire has been a gradual process. He has shied away from earnings calls since the sale of 21st Century Fox, the bulk of his film and TV assets, to Disney in 2019. The question of succession was in effect settled the following year, when James Murdoch, the younger son and sometime heir apparent, left the News Corp board, citing “disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions”. This left the path clear for Mr Murdoch’s elder son, Lachlan, who will take over from his father at the two family firms.Why the change in titles now? Mr Murdoch said in his letter to staff this week that he was in robust health. But investors have recently begun to question those assurances. Vanity Fair reported in April that he had quietly suffered a series of health problems including a broken back, seizures and two bouts of pneumonia. His testimony in a recent legal case against Fox brought by Dominion Voting Systems, which accused the company of damaging its reputation, seemed to lack some of the mogul’s old sharpness.These concerns have coincided with a series of missteps. Fox pursued a calamitous legal strategy in the Dominion case, eventually paying up nearly $800m to settle it. (A related case brought by another voting-technology company, Smartmatic, is expected to go to trial in 2025; Smartmatic is seeking $2.7bn.) It has suffered public spats with some of its anchors, including Tucker Carlson, who was jettisoned in April and has since set himself up on the social network formerly known as Twitter. And an attempt by Mr Murdoch to unify his two companies earlier this year was shot down by shareholders.Story continuesThose investors may be reassured by Mr Murdoch’s more modest new title. In recent years analysts have come to speak of a “Murdoch discount” applied to Fox and News Corp. Mr Murdoch’s new title means that “his interface with the public markets is over,” says Claire Enders, a media analyst. “But it is obvious that he is the ultimate decision-maker as long as he is alive.”That is reflected nowhere so clearly as his choice of successor. Mr Murdoch set up a decades-long audition between three of his children: Elisabeth, Lachlan and James (his eldest child, Prudence, has mostly stayed away from the company; his two youngest children by another marriage, Grace and Chloe, are still in their early 20s). Though it was James who set up the auction of 21st Century Fox, selling to Disney at the top of the market for $71bn, the job has gone to Lachlan, the child who gets on best with his father. Whereas James and Elisabeth have both criticised the political positions of their father’s companies, Lachlan appears to share the elder Murdoch’s politics. Any changes are likely to be minor: perhaps a little more focus on streaming (Tubi, Fox’s advertising-supported streamer, is performing well) and less on British news media (TalkTV, a recent venture there, has not been a big hit so far).When Murdoch père eventually dies, things may change more. Control of the family trust, which ultimately holds sway over both companies, will pass to the four eldest siblings. The newspaper and television industries are both going through a bumpy digital transition, opening up new possibilities. Assets such as Fox News could be changed, or sold off, when the next generation takes control. But it may be a while before that happens. Mr Murdoch’s mother lived to be 103. One person close to the family, asked what will happen when Mr Murdoch passes, reports simply: “He insists he won’t.”© 2023 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

Born in London to Murdoch and his second wife, Anna, he grew up steeped in the media business. In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s “Dynasties” program, he said that every morning, before catching the school bus, he and his siblings would read the morning papers - The New York Post, The New York Times, the Daily News and the Wall Street Journal - with his father flagging stories of interest, ordering: “Read that.”The best way to capture their father’s attention in the evenings was to talk about media or politics, according to Paddy Manning’s 2022 biography, “The Successor.” As Lachlan Murdoch got older, he would spend summers working in the family business, cleaning the presses for Sydney’s “Daily Mirror,” or working as a cub reporter for the “San Antonio Express-News.”A rivalry between Lachlan and his younger brother, James, played out from an early age, where even family Monopoly games “were intense and everybody was prepared to cheat,” according to one published account.Lachlan Murdoch and his siblings attended Dalton, a private school on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, and other elite schools, including Trinity School, where he formed the Trinity Conservative Society, “In an attempt to create a healthy balance between all points of view,” according to one yearbook entry cited by Manning.Story continuesAfter graduating in 1994 from Princeton, where he majored in philosophy, he entered the family business, spending three years in Australia, ascending the corporate ladder to become chairman of News Limited.In 1999, Lachlan Murdoch assumed responsibility for print operations in the U.S. He rose to deputy chief operating officer at News Corp, overseeing the company’s U.S. television stations group and publishing assets, including the New York Post. Many saw him as being trained to assume the corporate reins as his father’s successor.He abruptly resigned in 2005, creating questions about who would succeed Rupert Murdoch at the helm of the media empire he had assembled from a single newspaper in Australia. Lachlan Murdoch founded Illyria Pty, a private investment company, whose acquisitions included a network of Australian radio stations. In 2015, he returned to the family business, sharing the title of co-chairman of 21st Century Fox with his brother, James.The sale of Fox’s entertainment assets to Walt Disney in 2019, in a $71-billion transaction, shrank the size of the Murdochs’ once-vast media holdings. The newly constituted Fox was reduced to a handful of assets, including the Fox broadcast network, Fox News, Fox Sports and Fox Business, with Lachlan Murdoch serving as its executive chair and chief executive officer.Brother James Murdoch left Fox with the close of the Disney transaction.As chief executive of Fox Corp since 2019, Lachlan Murdoch has presided over the media properties during seismic change in the industry, as viewers cut their cable subscriptions in favor of streaming services. Even so, Fox News has largely maintained its rating dominance, in part because of its appeal among politically conservative-leaning American viewers.Lachlan Murdoch doesn’t speak publicly about his politics, according to an article in the New York Times magazine, which cited the 2016 memoir ""Making Headlines,"" by Chris Mitchell, the longtime editor of The Australian, as describing “Lachlan’s conservatism is more vigorous than that of any Australian politician” and that his views were usually to the right of his father’s.A Fox spokesperson called that ""just speculation,"" adding ""I wouldn't want to put a label on him, but it wouldn't be unfair to categorize him as a conservative.""Fox’s loyalty to those viewers became a hot-button issue during discovery for Dominion Voting Systems’ lawsuit against Fox, in which the voting technology firm claimed that Fox perpetuated falsehoods about its voting machines in an effort to appease the network’s base of supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump. Fox settled the lawsuit for $787.5 million in April, avoiding a trial in which Lachlan and his father were expected to testify.In public remarks in the weeks following the settlement, Lachlan said that Fox had been acting as a news organization reporting on the newsworthy events of the day, and recommitted to Fox’s programming strategy.While Rupert Murdoch built his legacy pursuing the television, movie and newspaper businesses with equal abandon, Lachlan’s legacy is still taking shape. In calls with investors, he often becomes animated when speaking about Tubi, an ad-supported streaming service that the company acquired for $440 million in 2020, and which is now valued at $3 billion.Lachlan Murdoch's family lives in Sydney, Australia, and he travels to Los Angeles, where Fox is based and they also maintain a home.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles and Helen Coster in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Nick Zieminski)]"

Here’s a look into the real-life succession drama that roiled his family and inspired a hit HBO show,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rupert-murdoch-retiring-look-real-174113370.html,1695404473,STORY,"['NWSA', 'FOXA', 'DIS']","[Spoiler alert: The withering patriarch of Succession, Logan Roy, never stepped down as CEO of a media conglomerate before passing away, nor did he nail down a succession plan. But the real-life Logan Roy just did. Business magnate and media mogul Rupert Murdoch, 92, announced on Thursday that he’s retiring as chairman at Fox Corporation and News Corp. in mid-November after a seven-decade career.Despite the HBO drama creator Jesse Armstrong’s reminders that the characters are fictional and “no one family unlocks” them, the Roys have an uncanny resemblance to the Murdochs—a powerful, aging media executive who watches his children vie for control of the empire. Sound familiar? The similarities are apparent enough that Rupert Murdoch barred his ex-wife Jerry Hall from giving story ideas to Succession writers in their divorce settlement.Logan Roy, played by Brian Cox, is widely thought to be a composite of Murdoch and another media baron, the deceased Sumner Redstone, whose real-life story is even more dramatic than any HBO show, as captured in the recent book Unscripted (on which a new TV series may soon be based). But it’s the laundry list of similarities between Murdoch and the Waystar Royco CEO that makes them the closest analogues—from their foreign origins and numerous health scares, speeches atop printer paper podiums, multiple marriages and divorces, and, of course, pitting their children against each other while encouraging them to compete to be anointed as successor.The rivalry between Roman and Kendall Roy bears a striking resemblance to Lachlan and James Murdoch. Here’s a look at the Fox News succession—and who came out on top.Lachlan and JamesAlthough it’s been clear for a while, now it’s official: Murdoch said on Thursday that he’s handing the reins to his 52-year-old son Lachlan, who will become the sole chair of News Corp. and continue as executive chair and CEO of Fox Corporation.Lachlan, his older sister Elisabeth, and younger brother James have long been contenders for the top job. But Lachlan has seemingly always been Rupert’s “number-one boy” and the preferred choice to succeed him, Vanity Fair reported in May. Murdoch has suggested as much:Story continues""Currently it is their consensus that Lachlan will take over,"" Murdoch said in a 1997 interview, as reported by The Guardian. ""He will be the first among equals, but they will all have to prove themselves.""At first glance, Lachlan draws obvious comparisons to Kendall. Both are eldest sons who have been groomed to take over the family business one day. But in terms of personality, Lachlan more closely resembles Roman, the snarky, impulsive younger brother portrayed by Kieran Culkin.In 2005, Lachlan had a dispute with then-boss of Fox News, Roger Ailes—the same Ailes who was later sued by Fox host Gretchen Carlson for sexual harassment, which the movie Bombshell (featuring Margot Robbie and Nicole Kidman) was based. Lachlan quit his role as deputy COO of News Corp. and moved to Australia. He returned to the states nearly 10 years later at his father’s behest, agreeing to be his heir.But during Lachlan’s decade overseas, his younger brother, the now 50-year-old James, became the heir apparent. James spent those years climbing through the ranks, ensuring the longevity and respect of his father’s media empire by making deals with the likes of Hulu and National Geographic Channel and promising that News Corp. would go carbon neutral. His father bringing Lachlan back was like a “big slap in the face” to the younger brother, a source told Vanity Fair.James resembles Kendall in that he was known as “the smart one” and has been baited by his father for the top job for decades. James has served in high-ranking roles in News Corp. and even did a stint in Hong Kong, reminiscent of Kendall’s time in Shanghai. Jeremy Strong, the actor who portrays Kendall, told The New Yorker that he used details about James to prepare for the role.Disney and DominionIn August 2017, Murdoch and Disney CEO Bob Iger discussed selling 21st Century Fox’s assets to Disney. Lachlan and James clashed over the deal—Lachlan felt that his father and brother were rushing to sell his future empire out from underneath him, while James thought it was a good business opportunity, according to Vanity Fair. Not to mention, James was in talks with Iger to take a high-level position at Disney post-acquisition, the outlet reported.The deal went through. Disney acquired the 21st Century Fox movie and television studios for more than $52 billion in March 2019. Lachlan was left to run what remained—Fox News and the remaining assets—and James took his money and left to start a media fund called Lupa Systems. (The word lupa is Italian for “she-wolf,” like the one that raised the founding brothers of Rome—Romulus and Remus—before Romulus murdered Remus, Vanity Fair noted.)Then Fox News got involved with Trump. In 2020, Murdoch’s right-wing news network became the town crier of theories that the presidential election was stolen, asserting that voting machines owned by Dominion Voting Systems switched Americans’ votes to Biden after they’d voted for Trump. In response, Dominion brought a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit in March 2021 against Fox News, claiming that Murdoch protected Fox’s ratings by allowing hosts and guests to perpetuate the conspiracy. Two years later, Fox agreed to pay Dominion a $787 million settlement, and Fox host Tucker Carlson was fired.Elisabeth and PrudenceThe Succession inspirations go beyond Lachlan and James. Elisabeth is comparable to Siobhan (better known as Shiv), the sharp and poised daughter who originally pursued a career outside of her father’s empire and could run the company just as well if only she weren’t a woman in an ultra-conservative, male-dominated industry. Meanwhile, Prudence Murdoch resembles Connor Roy as she is the only child from the patriarch’s first marriage and is often considered the forgotten sibling.Lachlan and James don’t talk anymore. James has distanced himself from Fox News for its climate denialism, white nationalism, and election conspiracies. And now that Lachlan holds the keys to the kingdom, James is biding his time to oust his brother with the help of their sisters, Elisabeth and Prudence, once their father is gone, sources told Vanity Fair.People close to the Murdochs weren’t sure what James would do with Fox if he managed to win it back, but they assumed that he’d completely overhaul the organization or sell it off to the highest bidder.“James sees destroying Fox News as his mission in life,” a senior Fox staffer told Vanity Fair.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

However, their outlooks are not dismal by any means and show fears of slowing growth are overdone.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUndervalued EPS GrowthAs inflationary concerns began to ease at the beginning of the year the earnings outlook among the broader Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector increased significantly. While you would think PayPal and Block are towards the bottom of the pack considering their stock performances, their EPS outlooks show this is not the case.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPayPal’s growth is much slower than in the past but using the reference chart above we can see the company's anticipation of 20% EPS growth in fiscal 2023 (Chart below) is still superior to the Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector's 10.72% growth rate.Furthermore, PayPal’s earnings are projected to rise another 13% in FY24 which is on par with the historical EPS growth rate of the Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBlock's earnings projections are very compelling with 69% EPS growth this year and 36% growth next year hard to overlook and well above the sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMore Reasonable ValuationsHigh valuation concerns especially as it relates to price to earnings have been the knock-on Block’s stock more so than PayPal. With that being said, PayPal and Block’s P/E valuations are much more reasonable relative to their past.Starting with Block, SQ shares now trade at 27X forward earnings compared to extreme historical highs when the company became profitable and a median of 259.6X. Block’s price to sales of 1.3X is attractive as well and this metric is a better way to gauge the company’s valuation until it has a longer history of profitability.Story continuesIntriguingly, Block’s P/S ratio has become very reaonable and is nicely below the optimum level of less than 2X and a noticeable discount to the S&amp;P 500’s 3.9X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs for PayPal, its forward earnings multiple of 11.8X is 86% below the five-year high of 87.8X for PYPL and a 74% discount to the median of 45.7X. In terms of price to sales, PayPal’s P/S of 2.2X is closing in on the optimum level and attractively beneath the benchmark.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line While the market has continued to drag PayPal and Block’s stock they are certainly making the case for being undervalued considering their above-average EPS growth. For now, these fintech players both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as the risk to reward opportunity is very favorable despite their yearly declines.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with PYPL. Click here to check it out. PYPL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PYPLAs of 2023-09-22, PayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL)'s intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $111.56. It's currently trading at a price of $58.82. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 47.28%. The company is significantly undervalued.The Art of Valuation: Discovering Intrinsic Value of PayPal Holdings IncThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. PayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL)'s intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$3.57GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.44%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 20.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=57.95Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=58.2Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=111.56Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $85.08. This valuation indicates that the PayPal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ:PYPL) is significantly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 30.87%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Are stocks in a secular bull or a secular bear in 2023?What is a Secular Bull and Bear Market? First thing investors should know is what is a secular bull or bear market. The stock market can have two kinds of markets, secular and cyclical. Cyclical bull and bears are the short-term trade. In 2022, stocks were in a cyclical bear market as they sold off. Secular bulls are longer term, and can last years. The 1982-2000 secular bull lasted 18 years.Secular bear markets are marked by the lack of new all-time highs on the S&amp;P 500 and a treading water type of momentum, where stocks don’t seem to ever want to break out. And if they DO hit new highs, they give it up and sink again. This was the scenario in the 2001-2012 secular bear.Can These 5 Stocks Tell us if Stocks are in a Secular Bull or Bear Market? 1.      Shopify Inc. (SHOP)Shopify was one of the big winner stocks during the pandemic, hitting a new all-time high in 2021. But Shopify sold off in 2022, along with many growth stocks.But the shares rallied in 2023, gaining 54.6%. Many thought the worst was over. However, Shopify still remains down 62% over the last 2 years. It’s not really cheaper either, on a P/E basis. It still trades at 168x.Story continuesIs Shopify’s big sell-off, and a lack of a return to the highs, a sign that stocks are now in a secular bear market?2.      PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL)PayPal was one of the big winners of the pandemic as the fintech companies were in demand. Shares peaked in 2021 and have been on the slide ever since.Shares of PayPal have fallen 17.7% year-to-date, missing out on the growth stock rally. Over the last 2 years, they are down 78.9%. And they have even round tripped over the last 5 years and are now down 35% during that time.PayPal shares are now cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of just 12.3.Is the collapse of PayPal shares a sign that stocks are in a secular bear market?3.      Apple Inc. (AAPL)Apple has been one of the stalwarts of the secular bull market which began in 2013. It was originally part of FAANG, then in FANGMAN and now it is a member of the Magnificent 7.Apple has joined in on the 2023 rally, gaining 34% year-to-date. Over the last 2 years, it’s also still in the green, up 18.4%. Apple even hit another all-time high in 2023.Apple, however, isn’t a cheap stock on a P/E basis. It trades at 29x.But with Apple, one of the big winners of the secular bull, still breaking out, is it a sign that stocks are still in the secular bull market?4.      NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)NVIDIA is having quite the year. Shares are up 180.7% year-to-date with earnings expected to jump 219.5%. Shares of NVIDIA originally hit new highs in 2021, along with the other FANGMAN and growth stocks. And although they sold off in 2022, they bounced back quickly and have been hitting new highs again in 2023.Over the last 2 years NVIDIA is up 85% and over the last 5, it has gained 520%. NVIDIA now trades with a forward P/E of 39.6.In secular bears, the prior winners do not lead yet NVIDIA is still leading.Is NVIDIA signaling that stocks are still in the secular bull?5.      Baker Hughes Co.

Shares of Baker Hughes are up just 9.9% over the last 5 years.But, after bottoming in 2020, the energy stocks like Baker Hughes have been on the move higher.

In its September FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate unchanged at the existing 5.25-5.5%, as stated on Sep 20. However, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell dampened market participants’ sentiments.Although the Fed paused its rate hike in the September FOMC meeting, the current dot-plot has shown a strong likelihood of one more hike of 25 basis points in 2023. That will take the terminal interest rate of this hiking cycle to 5.6%, well above the 5.1% forecast in June. Notably, the current range of the Fed fund rate is the highest level since March 2001.More importantly, the central bank said it would keep interest rates higher for a longer time period. The new projection has shown two maximum rate cuts in 2024 instead of four projected in June. The first cut in interest rate is not expected before September 2024.As a result, the yield on the short-term 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note reached 5.202%, its highest level since 2006. This link is closely linked to the possibility of a near-term economic downturn. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note touched 4.494%, its highest level since 2007.A higher market interest rate is detrimental to high-growth sectors like technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrency. Notably, the crypto space suffered a huge blow last year as the Fed pursued a rigorous interest rate hike regime.Consequently, on Sep 21, prices of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB) slid 1.7%, 1.9%, 1.9%, 2.3% and 1.6%, respectively.Stocks in FocusRobinhood Markets Inc.

(NYSE:IBM), has expressed concerns about the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. On Friday in an interview on Bloomberg Radio, Cohn criticized the central bank's strategy of increasing interest rates to counter inflation, arguing it might be causing more harm than good.Cohn attributed this year's series of bank failures to the heightened interest rates, which he says have depreciated the value of long-term assets and prompted deposit withdrawals. He fears that these events will push the Federal Reserve to raise capital requirements for America's largest banks, a measure whose efficacy he questions.Despite the Federal Reserve's recent decision to maintain the federal funds rate between 5.25% to 5.5%, Jerome Powell, chair of the central bank, has indicated a potential rate hike later this year. Cohn expressed concerns over this unprecedented situation where the Federal Reserve is tightening monetary policy to curb inflation while the federal government is simultaneously boosting spending.He pointed out that government initiatives like the Chips Act and infrastructure programs will continue to stimulate labor market demand, even as higher interest rates put pressure on the housing market. In an ideal scenario, were Cohn given an opportunity to converse with Powell, he would advise him that enough measures have already been taken by the Federal Reserve.Cohn's critique of the current monetary policy underscores a significant concern about its impact on regional banks and its potential effect on broader financial stability. His comments highlight a debate about how best to manage interest rates in a complex and changing economic landscape.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Service Employees International Union President Mary Kay Henry says workers are saying ""enough is enough. You're doing better as a company, I need to do better as a working person in this country."" When asked if labor unions are being more active now because the labor market is so tight, Henry says it's a different conversation.

But as you know, Mary, there are strikes going on across so many different kinds of companies and industries and sectors, so autoworkers but also airline pilots, UPS workers, Hollywood actors and writers. I know that's a lot of different sectors and industries and markets, Mary. But do you think there's any kind of unifying theme there that's some explanation of why we see this rise of organizing activity?MARY KAY HENRY: Absolutely. Companies are generating record profits. And they need to be invested in the workers that carried us through the pandemic, that are moving through extreme heat and continuing to make our airports run, as the service workers who do baggage handling and cabin cleaning do every day in our nation's airports.Starbucks workers are trying to organize and join a union because that's a very profitable company that needs to create a seat at the table and a voice on the job for those workers. And so I think the common thread between all these workers is enough is enough. You're doing better as a company. I need to be able to do better as a working person in this country and work hard for a living in one job where I can expect that my children are going to do better than I've done.Story continues- And Mary, would another reason though, also be that union leaders are looking at the labor market, and they see a sturdy labor market, low unemployment, sub-4%, and they think now is the time to strike because now they have leverage?MARY KAY HENRY: I actually think the conversation is different because working people have to take a huge economic risk to decide to go on strike, whether it's a tight labor market or a loose labor market. And I think what's happening across the economy is workers are taking inspiration from each other.Autoworkers got to see UPS workers threaten a strike and have a history-making contract. Hollywood and SAG-AFTRA workers are on strike, demanding more from Hollywood. And then the UAW workers join them. We have Kaiser Permanente workers who just set October 3 and 4 for their strike date from a major health care company along the West Coast. So workers understand that they deserve better.

But when you consider all the concessions that they made, that the workers had to make to bail out some of these big three during the 2007 and 2008 financial crisis, plus COVID, plus current inflation, when you add all that together then, it does make it seem like the demands aren't that unreasonable. So what should people understand about that context, and some of the demands that they're now asking for?JASMIN BARMORE: The demands are really not that unreasonable. Because if you look at what they're asking for, they're asking for like $40 an hour, which equates to about $1,600 a week. And that's before taxes. So when you look at what their actual bring home pay after taxes are going to be taken out of it, health insurance, retirement benefits, all of that stuff, they're not bringing home $1,700.And the average rent right now in Detroit is about $1,000 a month. And we're not talking about energy prices, and don't run into an emergency, and you've got to go to the hospital, or have a family problem, or something like that.One of the workers that I spoke to, he said to me that people are saying that the UAW workers are just selfish. And they're greedy. And he's like, how are we being greedy, when our CEOs are making millions of dollars? The profit shares have been out of the roof, and they have not been giving us our fair share for how long now.Story continuesSo I think we need to understand that at this day and time, we have just come out of a natural circumstances with the pandemic. And the economy is inflated. Higher than it's ever been in the last 40 years.So wages across the board, some would say, need to be increased. But you've got to look at the working class individuals. Someone who is living paycheck to paycheck. They're tired. They're tired of living like that. People want to be able to go to the grocery store and buy the groceries that they want to have in their household to feed them and their family.People want to be able to put gas in their car so that they can go and take a road trip, if they want to. They're tired of how they've been living. And they're ready for change.]"

Also, strategic acquisitions are expected to strengthen the bank’s operations. However, expectations of a decline in the net interest income (NII) on higher funding costs and a lack of diversification in the loan portfolio are concerning.The bank’s total loans and deposits witnessed a four-year (2018-2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.6% and 13%, respectively. The uptrend continued sequentially in the first half of 2023 in terms of loans, while deposits declined. Given the company’s well-diversified loan base, its solid loan balances are likely to offer support. Our model estimates total loans and deposit balances to rise, seeing a CAGR of 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively, over the next three years.PNC Financial remains committed to strengthening its business through strategic initiatives. In 2022, the company closed the buyout of Linga, a point of sale (POS) and payment solutions firm, in a bid to expand corporate payment capabilities in the hospitality and restaurant industry space.In 2021, the company completed the conversion of BBVA USA customers and employees to PNC Financial's network and platforms. Thus, its bottom line is likely to get further support if it continues to make planned investments and diversify its business mix.PNC Financial continues to progress with its capital distribution strategy. The company has a 100-million repurchase plan in place that was authorized in second-quarter 2022. Of this, nearly 46% was available for repurchase as of Jun 30, 2023. Given the likelihood of stringent regulatory capital requirements post the 2023 stress test, PNC is expected to undertake modest share repurchase activity in the third quarter of 2023.Nonetheless, in July 2023, the company sequentially hiked the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock by 3.3% to $1.55 per share. Also, the company’s available cash and due from banks balance at the second-quarter 2023 end was $6.19 billion, whereas its times interest earned ratio was 4. Hence, with ample cash balances and earnings strength, its capital deployment activities seem sustainable.Story continuesHowever, PNC’s non-interest expenses witnessed a four-year CAGR (2018-2022) of 6.3%. The rising trend continued in the first half of 2023. Though the company aims at cost-containment measures (cost reduction target of $450 million in 2023 through the continuous improvement program), a rising expense base is likely to continue affecting the bottom line in the near term. We estimate the metric to reach $13.48 billion in the current year.Going forward, higher funding costs are expected to weigh on PNC Financials’ NII. Particularly, the hike in interest rates that supported NII growth is not expected to continue. Such a decline in NII might impede the company’s top-line growth. Accordingly, management expects the metric to decline 3-4% sequentially in the third quarter of 2023. Though we anticipate the metric to rise 5.5% in the current year, it will decline 3.9% in 2024.The majority of PNC Financial’s loan portfolio, around 68% of the total loans as of Jun 30, 2023, comprises total commercial loans. The current rapidly changing macroeconomic backdrop may put some strain on commercial lending. Thus, the lack of loan portfolio diversification is likely to hurt the company’s financials if the economic situation worsens.In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 1% against the industry's 2.7% rise.Finance Stocks Worth ConsideringA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance sector are First Business Financial Services FBIZ and Citizens Financial Services CZFS.First Business Financial’s current-year earnings estimates have been unrevised over the past 30 days.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for CSX CSX's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Shareholders will be happy to know that CSX's EPS has grown 18% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. CSX maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 7.8% to US$15b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for CSX's future EPS 100% free.Are CSX Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of CSX, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$175m. We note that this amounts to 0.3% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of CSX but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Story continuesIt's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like CSX, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m.CSX's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$9.4m in the year leading up to December 2022. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Should You Add CSX To Your Watchlist?For growth investors, CSX's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. If that's not enough, consider also that the CEO pay is quite reasonable, and insiders are well-invested alongside other shareholders. The overarching message here is that CSX has underlying strengths that make it worth a look at. It is worth noting though that we have found 1 warning sign for CSX that you need to take into consideration.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

189,413f2e1e-ecdb-38ce-b880-1de823fe49c9,CSX,2023-09-23,UAW strike: Why railroads could feel the impact too,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/uaw-strike-why-railroads-could-152101927.html,1695396061,VIDEO,"['F', 'CSX', 'NSC', 'GM', 'UNP', 'STLA']","[The autoworkers are continuing their strikes against the Big Three automakers, Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA). Most economists expect for there to be some ripple effects across the U.S. economy. One industry that could feel the impact is railroads. Cowen Senior Research Analyst Jason Seidl tells Yahoo Finance Live that ""autos have been one of the few brights spots"" for railroads in what has been an overall ""tough"" year for the industry. Seidl says he does expect the strikes to eventually start showing up in the railroad companies' numbers, though it's not being seen yet due to lags in the data.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: If the UAW strike becomes prolonged, the effects could span out to industries outside of autos. Joining us now with the impact we could see on rail, we've got Jason Seidl who is the Cowen senior research analyst. So just broad strokes, set the set the table for us here. What are some of those impacts that you're anticipating, based on any correlations that we could see overflow from the UAW strike right now?JASON SEIDL: Well, thanks for having me. So it's been a very tough year for the railroads. Volumes of have not been what everyone has hoped for. We're down about 4.5% on the year. And ironically, autos have been one of the few bright spots. We have double digit growth in automotive traffic for the railroads in 2023.So if you take that away, you're adding over a half a percentage point on the downward side, the total traffic for the rails. And so we are expecting this to eventually start hitting numbers. You're not seeing it yet, because there's a couple week lag in what you see in the numbers.The railroads already reported on a week lag, but there's also some finished vehicles on the ground that they can still move as we head into the strike here. But a prolonged strike, you're going to really get an impact for the railroads, and that's coming with a backdrop of just everything else putting pressure on them.Story continues- Yeah, certainly. And, Jason, as we're speaking right now, we're just getting the headline crossing that today at noon all parts distribution facilities here in for GM and Stellantis are being called to strike. When you take a look at where some of these locations will be, the strike for GM parts plants in Michigan, two locations there, strike of all US Stellantis part plants, that is according to sources here in terms of what we are seeing crossing Bloomberg right now. And Fein saying that GM, Stellantis still needs some, quote, ""serious pushing.""Now, they are continuing their strike against Ford, but they are not going to be expanding their strike with Ford. So, Jason, as we talk about some of the ripple effects and what you were just saying in terms of the lag effects that we could see for the rails, the longer that this goes on, how big of an impact could we see? If this is a strike that lasts, we're talking 30 days, potentially 45 days, which is what we just heard from our last guest.JASON SEIDL: We've already taken some of our numbers down yesterday to account for the slower-than-expected traffic that we've seen and maybe some minor impacts from the strike that we're seeing. Remember, total automotive exposure for the railroads is somewhere between 4% and 5%, depending upon the carrier, so it's not really large. But it's going to impact them, like I said, because you're already in an environment where the railroads have their own labor that are costs are going higher. Remember, when the railroad workers were about to strike, they got ordered back to work by Congress. But that was the most expensive rail labor contract in history, and the railroads have been around for a while. So you have that flowing through on the cost side.Additionally, on the cost side, you had some weather impacts here in the near term. And additionally, on the cost side, you're seeing fuel rise up. Fuel has dropped from January to July. But post the end of July, we've seen a big rise in fuel, and the rails get hit on that with about a 60-day lag on the recovery side. So near terms, the railroads have a lot of negative things going on, and unfortunately, very few positives these days.]"

PLNT will likely benefit from strategic partnerships and international expansion. Also, the emphasis on marketing and digitalization initiatives bodes well. However, an uncertain macroeconomic environment is a concern.Let us delve into the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for now.Growth DriversStrategic Efforts: PLNT has focused on strategic partnerships and global expansion to expand its presence. Its collaboration with iFit, a prominent provider of online home workouts, has introduced new equipment-free workouts exclusively on the Planet Fitness App, available to both members and non-members at no cost.Despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus crisis, PLNT has attracted interest from private-equity-backed franchise groups looking to invest in the brand.Marketing Initiatives: The company remains focused on strengthening its marketing efforts to drive growth. PLNT has shifted from working with 16 marketing agencies to partnering with a single agency, Publicis Groupe, to boost member growth. This agency will handle both creative work and media placement for the annual New Year's sale, aligning with the company's national and local advertising strategy. This transition is expected to reduce media costs while enhancing member acquisition efforts.For the second quarter of 2023, the company reported solid membership conversions on the back of its marketing and promotional offers. During the quarter, membership levels grew by more than 300,000 and came in at more than 18.4 million compared with 16.5 million in the previous-year quarter. For the rest of 2023, the company expects regularized joining trends and seasonality to continue.Digitalization to Drive Growth: PLNT focuses on engaging existing members through its mobile app, emphasizing increased downloads, usage, and added functionality like referral incentives, messaging, and notifications. Moreover, features such as upgrades from classic white card membership to the black card are an opportunity to drive the rate. The app's referral feature amplifies word-of-mouth marketing. The company also plans to use its large membership base of 17 million to enhance brand awareness.The company is witnessing strong traffic on its digital platform, driven by existing and new members, especially for iFit content. To capitalize on this, the company acquired a minority stake in iFIT Health &amp; Fitness in the first quarter of 2021. This move allows Planet Fitness to expand its digital content offerings, including mind and body wellness categories. Additionally, PLNT's United We Move workouts have received a positive response on Facebook worldwide.Story continuesConcernsZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of Planet Fitness have declined 20.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s 21% rise. Increased new store construction costs and interest rate expenses dented the company's performance. The inflation concerns remain a potent headwind. Chances of increase in materials, shipping, equipment and labor costs are likely to impact the company’s profitability in the upcoming period. The company has lowered its near-term store growth forecast due to the headwinds.PLNT heavily relies on franchisees that reduces costs but pose risks. An Economic slowdown may harm its royalty fees and equipment sales, impacting revenue. Relying on franchisees also risks the brand image if they take unfavorable actions. Also, the company’s business could be damaged in the event of any third-party misappropriation, dilution, infringement or other violation of intellectual property.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksPlanet Fitness currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are:Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

191,c10d3ecd-6ac2-3336-9616-e7b7125cd4c8,RCL,2023-09-23,Vista Outdoor (VSTO) Hits 52-Week High: What's Driving it?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vista-outdoor-vsto-hits-52-141800764.html,1695392280,STORY,"['VSTO', 'RCL', 'LYV']","[Vista Outdoor Inc. VSTO reached a new 52-week high of $32.18 on Sep 21. The stock pulled back to end of the trading session at $31.76, up 1.7% from the previous day’s closing price of $31.22.The company’s uptrend is attributable to its focus on restructuring and profit improvement initiatives for the Outdoor Products segment, reflecting solid segmental performance along with accretive acquisitions. Despite the lingering market challenges, it remains optimistic about its growth prospects in fiscal 2024 as well as long term through various strategic initiatives.Stock PerformanceThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock gained 28% in the past year compared with the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Products industry’s 11% growth, the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s increase of 12.4% and the S&amp;P 500 Index’s rise of 17.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings estimate for fiscal 2024 has moved up to $4.69 per share from $4.61 in the past 60 days. The positive trend signifies bullish sentiments of analysts, indicating robust fundamentals and sparking the expectation of an outperformance in the near term.What’s Making the Stock Attractive?Focus on Improvement Initiatives: To counter the negative impacts of macroeconomic uncertainties and organic decline, Vista Outdoor introduced a new restructuring and profit improvement initiative in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023. As part of the initiative, it launched a cost reduction and earnings improvement program of more than $50 million. This strategic action is intended on achieving meaningful margin improvement from fiscal 2024.The program’s implementation started showing its results from first-quarter fiscal 2024. During the quarter, the Outdoor Products segment witnessed a 473 basis points (bps) sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin. Also, corporate expenses were $8 million lower, sequentially.Considering the upward trend, VSTO now expects the segmental adjusted EBITDA margin to be above 10% in second quarter. The metric is projected in the range of 12-13% by fourth quarter.Outdoor Products Segment Boosting Growth: The company is quite optimistic about this segment’s performance outlook, given the diverse brands housed under its portfolio. There are 34 brands operating under this segment that contributed 4.7% to the consolidated sales value in first-quarter fiscal 2024. Segmental sales increased 8% year over year mainly driven by acquisitions. Also, segmental gross profit grew 3% year over year to $95 million in the quarter.Furthermore, Vista Outdoor’s decision to execute Planned Separation will result in a split of its two reportable segments, Outdoor Products and Sporting Products, into two independent, publicly traded companies. From the Outdoor Products segment’s perspective, VSTO believes that this spinoff will unlock shareholders’ value and highlight this segment’s position among its peers in the competitive market. The partition will enable it to realize the value earned from this segment which was otherwise not reflected in its results, thus accelerating growth prospects.Accretive Buyouts: Vista Outdoor indulges in making strategic profitable acquisitions to expand its product portfolio and market share. During second-quarter fiscal 2023 it made two portfolio-shifting acquisitions, which are included in its Outdoor Products segment.VSTO acquired Simms Fishing Products or Simms, a premium fishing brand and leading manufacturer of waders, outerwear, footwear and technical apparel. It also bought Fox Holdings, Inc. or Fox Racing, a leader in the motocross industry and a growing brand in the mountain bike category. The purchase price allocation for both these buyouts were finalized during fourth-quarter fiscal 2023.Story continuesOther Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks from the same sector are Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

192,99410d0a-0ebc-3383-be29-e86a540a68b8,RCL,2023-09-23,"Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Royal Caribbean Cruises, Live Nation Entertainment and OneSpaWorld",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-royal-125300142.html,1695387180,STORY,"['RCL', 'LYV', 'OSW', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 22, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. LYV and OneSpaWorld Holdings Ltd. OSW.Industry: Leisure &amp; RecreationLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2153527/3-leisure-recreation-services-stocks-to-buy-despite-industry-gloomThe Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry faces challenges due to elevated inflation and a sluggish global economy. However, the industry benefits from optimizing business processes, consistent strategic partnerships and digital initiatives. The robust demand for concerts, improving bookings for cruise operators and higher per capita spending at theme parks are supporting the industry. Industry players like Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. and OneSpaWorld Holdings Ltd. are likely to gain in their respective fields owing to the factors mentioned above.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry comprises various recreation providers, such as cruise, entertainment and media owners, golf-related leisure and entertainment venue businesses, theme park makers, resort operators and event organizers. Some industry players have ski and sports businesses, while some operate health and wellness centers onboard cruise ships and at destination resorts.Many companies are engaged in hospitality and related businesses. A few of the industry participants also provide weight management products and services. These companies primarily thrive on overall economic growth, which fuels consumer demand for products. Demand, highly dependent on business cycles, is driven by a healthy labor market, rising wages and a growing disposable income.3 Trends Shaping the Leisure &amp; Recreation Services Industry's FutureConcerns of Slowing Global Economy &amp; High Inflation: A slowdown in the global economy is likely to hurt the industry. Inflation in the United States is the biggest challenge for the economy. The consumer price index (CPI) reading for August inched up 0.6% on a monthly basis, higher than July's rise of 0.2%. Year over year, CPI increased 3.7% in August, higher than the expected rise of 3.6%. This is also the first time since February 2022 that CPI has increased more than 0.6% month over month. Inflationary cost increases in labor, compensation, healthcare, freight and rent lead to higher expenses.Story continuesRobust Demand Aid Cruise Operators: The cruise industry is benefiting from strong demand for cruising and accelerating booking volumes. The industry is benefiting from solid bookings concerning North America and European sailings. Also, strong pricing (on closer-in-demand) and solid onboard spending bode well for the industry. However, the cruise operators' operations are likely to be influenced by the uncertainty related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Geopolitical developments have pushed fuel curves higher. Due to the war, most cruise operators have decided to withdraw all activity in Russia.Theme Park Operators &amp; Live Entertainment Companies Bouncing Back: The theme park industry has been benefiting from robust demand. Theme park operators have been gaining from improving visitation. Consumer spending at theme parks continues to rise. Live entertainment firms have benefited from pent-up live event demand and robust ticket sales.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry is grouped within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #180, which places it in the bottom 27% of 246 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries results from a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in the group's earnings growth potential. Since Aug 31, 2023, the industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have dropped 0.9%.Before we present a few stocks that investors can consider, let's analyze the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Underperforms the S&amp;P 500The Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite, but has outperformed its sector in the past year. Stocks in the industry have collectively increased 16.5% in the past year compared with the broader sector's increase of 9.3%. The S&amp;P 500 has risen 17.7% in the said time frame.ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing debt-laden leisure service stocks, the industry trades at 54.43X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 19.71X and the sector's 13.09X. In the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 59.36X and as low as 6.20, with the median being 9.49X.3 Leisure and Recreation Services Stocks Worth Betting OnRoyal Caribbean Cruises: Based in Miami and incorporated in 1985, Royal Caribbean Cruises is a cruise company. The company benefits from the strong demand for Caribbean itineraries, solid close-in bookings at higher prices and the continued strength of onboard spend. Given the full fleet resumption and high-priced load factors, the company expects customer deposits to return to typical seasonality in the upcoming periods. In 2023, the company anticipates solid guest generation from the North America region.Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have surged 104.7% in the past year. In 2023, the company's sales and earnings are expected to witness growth of 55.1% and 182.1%, respectively, from the prior year's expected levels.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis on how US firms are elevating the retirement experience in the Philippines, go to 5 Best Places to Retire in the Philippines.US Firms Elevating Retirement Experience in the PhilippinesIn 2022, the Philippines' economy grew at a pace of 7.6%, the fastest economic growth that the country has recorded since 1976. Owing to a strong growth forecast in the medium term, the Philippines GDP in US Dollar nominal terms is poised to exceed the USD $1 trillion mark by 2033. Key drivers of growth for the economy include rapid boost in private consumption spending, improved remittance inflows, an upturn in government infrastructure spending, and a boom in urban household incomes.The country is also set to benefit from the recently implemented RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) trade deal, aimed at lowering trade barriers, improving market access, streamlining custom-related procedures, and gaining tariff concessions from trading partners. The deal will also help build manufacturing supply chains within the RCEP region across different countries.Owing to its reputation as one of the fastest developing countries in the world, the country promises enormous opportunities that can be tapped into. The next few years will witness the economy growing at a forecasted 4% or more annually despite the global slowdown. Being the second largest center for Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), it boasts a strong industrial sector and a richness of natural resources, and its booming economy is ultimately attracting individuals from all over the world.One demographic that has been increasingly interested in the country's economic prosperity is retirees. Having no significant savings of their own and hoping to retire to a country that promises financial ease and improved quality of life, many retirees are now turning towards this country to help fulfill their retirement dreams. As of 2022, more than 35,000 Americans have moved to the country, constituting approximately 1.3% of the US population residing in the Philippines. Considering its one of the easiest countries to get citizenship as an American, it is increasingly being seen as a way out of financial trouble in the retirement years.Story continuesThe US economy's interest and pledge to invest in the Philippines has been further reinstating retiree decisions regarding moving to the country. In an aggressive push to increase foreign investments, the government of the Philippines has enabled the ownership of 100% of ventures in certain critical industries, and a lot of countries from the US are interested.In fact, the country has managed to secure $1.3 billion worth of investment pledges from the US, aiming to directly generate over 6,700 employment opportunities. For instance, Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ:MAXN), a global leader in solar technology and innovation, has been eyeing an investment of $900 million in solar energy in the Philippines. Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ:MAXN) aims to bring its latest solar technology, Max7, to the Philippines.“With this project, the most advanced solar cells in the world will be manufactured in the Philippines,” notes Trade Secretary Alfredo Pascual.Investments in solar technology in the Philippines, such as those by Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ: MAXN), can help potential retirees reduce energy costs and decrease reliance on the local power grid. Similarly, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) and  Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) have also expressed their interest in investing in the country. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is an American multinational healthcare and insurance company that aims to invest P800 million ($14.125 million) to set up health information management services operations in Davao, generating 1,500 jobs.Meanwhile, Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) will set up a research and development center in the country, hiring an additional 1,000 engineers for semiconductors. The participation of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in the Philippines will undoubtedly improve the healthcare landscape in the region, a major draw for retirees. Similarly, firms such as Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) that are improving job opportunities and maintaining economic stability in the country can help provide retirees with a secure financial environment, assuring them of stable living costs and favorable exchange rates for their pensions or savings.Retiring to the PhilippinesPhilippines is one of the best countries to retire in Asia.

196,3cee5c43-bcc4-35ae-ae84-d9896590a83d,SBAC,2023-09-23,4 REITs to Consider as Economic Growth Projections Move North,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reits-consider-economic-growth-165400269.html,1695401640,STORY,"['SBAC', 'AVB', 'WELL']","[Are you fretting too much about your investments in the REITs because of the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to keep the benchmark interest rate steady at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.50% and indicating for keeping the rates high for a longer period? Then, it’s time to think again and focus on Welltower WELL, AvalonBay Communities AVB, SBA Communications Corporation SBAC and Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT.This is because although the Fed has indicated through its dot plots that there will be fewer rate cuts next year, its latest Summary of Economic Projections paints a brighter picture for economic growth and the labor market.Members have revised economic growth projections north, with the gross domestic product now expected to increase 2.1% this year, more than double June's 1% estimate, indicating that a recession is not expected in the immediate future. Further, the GDP projection for 2024 moved up to 1.5% from 1.1%.Also, the labor market is likely to exhibit resiliency than what was previously expected, with officials estimating the unemployment rate for the current year to be 3.8%, down from the prior projection of 4.1%. Further, the expected inflation rate, as measured by the core personal consumption expenditure price index, decreased to 3.7%, down by 0.2 percentage points from June.Now with economic activity “expanding at a solid pace”, as characterized by the committee, REITs stand to gain. This is because with the REIT sector offering the real estate structure for several economic activities, be it real or virtual, there are pockets of strength, even in a high-rate environment. REITs’ business usually buoys up on a stepped-up economy and a resilient job market because a fatter purse gives tenants more power to demand real estate space.What’s more encouraging is REITs’ characteristic of providing natural protection against inflation. Particularly, both rents and real estate values have a tendency to move north with prices increasing, thereby aiding dividend growth. The majority of leases are tied to inflation, which leads to rent increases as inflation goes up. Therefore, even during the inflationary period, investments in the REIT industry can offer a steady stream of income.Moreover, REITs are effectively managing challenges posed by stricter credit conditions and the persistent high-interest-rate environment with typical low-leverage policies and focusing on fixed-rate and unsecured debt. Solid balance sheets remain a major reason for investors to stay invested in REITs, even amid the capital and mortgage market’s turmoil in the current real estate investment environment.Per the data from Nareit’s Total REIT Industry Tracker Series (T-Tracker) for the second quarter of 2023, leverage ratios remained modest with debt-to-market assets below 35%, while the percentage of total debt at a fixed rate was 91%. Moreover, the percentage of the total debt that was unsecured was 79%, offering REITs a competitive edge.Story continuesStock PicksWelltower partners with top senior housing operators, post-acute care providers and health systems and invests in the real estate infrastructure, encompassing senior housing, post-acute care communities and outpatient medical facilities in key growth markets across the United States, Canada and the UK.Welltower is well-poised to benefit from its diversified portfolio of healthcare real estate assets. Given the continued strength of its senior housing operating portfolio, aided by favorable demographic trends, healthy demand-supply fundamentals, and robust and accretive capital deployment activity, the company recently amped up its current-year normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share guidance to $3.51-$3.60 from $3.48-$3.59. We expect the metric to exhibit year-over-year growth of 14.9% in 2023. Furthermore, WELL’s portfolio-restructuring efforts and solid balance sheet augur well.Welltower currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 FFO per share has been revised 1.4% north over the past two months to $3.55. It also suggests a 6% increase year over year.AvalonBay’s premier portfolio of multi-family apartment communities in the high-barrier-to-entry regions of the United States is well-poised to benefit from the healthy demand for residential properties. Its portfolio diversification efforts and focus on expanding into the suburban markets are likely to aid in generating stable rental revenues over time.We estimate year-over-year growth of 5.3% in total revenues in 2023. This residential REIT is also banking on technology and scale to drive margin expansion. Further, its encouraging development pipeline and solid balance sheet augur well for long-term growth.Per its recent operating update, AvalonBay reported a 5.3% increase in same-store residential rental revenues for the two months ended Aug 31, 2023 compared with the prior-year period. This is roughly 40 basis points higher than the company’s most recent expectation on Jul 31, 2023. This demonstrates its adaptability in the face of market shifts.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 stock. The estimate revision trend for 2023 FFO per share indicates a favorable outlook for the company as it has increased three cents upward over the past month to $10.57. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.SBA Communications' global footprint of extensive wireless communication assets is poised to benefit from increased capital spending by wireless carriers to expand their networks amid accelerated 4G and 5G network deployment efforts.Its long-term leases with its tenants assure stable cash flows. For 2023, we expect a 7.1% year-over-year increase in site-leasing revenues.  Also, the company’s strategic buyouts and portfolio expansion efforts to capitalize on the secular trends of the industry are encouraging.SBA Communications currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 FFO per share has been revised four cents north over the past month to $12.90. It also suggests a 5.4% increase year over year.Essential Properties owns, acquires and manages mainly single-tenant properties, which are net leased to service-oriented and experience-based businesses on a long-term basis. The company serves casual dining, car washes, automotive services, medical services, convenience stores, equipment rental, entertainment, early childhood education and health and fitness sectors.With a portfolio comprising 1,742 freestanding net lease properties with a weighted average lease term of 14 years and a weighted average rent coverage ratio of 4.1 as of Jun 30, 2023, EPRT is well-poised to benefit from the solid fundamentals of the retail real estate market. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company’s portfolio was 99.9% leased, and this reflects the solid demand for the company’s properties.Essential Properties currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 FFO per share has been revised 1.2% upward over the past week to $1.66. It also suggests an 8.5% increase year over year.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The story notes that farmland is a real asset that performs well in inflationary environments, delivers stable returns over long holding periods, and exhibits low correlation to financial assets.So, whether you currently own farmland or are considering investing in this type of natural resource asset, there are a lot of considerations when it comes to management.This is where Regions' Brooks Wall and his team come in. A niche group in the financial industry, Walls' farmland asset team consists of farm managers, account officers, wealth advisors and tax professionals dedicated to helping clients navigate the holistic financial wellbeing of these land assets.""The Natural Resources and Real Estate group was established to manage natural resources and real estate assets held in trust at the bank,"" explained Wall. ""Most bank trust departments hire outside management companies to manage their clients' assets. In 1956, Regions' predecessor First National Bank of Birmingham, brought that function in-house, hiring a team of professionals that really understand the complexities of managing these assets.""With approximately 125,000 acres of farmland under management, Wall and his team are more likely to be found out in the field, quite literally, than in a typical banker's office.In addition to managing these natural resource assets as trustee and fiduciaries for a client's trust, the team can also facilitate agency agreements with landowners.""With an agency agreement, we don't hold the title as we do with trusts, but in these cases, the landowners are still needing someone to manage the land,"" said Wall. ""In many cases it's an aging landowner who just needs a little help or maybe the next generation that doesn't want to sell the farm but doesn't have the time or desire to manage it.""Story continuesOne of our responsibilities as farm managers is making sure clients are aware of and signed up for the appropriate programs. We are also there to help negotiate lease agreements with a reputable farmer to ensure soil health and productivity is maintained.Brooks Wall, Regions Natural Resources asset managerThis is the benefit of an agency agreement, created to help manage these properties for the client while maintaining an income stream and reaching growth potential for the landowner who may have inherited the land or purchased the land as an investment.There are government subsidies available for landowners, but in order to receive those subsidies, you must sign up for the programs,"" said Wall. ""One of our responsibilities as farm managers is making sure clients are aware of and signed up for the appropriate programs. We are also there to help negotiate lease agreements with a reputable farmer to ensure soil health and productivity is maintained.""Regions' clients are also able to take advantage of our affordable liability insurance coverage for their property. Our farm managers work with local crop insurance agents to ensure that our client's crop income is covered at optimum rates specific for each client.While Regions Natural Resources and Real Estate group serves clients throughout the bank's 15-state footprint, the majority of farmland under management is in northwest Alabama, the Tennessee River Valley, Mississippi Delta, Arkansas, Illinois, and Georgia growing key agriculture crops including corn, cotton, soybeans, wheat, and rice. Wall oversees a team of five farm managers, including Jake Pustejovsky, a ranchland manager based in Houston, who also focuses on real estate assets throughout Texas.""Investing in ranchland is a growth opportunity for many looking for alternative assets,"" said Pustejovsky. ""We often serve as trust advisors for our clients who invest in ranchland to either hold as raw land for pure appreciation value and future sale or lease to a rancher as grazing lands or livestock fields.""A growing business, ranchland management and pastureland management are another focus of Regions farmland management team within Natural Resources and Real Estate. Pustejovsky knows firsthand the unique needs and challenges of ranchland owners.We often serve as trust advisors for our clients who invest in ranchland to either hold as raw land for pure appreciation value and future sale or lease to a rancher as grazing lands or livestock fields.Jake Pustejovsky, Regions ranchland manager""On the agency side, ranches are very project- and goal-specific,"" said Pustejovsky. ""We can buy land, sell land, move trees around for different needs. It hits a lot of categories including recreational, livestock, or raw land held for eventual sale for new commercial or residential development.""He noted that while traditional row crop farmland is very consistent, ranching can cover a lot of different aspects - and his focus is working with the ranchland owner to achieve their financial goals.Regions' farmland team recently helped a Mississippi client who was looking to raise cash. With help from the specialized banking team, a portion of the land was sold, and proceeds were used to add irrigation wells and complete some needed land leveling on the remaining tract. The rent on the upgraded property is equal to the rent previously received on the larger non-irrigated land.""Our client was able to raise the money needed, improve the remaining land, increasing its value, and maintaining the income,"" said Wall. ""This is just one example of how our team of farmland managers work with clients and banking professionals to help out clients achieve their financial goals.""For more on Regions Natural Resources and Real Estate:Creating Wealth and Sustainability Through Timberland InvestmentsKeeping the Family Farm: Inheritance and Succession PlanningThis information is general in nature and is not intended to be legal, tax, or financial advice.

The economy is showing signs of some weakening here, when we take a look at the labor market showing some signs here of slowing down. Is the consumer do you think still able or still likely to remain resilient in the coming months, when we look ahead to the very critical holiday season?DAVID FRENCH: So at the moment, American households have about, I think, today is $500 billion in excess savings. That's a cushion. That's going to hold the consumer in a good place through the end of the year, we expect. But, certainly, in the future, tighter credit conditions and other factors are going to test that resiliency a little bit.BRAD SMITH: a swipe fees are increased, what impact would that have on inflation that the Fed can-- they can do all of the policy decision making in their purview. But they're not going to come out with any ruling on swipe fees.DAVID FRENCH: No. Swipe fees-- the question isn't if. It's when. Because there's no competition in the market for credit card swipe fees. Swipe fees always go up. In fact, swipe fees have gone up about 60% since the beginning of the pandemic. Just $22 billion in extra swipe fees last year alone. So we know they're going up. Competition will help retailers and merchants bring those fees back under control.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: While we have you, we've been taking a look through the NRF's outlook for the rest of this year, and especially the holiday season, what s type of spending level expectation or even category expectation, given the number of people that have shifted their spending from goods and into services, and how that is really continuing to drive some of the purchases that are being made. How is that continued to expect-- how is that expected to continue showing up in the data once we get into this holiday season?DAVID FRENCH: Sure. Obviously, there's been a shift back to services, maybe not as much as we expected following the easing of the pandemic. As consumers continue to look forward to their spending choices, we expect consumers will protect their essential spending and pare back in some areas on discretionary spending, including discretionary services.SEANA SMITH: All right. David French, always great to get your insight there. National Retail Federation Senior Vice President of Government Relations. Thanks.DAVID FRENCH: Thanks for having me.]"

These forms of payments were growing at a high clip, but the social distancing restrictions forced many to turn to electronic and digital payments as a means to acquire the items they needed.As a result, the increase in the number of people holding a bank account, which would be needed to pay a credit card bill, grew tremendously during the worst of the pandemic. As recently as 2011, only 51% of adults globally had a bank account. That number improved to 68% by 2017, but jumped to 76% by 2021. This is a remarkable increase in a few short years.Current Trends in Digital PaymentsWarning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with DFS. Click here to check it out. DFS 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DFSIn 2022, nearly two-thirds of all U.S. transactions were made with some card, such as credit, debit, or prepaid. Add in the number of electronic payments made through online bill pay and these methods of payments made up 75% of all transactions last year. By comparison, less than a quarter of transactions were conducted with cash, check, or money order.Figures like this are similar in our developed countries, but it was not the same for lower- and middle-income economies. That has changed due to Covid-19. Prior to the pandemic, it is estimated that approximately 40% of consumers used electronic and digital payments worldwide. Post-pandemic, that number increased to nearly 60% in just three years.Future of Digital PaymentsThese figures are expected to continue to increase in the years ahead as more people around the world become more comfortable with electronic and digital payments. In fact, more than 90% of consumers that have a digital wallet expect that they will continue to use it for purchases.In short, electronic and digital payments are not going anywhere and it is very likely that more consumers will choose to make their purchases in this manner. Therefore, investors interested in this space should focus on high-quality companies that have a dominating market position. Fortunately, there are several names that stand out as possible investment choices, including Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), and Visa Inc (NYSE:V). All three of which happen to be trading at a discount to their intrinsic value.Story continuesDiscover Financial ServicesFirst up is Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) which is a holding company that provides various financial services to its customers. The company has generated revenue of nearly $16 billion over the last year and is valued at just under $22 billion.Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) operates two business segments, Digital Banking and Payment Services. The Payment Services business provides payment processing and settlement services. Direct Banking provides credit cards under the namesake brand Discover as well as loans for individuals and homes and deposit products.Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) has a solid GF Score of 83 out of 100 from GuruFocus, implying the potential for modest returns going forward. Solid ratings for value, growth, and profitability are offset by weaker results for momentum and financial strength.3 Names to Benefit From Growth in Electronic PaymentsDiscover's Investment PotentialThe GF Value Line, however, shows that the stock could be significantly undervalued based on historical ratios, past financial performance, and future earnings projections. Shareholders of Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) could see a 70% return if the stock were to reach its GF Value of $148.63. The dividend yield of 3.2% is one of the highest in the fin tech industry. The company has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years.3 Names to Benefit From Growth in Electronic PaymentsMasterCard IncNext up is Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), one of the largest processors of electronic payments in the world. The company is valued at $382 billion and has produced sales of $24 billion over the last twelve months.Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA)s primary competitive advantages is the sheer size of its business. The company partners with more than 25,000 financial institutions around the world and has more than 3 billion cards in use. Due to its size and scale, Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) is likely to be one of the primary beneficiaries of more the worlds population moving to electronic and digital payments.Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) has an impressive GF Score of 97 out of 100, which is one of the highest scores in the market. This means that the likelihood that the stock will deliver outperformance is high. Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) has perfect scores in the areas of profitability and growth, a near perfect showing for momentum, and moderate results for value and financial strength.3 Names to Benefit From Growth in Electronic PaymentsMasterCard's Investment PotentialThe stocks GF Value Line suggests that the stock is modestly undervalued. With a GF Value of $485.58, shares are trading at a nearly 20% discount to intrinsic value. The stocks yield is just 0.6%, but Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) has raised its dividend for 12 consecutive years.3 Names to Benefit From Growth in Electronic PaymentsVisa IncThe final name for consideration is Visa Inc (NYSE:V), the global leader in digital payments. The company has a market capitalization of $483 billion and has generated close to $32 billion in revenue over the last year.As with Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), Visa Inc (NYSE:V) benefits from its tremendous payment network. The company has operations in more than 200 countries and can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second. Visa Inc (NYSE:V) had more than 4 billion cards in use as of its most recent quarterly filing. Visa Inc (NYSE:V) should also continue to benefit from the trend towards electronic and digital payments due to its reach.Visa Inc (NYSE:V) has a GF Score of 98 out of 100, implying that the stock could also see strong returns. This score is backed by perfect marks for momentum, growth, and profitability. Financial strength and value are slightly lower at 7 out of 10, but still above both Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA)s results.3 Names to Benefit From Growth in Electronic PaymentsVisa's Investment PotentialVisa Inc (NYSE:V)s GF Value Line ranks the stock as modestly undervalued. With a GF Value of $291.93, Visa Inc (NYSE:V) is trading 23% below its intrinsic value. Shares yield just 0.8%, but Visa Inc (NYSE:V) has increased its dividend for the past 15 years.3 Names to Benefit From Growth in Electronic PaymentsFinal ThoughtsThe Covid-19 pandemic escalated the transition to electronic and digital payments. More people than ever have a bank account around the world, which has led to spikes in the number of payments done with something other than cash.This ongoing transition should benefit the largest names in the fin tech space. Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), and Visa Inc (NYSE:V) are three names that should continue to perform well as more of the world conducts its business electronically and digitally.Each name is also trading at a double-digit discount to its GF Value. Therefore, investors looking for value in this space should consider adding these three stocks to their watchlist.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

In its September FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate unchanged at the existing 5.25-5.5%, as stated on Sep 20. However, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell dampened market participants’ sentiments.Although the Fed paused its rate hike in the September FOMC meeting, the current dot-plot has shown a strong likelihood of one more hike of 25 basis points in 2023. That will take the terminal interest rate of this hiking cycle to 5.6%, well above the 5.1% forecast in June. Notably, the current range of the Fed fund rate is the highest level since March 2001.More importantly, the central bank said it would keep interest rates higher for a longer time period. The new projection has shown two maximum rate cuts in 2024 instead of four projected in June. The first cut in interest rate is not expected before September 2024.As a result, the yield on the short-term 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note reached 5.202%, its highest level since 2006. This link is closely linked to the possibility of a near-term economic downturn. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note touched 4.494%, its highest level since 2007.A higher market interest rate is detrimental to high-growth sectors like technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrency. Notably, the crypto space suffered a huge blow last year as the Fed pursued a rigorous interest rate hike regime.Consequently, on Sep 21, prices of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB) slid 1.7%, 1.9%, 1.9%, 2.3% and 1.6%, respectively.Stocks in FocusRobinhood Markets Inc.

The company has seen a 36% rise from bear-market lows since late September 2022 and is gearing up for further gains. This Friday, Visa reported that it processed 54 billion transactions in the past quarter, generating $3.8 trillion in commerce and yielding $8.1 billion in revenue, marking a 12% increase year over year.Visa's business model, which operates as a payment intermediary rather than a lender, shields it from potential pitfalls such as rising prices and record-high credit card balances. It manages a network of merchants and cardholders, retaining a small percentage of every transaction. Consequently, Visa remains unaffected by delinquencies and charge-offs which are absorbed by the issuing banks.However, it is important to note that Visa is not entirely immune to economic downturns. Weak economies can impact card-based spending by consumers and corporations. This risk is relatively minor due to the shift from cash to card payments. According to data from the Federal Reserve, last year only 18% of payments within the United States were cash-based compared to 60% completed with credit or debit cards. This significant change from 2014's figures demonstrates an ongoing shift towards card usage.In its effort to remain competitive and innovative, Visa has established Innovation Centers worldwide to foster industry advancements tailored to local markets. For instance, its Africa Innovation Center has successfully launched a small business card-acceptance solution and a digital wallet compatible with any bank.Furthermore, Visa is venturing into cryptocurrency partnerships to facilitate digital currency spending. The company recently launched a new platform through its Currencycloud arm to simplify cross-border payments - an area projected by the Bank of England to grow from $150 trillion in 2017 to $250 trillion by 2027.Story continuesVisa's stock has shown resilience, bouncing back from occasional setbacks to even higher highs.

(NASDAQ:MAR)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-marriott-international-153311043.html,1695396791,STORY,['MAR'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Marriott International fair value estimate is US$228With US$195 share price, Marriott International appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Analyst price target for MAR is US$208 which is 8.6% below our fair value estimateToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Marriott International The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.96bUS$3.13bUS$3.77bUS$4.05bUS$4.26bUS$4.44bUS$4.60bUS$4.75bUS$4.89bUS$5.02bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 5.24%Est @ 4.31%Est @ 3.66%Est @ 3.21%Est @ 2.89%Est @ 2.67% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% US$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$3.0kUS$3.0kUS$2.9kUS$2.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.4kUS$2.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$27bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.0b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.0%– 2.2%) = US$88bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$88b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$41bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$68b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$195, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Marriott International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.166. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Marriott InternationalStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

(NASDAQ:MARA) (""Marathon"" or ""Company""), a leader in supporting and securing the Bitcoin ecosystem, has completed the pricing period of the previously announced, privately negotiated exchange agreements with certain holders of its 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”). On average, the transactions represent an approximately 21% discount to the par value and result in approximately $101 million in cash savings before transaction costs for the Company.In total, Marathon exchanged $417 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes held by such holders (the “Exchanges”) for an aggregate 31.7 million newly issued shares of Marathon common stock. As a result, the Company has reduced its long-term convertible debt by approximately 56% and realized approximately $101 million in cash savings before transaction costs. Following the Exchanges, $331 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes will remain outstanding.“By exchanging $417 million of our Notes at a 21% discount, we have reduced our long-term convertible debt by 56% and captured a total of approximately $101 million, or $0.55 per share, in cash savings for our shareholders,” said Salman Khan, Marathon’s chief financial officer. “For the first time in two years, Marathon’s combined cash and bitcoin holdings now exceed its convertible debt. By generating savings that exceed the value issued in equity, improving our liquidity, and deleveraging the balance sheet, we believe we have significantly strengthened Marathon’s financial profile.”Figure 1: Marathon Convertible Note Exchange -- Accretion AnalysisMarathon Convertible Note Exchange -- Accretion Analysis             $ in millions except share and per share amounts               Current   Exchange   Pro Forma Enterprise Value $2,277   -  $2,277 Less: Notes Payable1  747.5   (416.8)  330.7 Less: Preferred  15.8   -   15.8 Plus: Cash2  105.5   (8.3)  97.2 Market Cap  1,619       2,028 Shares Outstanding  174.3   31.7   206.0 Equity Value Per Share $9.29      $9.84 Implied Change         $0.55 Accretion %          5.9%             1 Gross notes payable based on the latest publicly available information and as of June 30, 20232 Based on the latest publicly available information and as of August 31, 2023 Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and chief executive officer, added, “We are always looking for the opportunities to increase our resilience and create shareholder value. By opportunistically retiring the majority of our convertible debt, we have strengthened Marathon’s balance sheet in an accretive transaction. We have always maintained a positive outlook on both Marathon’s and Bitcoin’s future, as we now hold over 13,000 bitcoin on our balance sheet and our operations produced approximately 34.3 bitcoin per day in August 2023. With a reduced debt load, we believe Marathon is even better positioned to capitalize on any near-term turbulence in the Bitcoin mining sector including next year’s halving.”Story continuesFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSWhy pay off some of the debt early? Bitcoin’s price can change quickly. Market downturns like the one experienced in 2022 can negatively impact companies with material debt obligations and limit future financing options. While the Company’s debt is not due until 2026, Marathon had an opportunity to strengthen its balance sheet and retire a portion of its debt early in a manner deemed accretive for shareholders.Marathon considered multiple alternatives, including refinancing the Notes. Although refinancing would have extended the repayment terms, the Company would not have been able to reduce its debt load and would have burdened its cash flows with additional interest payments due to higher rates. The Company opted to act opportunistically and retired a portion of its debt prior to maturity.Why does reducing leverage matter?Reducing debt improves Marathon’s balance sheet. It makes the Company more resilient to market downturns, changes in Bitcoin’s price, and halving events. It also increases the Company’s financial optionality and improves Marathon’s position as a reliable and attractive partner. While Marathon maintains a positive outlook on the long-term performance of Bitcoin, the Company believes it is crucial to increase resilience and reduce its risk profile prior to the next Bitcoin halving event.How does this transaction impact Marathon’s financial condition?With this transaction, Marathon has reduced its debt by approximately 56% from $748 million to $331 million. By exchanging $417 million in Notes for $329 million of equity (c. 31.7 million newly issued shares), the Company captured an $88 million discount and removed approximately $13 million in future interest payments on the retired notes. In total, this transaction resulted in approximately $101 million, or $0.55 per share, in savings. For the first time in two years, Marathon’s combined cash and bitcoin holdings now exceed its debt outstanding.Investor Notice Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk.

Assuming, of course, that his moment has actually arrived.On Thursday, his father Rupert Murdoch announced that in November he'll step down as the head of his two media companies: News Corp. and Fox Corp. Lachlan will become the chair of News Corp. while remaining chief executive and chair at Fox Corp., the parent of Fox News Channel.The changes make Rupert's eldest son the undisputed leader of the media empire his father built over decades. There's no real sign that his siblings and former rivals James and Elisabeth contested him for the top job; James in particular has distanced himself from the company and his father's politics for several years. But Rupert, now 92, has long had a penchant for building up his oldest children only to later undermine them — and sometimes to set them against one another — often flipping the table without notice.Given Rupert Murdoch's advanced age, this might be his last power move. But there's a reason the HBO drama “ Succession ” was often interpreted as a thinly disguised and dark satire of his family business. In Murdoch World, as in the fictional world of the Roy family, seemingly sure things can go sideways in an instant, particularly when unexpected opportunities arise.Lachlan Murdoch has lived that first hand. Born in London, he grew up in New York City and attended Princeton, where he focused not on business, but philosophy. His bachelor's thesis, titled “A Study of Freedom and Morality in Kant's Practical Philosophy,” addressed those weighty topics alongside passages of Hindu scripture. The thesis closed on a line from the Bhagavad Gita referencing “the infinite spirit” and “the pure calm of infinity,” according to a 2019 article in The Intercept.Béatrice Longuenesse, Lachlan's thesis advisor at Princeton, confirmed the accuracy of that report via email.After graduation, though, Lachlan plunged headlong into his father's business, moving to Australia to work for the Murdoch newspapers that were once the core of News Corp.'s business. Many assumed he was being groomed for higher things at News Corp., and they were not wrong. Within just a few years, Lachlan was deputy CEO of the News Corp. holding company for its Australian properties; shortly thereafter, he took an executive position at News Corp. itself and was soon running the company's television stations and print publishing operations.Story continuesLachlan's ascent came to an abrupt halt in 2005, when he resigned from News Corp. with no public explanation. According to Paddy Manning, an Australian journalist who last year published a biography of Lachlan Murdoch, the core problem involved two relatively minor issues on which Lachlan disagreed with Roger Ailes, who then ran Fox News.“The real point was that Lachlan felt Rupert had backed his executives over his son,” Manning said in an interview. “So Lachlan felt, 'If I'm not going to be supported, then what's the point?'” Manning did not have direct access to Lachlan for his book “The Successor,” but said he spoke in depth with the people closest to his subject.Lachlan returned to Australia, where he has often described feeling most at home, and founded an investment group that purchased a string of local radio stations among other properties.While he was away, News Corp. entered choppy waters. The U.K. phone-hacking scandal, in which tabloid journalists at the News of the World and other Murdoch-owned publications had found a way to listen to voicemails of the British royal family, journalistic competitors and even a missing schoolgirl, had seriously damaged the company. The fracas led to resignations of several News Corp. officials, criminal charges against some, and the closure of News of the World as its finances went south.Manning said that the damage the scandal inflicted on News Corp. — and on both Lachlan Murdoch's father and his brother James, chief executive of News' British newspaper group at the time — helped pull Lachlan back to the company.“He was watching the family tear itself apart over the phone-hacking scandal,” Manning said. Lachlan was “instrumental in trying to circle the wagons and turn the guns outwards, and stop Rupert from sacking James.”While it took more convincing, Lachlan eventually returned to the company in 2014 as co-chairman of News Corp. alongside James.Not long afterward, Ailes was forced out of his job at Fox News following numerous credible allegations of sexual harassment.Lachlan Murdoch has drawn criticism from media watchdogs for what many called Fox News' increasingly conspiratorial and misinformation-promoting broadcasts. The network hit a nadir following the 2020 election when voting machine company Dominion Voting Systems sued Fox News for $1.6 billion, alleging that Fox knowingly promoted false conspiracy theories about the security of its voting machines.Fox settled that suit for $787.5 million in March of this year. A similar lawsuit filed by Smartmatic, another voting-machine maker, may go to trial in 2025, Fox has suggested.In certain respects, though, Lachlan Murdoch's behavior suggests some ambivalence about his role at News Corp. In 2021 he moved back to Sydney and has been mixing commuting and remote work from Australia ever since. “I think there’s a legitimate question about whether you can continue to do that and for how long” while running companies based in the U.S., Manning said.___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives funding from the Quadrivium foundation, founded by James and Kathryn Murdoch.

Born in London to Murdoch and his second wife, Anna, he grew up steeped in the media business. In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s “Dynasties” program, he said that every morning, before catching the school bus, he and his siblings would read the morning papers - The New York Post, The New York Times, the Daily News and the Wall Street Journal - with his father flagging stories of interest, ordering: “Read that.”The best way to capture their father’s attention in the evenings was to talk about media or politics, according to Paddy Manning’s 2022 biography, “The Successor.” As Lachlan Murdoch got older, he would spend summers working in the family business, cleaning the presses for Sydney’s “Daily Mirror,” or working as a cub reporter for the “San Antonio Express-News.”A rivalry between Lachlan and his younger brother, James, played out from an early age, where even family Monopoly games “were intense and everybody was prepared to cheat,” according to one published account.Lachlan Murdoch and his siblings attended Dalton, a private school on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, and other elite schools, including Trinity School, where he formed the Trinity Conservative Society, “In an attempt to create a healthy balance between all points of view,” according to one yearbook entry cited by Manning.Story continuesAfter graduating in 1994 from Princeton, where he majored in philosophy, he entered the family business, spending three years in Australia, ascending the corporate ladder to become chairman of News Limited.In 1999, Lachlan Murdoch assumed responsibility for print operations in the U.S. He rose to deputy chief operating officer at News Corp, overseeing the company’s U.S. television stations group and publishing assets, including the New York Post. Many saw him as being trained to assume the corporate reins as his father’s successor.He abruptly resigned in 2005, creating questions about who would succeed Rupert Murdoch at the helm of the media empire he had assembled from a single newspaper in Australia. Lachlan Murdoch founded Illyria Pty, a private investment company, whose acquisitions included a network of Australian radio stations. In 2015, he returned to the family business, sharing the title of co-chairman of 21st Century Fox with his brother, James.The sale of Fox’s entertainment assets to Walt Disney in 2019, in a $71-billion transaction, shrank the size of the Murdochs’ once-vast media holdings. The newly constituted Fox was reduced to a handful of assets, including the Fox broadcast network, Fox News, Fox Sports and Fox Business, with Lachlan Murdoch serving as its executive chair and chief executive officer.Brother James Murdoch left Fox with the close of the Disney transaction.As chief executive of Fox Corp since 2019, Lachlan Murdoch has presided over the media properties during seismic change in the industry, as viewers cut their cable subscriptions in favor of streaming services. Even so, Fox News has largely maintained its rating dominance, in part because of its appeal among politically conservative-leaning American viewers.Lachlan Murdoch doesn’t speak publicly about his politics, according to an article in the New York Times magazine, which cited the 2016 memoir ""Making Headlines,"" by Chris Mitchell, the longtime editor of The Australian, as describing “Lachlan’s conservatism is more vigorous than that of any Australian politician” and that his views were usually to the right of his father’s.A Fox spokesperson called that ""just speculation,"" adding ""I wouldn't want to put a label on him, but it wouldn't be unfair to categorize him as a conservative.""Fox’s loyalty to those viewers became a hot-button issue during discovery for Dominion Voting Systems’ lawsuit against Fox, in which the voting technology firm claimed that Fox perpetuated falsehoods about its voting machines in an effort to appease the network’s base of supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump. Fox settled the lawsuit for $787.5 million in April, avoiding a trial in which Lachlan and his father were expected to testify.In public remarks in the weeks following the settlement, Lachlan said that Fox had been acting as a news organization reporting on the newsworthy events of the day, and recommitted to Fox’s programming strategy.While Rupert Murdoch built his legacy pursuing the television, movie and newspaper businesses with equal abandon, Lachlan’s legacy is still taking shape. In calls with investors, he often becomes animated when speaking about Tubi, an ad-supported streaming service that the company acquired for $440 million in 2020, and which is now valued at $3 billion.Lachlan Murdoch's family lives in Sydney, Australia, and he travels to Los Angeles, where Fox is based and they also maintain a home.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles and Helen Coster in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Nick Zieminski)]"

Here’s a look into the real-life succession drama that roiled his family and inspired a hit HBO show,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rupert-murdoch-retiring-look-real-174113370.html,1695404473,STORY,"['NWSA', 'FOXA', 'DIS']","[Spoiler alert: The withering patriarch of Succession, Logan Roy, never stepped down as CEO of a media conglomerate before passing away, nor did he nail down a succession plan. But the real-life Logan Roy just did. Business magnate and media mogul Rupert Murdoch, 92, announced on Thursday that he’s retiring as chairman at Fox Corporation and News Corp. in mid-November after a seven-decade career.Despite the HBO drama creator Jesse Armstrong’s reminders that the characters are fictional and “no one family unlocks” them, the Roys have an uncanny resemblance to the Murdochs—a powerful, aging media executive who watches his children vie for control of the empire. Sound familiar? The similarities are apparent enough that Rupert Murdoch barred his ex-wife Jerry Hall from giving story ideas to Succession writers in their divorce settlement.Logan Roy, played by Brian Cox, is widely thought to be a composite of Murdoch and another media baron, the deceased Sumner Redstone, whose real-life story is even more dramatic than any HBO show, as captured in the recent book Unscripted (on which a new TV series may soon be based). But it’s the laundry list of similarities between Murdoch and the Waystar Royco CEO that makes them the closest analogues—from their foreign origins and numerous health scares, speeches atop printer paper podiums, multiple marriages and divorces, and, of course, pitting their children against each other while encouraging them to compete to be anointed as successor.The rivalry between Roman and Kendall Roy bears a striking resemblance to Lachlan and James Murdoch. Here’s a look at the Fox News succession—and who came out on top.Lachlan and JamesAlthough it’s been clear for a while, now it’s official: Murdoch said on Thursday that he’s handing the reins to his 52-year-old son Lachlan, who will become the sole chair of News Corp. and continue as executive chair and CEO of Fox Corporation.Lachlan, his older sister Elisabeth, and younger brother James have long been contenders for the top job. But Lachlan has seemingly always been Rupert’s “number-one boy” and the preferred choice to succeed him, Vanity Fair reported in May. Murdoch has suggested as much:Story continues""Currently it is their consensus that Lachlan will take over,"" Murdoch said in a 1997 interview, as reported by The Guardian. ""He will be the first among equals, but they will all have to prove themselves.""At first glance, Lachlan draws obvious comparisons to Kendall. Both are eldest sons who have been groomed to take over the family business one day. But in terms of personality, Lachlan more closely resembles Roman, the snarky, impulsive younger brother portrayed by Kieran Culkin.In 2005, Lachlan had a dispute with then-boss of Fox News, Roger Ailes—the same Ailes who was later sued by Fox host Gretchen Carlson for sexual harassment, which the movie Bombshell (featuring Margot Robbie and Nicole Kidman) was based. Lachlan quit his role as deputy COO of News Corp. and moved to Australia. He returned to the states nearly 10 years later at his father’s behest, agreeing to be his heir.But during Lachlan’s decade overseas, his younger brother, the now 50-year-old James, became the heir apparent. James spent those years climbing through the ranks, ensuring the longevity and respect of his father’s media empire by making deals with the likes of Hulu and National Geographic Channel and promising that News Corp. would go carbon neutral. His father bringing Lachlan back was like a “big slap in the face” to the younger brother, a source told Vanity Fair.James resembles Kendall in that he was known as “the smart one” and has been baited by his father for the top job for decades. James has served in high-ranking roles in News Corp. and even did a stint in Hong Kong, reminiscent of Kendall’s time in Shanghai. Jeremy Strong, the actor who portrays Kendall, told The New Yorker that he used details about James to prepare for the role.Disney and DominionIn August 2017, Murdoch and Disney CEO Bob Iger discussed selling 21st Century Fox’s assets to Disney. Lachlan and James clashed over the deal—Lachlan felt that his father and brother were rushing to sell his future empire out from underneath him, while James thought it was a good business opportunity, according to Vanity Fair. Not to mention, James was in talks with Iger to take a high-level position at Disney post-acquisition, the outlet reported.The deal went through. Disney acquired the 21st Century Fox movie and television studios for more than $52 billion in March 2019. Lachlan was left to run what remained—Fox News and the remaining assets—and James took his money and left to start a media fund called Lupa Systems. (The word lupa is Italian for “she-wolf,” like the one that raised the founding brothers of Rome—Romulus and Remus—before Romulus murdered Remus, Vanity Fair noted.)Then Fox News got involved with Trump. In 2020, Murdoch’s right-wing news network became the town crier of theories that the presidential election was stolen, asserting that voting machines owned by Dominion Voting Systems switched Americans’ votes to Biden after they’d voted for Trump. In response, Dominion brought a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit in March 2021 against Fox News, claiming that Murdoch protected Fox’s ratings by allowing hosts and guests to perpetuate the conspiracy. Two years later, Fox agreed to pay Dominion a $787 million settlement, and Fox host Tucker Carlson was fired.Elisabeth and PrudenceThe Succession inspirations go beyond Lachlan and James. Elisabeth is comparable to Siobhan (better known as Shiv), the sharp and poised daughter who originally pursued a career outside of her father’s empire and could run the company just as well if only she weren’t a woman in an ultra-conservative, male-dominated industry. Meanwhile, Prudence Murdoch resembles Connor Roy as she is the only child from the patriarch’s first marriage and is often considered the forgotten sibling.Lachlan and James don’t talk anymore. James has distanced himself from Fox News for its climate denialism, white nationalism, and election conspiracies. And now that Lachlan holds the keys to the kingdom, James is biding his time to oust his brother with the help of their sisters, Elisabeth and Prudence, once their father is gone, sources told Vanity Fair.People close to the Murdochs weren’t sure what James would do with Fox if he managed to win it back, but they assumed that he’d completely overhaul the organization or sell it off to the highest bidder.“James sees destroying Fox News as his mission in life,” a senior Fox staffer told Vanity Fair.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

It is the vehicle through which the elder Murdoch controls News Corp and Fox Corp, through a roughly 40% stake in voting shares of each company. Murdoch also holds a small amount of shares of the companies outside of the trust.Upon Rupert’s death, News Corp and Fox Corp voting shares will be transferred from Murdoch to his four oldest children – Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James – creating a scenario in which three of the children could out-vote a fourth, potentially setting up a battle over the future of the companies, even as Lachlan Murdoch runs Fox Corp and is the sole chair of News Corp.This tension would likely play out over the future of Fox News, one of the most polarizing properties in the Murdoch empire, and an influential force in U.S. politics, particularly among Republicans who prize Fox's conservative-leaning audience.While Lachlan Murdoch does not speak publicly about his political views, James Murdoch has been more forthright. In January 2020, he and his wife Kathryn took aim at both News Corp and Fox Corp for downplaying the impact of climate change, widely viewed as a contributing factor to the Australian bushfires, in a statement to The Daily Beast.In a July 31, 2020 letter tendering his resignation from News Corp’s board of directors, which was disclosed in a News Corp filing, James Murdoch said he was resigning ""due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company's news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.""Story continuesMultiple media outlets, including the New York Times, Vanity Fair and the Financial Times, have reported on tension between the brothers over the direction of Fox and other family-controlled media outlets.In a 2021 FT interview, James Murdoch appeared to slam the channel without naming Fox News in comments about the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol siege. “The sacking of the Capitol is proof positive that what we thought was dangerous is indeed very, very much so,” he said. “Those outlets that propagate lies to their audience have unleashed insidious and uncontrollable forces that will be with us for years.”The Murdoch Family Trust has eight votes: four of which are controlled by Murdoch, and the remaining four controlled by the four children from his first two marriages. Murdoch’s youngest daughters Chloe and Grace, from his third wife Wendi Deng, do not have voting rights in the trust.Upon succession, the four older children will equally inherit Murdoch’s voting shares in the trust, according to Alice Enders, head of research at Enders Analysis.In addition to shares in News Corp and Fox, the trust also includes the Cruden family farm near Melbourne and Murdoch’s art collection, according to a January 2023 Financial Times report.Fox and News Corp have a dual-share system, with non-voting Class A shares and voting Class B shares. The shares in Fox and News Corp owned by Murdoch’s children through the trust are a combination of both classes of shares.“It’s not like a real succession scenario right now, this minute,” said Enders. “It’s more in the future I’d say.” (Reporting by Helen Coster in New York and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Stephen Coates and Marguerita Choy)]"

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with NSP. Click here to check it out. SNA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SNAAs of 2023-09-22, Snap-on Inc(NYSE:SNA)'s intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $321.43. It's currently trading at a price of $256.79. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 20.11%. The company is modestly undervalued.Beyond Market Price: Uncovering Snap-on Inc's Intrinsic ValueThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Snap-on Inc(NYSE:SNA)'s intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$18.05GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.44%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 11.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=185.95Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=135.48Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=321.43Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $300.70. This valuation indicates that the Snap-on Inc(NYSE:SNA) is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 14.6%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 89% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of KLA, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for KLA ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About KLA?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.KLA already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see KLA's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in KLA. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. With 8.0% and 4.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and PRIMECAP Management Company are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 17 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of KLAWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that KLA Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$86m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 11% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over KLA. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

(NYSE:TPR), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$44.46 and falling to the lows of US$29.35. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Tapestry's current trading price of US$29.35 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Tapestry’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Tapestry What's The Opportunity In Tapestry?Great news for investors – Tapestry is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Tapestry’s ratio of 7.13x is below its peer average of 13.13x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Luxury industry. However, given that Tapestry’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Tapestry generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Tapestry's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since TPR is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic profit outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TPR for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy TPR. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed assessment.If you want to dive deeper into Tapestry, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

Currently trading at the lower end of its range, which has swung between US$29.35 and US$44.46, the company's shares could potentially present a buying opportunity for investors.The company's valuation can be assessed through its price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, a key metric that underlines Tapestry's value proposition. Currently, Tapestry's PE ratio stands at 7.13x, lower than the luxury industry's average of 13.13x. This indicates that compared to its peers, Tapestry's stock is trading at a discount.However, potential investors should consider the stock's high beta value before investing.

Assuming, of course, that his moment has actually arrived.On Thursday, his father Rupert Murdoch announced that in November he'll step down as the head of his two media companies: News Corp. and Fox Corp. Lachlan will become the chair of News Corp. while remaining chief executive and chair at Fox Corp., the parent of Fox News Channel.The changes make Rupert's eldest son the undisputed leader of the media empire his father built over decades. There's no real sign that his siblings and former rivals James and Elisabeth contested him for the top job; James in particular has distanced himself from the company and his father's politics for several years. But Rupert, now 92, has long had a penchant for building up his oldest children only to later undermine them — and sometimes to set them against one another — often flipping the table without notice.Given Rupert Murdoch's advanced age, this might be his last power move. But there's a reason the HBO drama “ Succession ” was often interpreted as a thinly disguised and dark satire of his family business. In Murdoch World, as in the fictional world of the Roy family, seemingly sure things can go sideways in an instant, particularly when unexpected opportunities arise.Lachlan Murdoch has lived that first hand. Born in London, he grew up in New York City and attended Princeton, where he focused not on business, but philosophy. His bachelor's thesis, titled “A Study of Freedom and Morality in Kant's Practical Philosophy,” addressed those weighty topics alongside passages of Hindu scripture. The thesis closed on a line from the Bhagavad Gita referencing “the infinite spirit” and “the pure calm of infinity,” according to a 2019 article in The Intercept.Béatrice Longuenesse, Lachlan's thesis advisor at Princeton, confirmed the accuracy of that report via email.After graduation, though, Lachlan plunged headlong into his father's business, moving to Australia to work for the Murdoch newspapers that were once the core of News Corp.'s business. Many assumed he was being groomed for higher things at News Corp., and they were not wrong. Within just a few years, Lachlan was deputy CEO of the News Corp. holding company for its Australian properties; shortly thereafter, he took an executive position at News Corp. itself and was soon running the company's television stations and print publishing operations.Story continuesLachlan's ascent came to an abrupt halt in 2005, when he resigned from News Corp. with no public explanation. According to Paddy Manning, an Australian journalist who last year published a biography of Lachlan Murdoch, the core problem involved two relatively minor issues on which Lachlan disagreed with Roger Ailes, who then ran Fox News.“The real point was that Lachlan felt Rupert had backed his executives over his son,” Manning said in an interview. “So Lachlan felt, 'If I'm not going to be supported, then what's the point?'” Manning did not have direct access to Lachlan for his book “The Successor,” but said he spoke in depth with the people closest to his subject.Lachlan returned to Australia, where he has often described feeling most at home, and founded an investment group that purchased a string of local radio stations among other properties.While he was away, News Corp. entered choppy waters. The U.K. phone-hacking scandal, in which tabloid journalists at the News of the World and other Murdoch-owned publications had found a way to listen to voicemails of the British royal family, journalistic competitors and even a missing schoolgirl, had seriously damaged the company. The fracas led to resignations of several News Corp. officials, criminal charges against some, and the closure of News of the World as its finances went south.Manning said that the damage the scandal inflicted on News Corp. — and on both Lachlan Murdoch's father and his brother James, chief executive of News' British newspaper group at the time — helped pull Lachlan back to the company.“He was watching the family tear itself apart over the phone-hacking scandal,” Manning said. Lachlan was “instrumental in trying to circle the wagons and turn the guns outwards, and stop Rupert from sacking James.”While it took more convincing, Lachlan eventually returned to the company in 2014 as co-chairman of News Corp. alongside James.Not long afterward, Ailes was forced out of his job at Fox News following numerous credible allegations of sexual harassment.Lachlan Murdoch has drawn criticism from media watchdogs for what many called Fox News' increasingly conspiratorial and misinformation-promoting broadcasts. The network hit a nadir following the 2020 election when voting machine company Dominion Voting Systems sued Fox News for $1.6 billion, alleging that Fox knowingly promoted false conspiracy theories about the security of its voting machines.Fox settled that suit for $787.5 million in March of this year. A similar lawsuit filed by Smartmatic, another voting-machine maker, may go to trial in 2025, Fox has suggested.In certain respects, though, Lachlan Murdoch's behavior suggests some ambivalence about his role at News Corp. In 2021 he moved back to Sydney and has been mixing commuting and remote work from Australia ever since. “I think there’s a legitimate question about whether you can continue to do that and for how long” while running companies based in the U.S., Manning said.___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives funding from the Quadrivium foundation, founded by James and Kathryn Murdoch.

233,a9aec124-af72-3bde-b407-a2d348d12775,FOX,2023-09-23,Rupert Murdoch isn’t going anywhere just yet,The Economist,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rupert-murdoch-isn-t-going-194454524.html,1695411894,STORY,"['FOXA', 'DIS']","[“TO WALK AWAY and retire, it’s a pretty dismal prospect,” Rupert Murdoch told an interviewer in 1998, when he was already well into pensionable age. If he ever did stop working, he added, he would “die pretty quickly”.So the announcement on September 21st that the 92-year-old is stepping down as chairman of Fox Corporation and News Corp, the television and newspaper empires he has built up over more than 70 years, should be treated with some scepticism. Mr Murdoch will stay on as “chairman emeritus” and says he will remain “involved every day in the contest of ideas”. This week he advised staff: “When I visit your countries and companies, you can expect to see me in the office late on a Friday.” It was both a promise and a warning.The handover of Mr Murdoch’s empire has been a gradual process. He has shied away from earnings calls since the sale of 21st Century Fox, the bulk of his film and TV assets, to Disney in 2019. The question of succession was in effect settled the following year, when James Murdoch, the younger son and sometime heir apparent, left the News Corp board, citing “disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions”. This left the path clear for Mr Murdoch’s elder son, Lachlan, who will take over from his father at the two family firms.Why the change in titles now? Mr Murdoch said in his letter to staff this week that he was in robust health. But investors have recently begun to question those assurances. Vanity Fair reported in April that he had quietly suffered a series of health problems including a broken back, seizures and two bouts of pneumonia. His testimony in a recent legal case against Fox brought by Dominion Voting Systems, which accused the company of damaging its reputation, seemed to lack some of the mogul’s old sharpness.These concerns have coincided with a series of missteps. Fox pursued a calamitous legal strategy in the Dominion case, eventually paying up nearly $800m to settle it. (A related case brought by another voting-technology company, Smartmatic, is expected to go to trial in 2025; Smartmatic is seeking $2.7bn.) It has suffered public spats with some of its anchors, including Tucker Carlson, who was jettisoned in April and has since set himself up on the social network formerly known as Twitter. And an attempt by Mr Murdoch to unify his two companies earlier this year was shot down by shareholders.Story continuesThose investors may be reassured by Mr Murdoch’s more modest new title. In recent years analysts have come to speak of a “Murdoch discount” applied to Fox and News Corp. Mr Murdoch’s new title means that “his interface with the public markets is over,” says Claire Enders, a media analyst. “But it is obvious that he is the ultimate decision-maker as long as he is alive.”That is reflected nowhere so clearly as his choice of successor. Mr Murdoch set up a decades-long audition between three of his children: Elisabeth, Lachlan and James (his eldest child, Prudence, has mostly stayed away from the company; his two youngest children by another marriage, Grace and Chloe, are still in their early 20s). Though it was James who set up the auction of 21st Century Fox, selling to Disney at the top of the market for $71bn, the job has gone to Lachlan, the child who gets on best with his father. Whereas James and Elisabeth have both criticised the political positions of their father’s companies, Lachlan appears to share the elder Murdoch’s politics. Any changes are likely to be minor: perhaps a little more focus on streaming (Tubi, Fox’s advertising-supported streamer, is performing well) and less on British news media (TalkTV, a recent venture there, has not been a big hit so far).When Murdoch père eventually dies, things may change more. Control of the family trust, which ultimately holds sway over both companies, will pass to the four eldest siblings. The newspaper and television industries are both going through a bumpy digital transition, opening up new possibilities. Assets such as Fox News could be changed, or sold off, when the next generation takes control. But it may be a while before that happens. Mr Murdoch’s mother lived to be 103. One person close to the family, asked what will happen when Mr Murdoch passes, reports simply: “He insists he won’t.”© 2023 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

Born in London to Murdoch and his second wife, Anna, he grew up steeped in the media business. In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s “Dynasties” program, he said that every morning, before catching the school bus, he and his siblings would read the morning papers - The New York Post, The New York Times, the Daily News and the Wall Street Journal - with his father flagging stories of interest, ordering: “Read that.”The best way to capture their father’s attention in the evenings was to talk about media or politics, according to Paddy Manning’s 2022 biography, “The Successor.” As Lachlan Murdoch got older, he would spend summers working in the family business, cleaning the presses for Sydney’s “Daily Mirror,” or working as a cub reporter for the “San Antonio Express-News.”A rivalry between Lachlan and his younger brother, James, played out from an early age, where even family Monopoly games “were intense and everybody was prepared to cheat,” according to one published account.Lachlan Murdoch and his siblings attended Dalton, a private school on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, and other elite schools, including Trinity School, where he formed the Trinity Conservative Society, “In an attempt to create a healthy balance between all points of view,” according to one yearbook entry cited by Manning.Story continuesAfter graduating in 1994 from Princeton, where he majored in philosophy, he entered the family business, spending three years in Australia, ascending the corporate ladder to become chairman of News Limited.In 1999, Lachlan Murdoch assumed responsibility for print operations in the U.S. He rose to deputy chief operating officer at News Corp, overseeing the company’s U.S. television stations group and publishing assets, including the New York Post. Many saw him as being trained to assume the corporate reins as his father’s successor.He abruptly resigned in 2005, creating questions about who would succeed Rupert Murdoch at the helm of the media empire he had assembled from a single newspaper in Australia. Lachlan Murdoch founded Illyria Pty, a private investment company, whose acquisitions included a network of Australian radio stations. In 2015, he returned to the family business, sharing the title of co-chairman of 21st Century Fox with his brother, James.The sale of Fox’s entertainment assets to Walt Disney in 2019, in a $71-billion transaction, shrank the size of the Murdochs’ once-vast media holdings. The newly constituted Fox was reduced to a handful of assets, including the Fox broadcast network, Fox News, Fox Sports and Fox Business, with Lachlan Murdoch serving as its executive chair and chief executive officer.Brother James Murdoch left Fox with the close of the Disney transaction.As chief executive of Fox Corp since 2019, Lachlan Murdoch has presided over the media properties during seismic change in the industry, as viewers cut their cable subscriptions in favor of streaming services. Even so, Fox News has largely maintained its rating dominance, in part because of its appeal among politically conservative-leaning American viewers.Lachlan Murdoch doesn’t speak publicly about his politics, according to an article in the New York Times magazine, which cited the 2016 memoir ""Making Headlines,"" by Chris Mitchell, the longtime editor of The Australian, as describing “Lachlan’s conservatism is more vigorous than that of any Australian politician” and that his views were usually to the right of his father’s.A Fox spokesperson called that ""just speculation,"" adding ""I wouldn't want to put a label on him, but it wouldn't be unfair to categorize him as a conservative.""Fox’s loyalty to those viewers became a hot-button issue during discovery for Dominion Voting Systems’ lawsuit against Fox, in which the voting technology firm claimed that Fox perpetuated falsehoods about its voting machines in an effort to appease the network’s base of supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump. Fox settled the lawsuit for $787.5 million in April, avoiding a trial in which Lachlan and his father were expected to testify.In public remarks in the weeks following the settlement, Lachlan said that Fox had been acting as a news organization reporting on the newsworthy events of the day, and recommitted to Fox’s programming strategy.While Rupert Murdoch built his legacy pursuing the television, movie and newspaper businesses with equal abandon, Lachlan’s legacy is still taking shape. In calls with investors, he often becomes animated when speaking about Tubi, an ad-supported streaming service that the company acquired for $440 million in 2020, and which is now valued at $3 billion.Lachlan Murdoch's family lives in Sydney, Australia, and he travels to Los Angeles, where Fox is based and they also maintain a home.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles and Helen Coster in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Nick Zieminski)]"
235,bc5bb118-bd31-393c-b385-b0857e0a90b1,FOX,2023-09-23,Rupert Murdoch is retiring. Here’s a look into the real-life succession drama that roiled his family and inspired a hit HBO show,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rupert-murdoch-retiring-look-real-174113370.html,1695404473,STORY,"['NWSA', 'FOXA', 'DIS']","[Spoiler alert: The withering patriarch of Succession, Logan Roy, never stepped down as CEO of a media conglomerate before passing away, nor did he nail down a succession plan. But the real-life Logan Roy just did. Business magnate and media mogul Rupert Murdoch, 92, announced on Thursday that he’s retiring as chairman at Fox Corporation and News Corp. in mid-November after a seven-decade career.Despite the HBO drama creator Jesse Armstrong’s reminders that the characters are fictional and “no one family unlocks” them, the Roys have an uncanny resemblance to the Murdochs—a powerful, aging media executive who watches his children vie for control of the empire. Sound familiar? The similarities are apparent enough that Rupert Murdoch barred his ex-wife Jerry Hall from giving story ideas to Succession writers in their divorce settlement.Logan Roy, played by Brian Cox, is widely thought to be a composite of Murdoch and another media baron, the deceased Sumner Redstone, whose real-life story is even more dramatic than any HBO show, as captured in the recent book Unscripted (on which a new TV series may soon be based). But it’s the laundry list of similarities between Murdoch and the Waystar Royco CEO that makes them the closest analogues—from their foreign origins and numerous health scares, speeches atop printer paper podiums, multiple marriages and divorces, and, of course, pitting their children against each other while encouraging them to compete to be anointed as successor.The rivalry between Roman and Kendall Roy bears a striking resemblance to Lachlan and James Murdoch. Here’s a look at the Fox News succession—and who came out on top.Lachlan and JamesAlthough it’s been clear for a while, now it’s official: Murdoch said on Thursday that he’s handing the reins to his 52-year-old son Lachlan, who will become the sole chair of News Corp. and continue as executive chair and CEO of Fox Corporation.Lachlan, his older sister Elisabeth, and younger brother James have long been contenders for the top job. But Lachlan has seemingly always been Rupert’s “number-one boy” and the preferred choice to succeed him, Vanity Fair reported in May. Murdoch has suggested as much:Story continues""Currently it is their consensus that Lachlan will take over,"" Murdoch said in a 1997 interview, as reported by The Guardian. ""He will be the first among equals, but they will all have to prove themselves.""At first glance, Lachlan draws obvious comparisons to Kendall. Both are eldest sons who have been groomed to take over the family business one day. But in terms of personality, Lachlan more closely resembles Roman, the snarky, impulsive younger brother portrayed by Kieran Culkin.In 2005, Lachlan had a dispute with then-boss of Fox News, Roger Ailes—the same Ailes who was later sued by Fox host Gretchen Carlson for sexual harassment, which the movie Bombshell (featuring Margot Robbie and Nicole Kidman) was based. Lachlan quit his role as deputy COO of News Corp. and moved to Australia. He returned to the states nearly 10 years later at his father’s behest, agreeing to be his heir.But during Lachlan’s decade overseas, his younger brother, the now 50-year-old James, became the heir apparent. James spent those years climbing through the ranks, ensuring the longevity and respect of his father’s media empire by making deals with the likes of Hulu and National Geographic Channel and promising that News Corp. would go carbon neutral. His father bringing Lachlan back was like a “big slap in the face” to the younger brother, a source told Vanity Fair.James resembles Kendall in that he was known as “the smart one” and has been baited by his father for the top job for decades. James has served in high-ranking roles in News Corp. and even did a stint in Hong Kong, reminiscent of Kendall’s time in Shanghai. Jeremy Strong, the actor who portrays Kendall, told The New Yorker that he used details about James to prepare for the role.Disney and DominionIn August 2017, Murdoch and Disney CEO Bob Iger discussed selling 21st Century Fox’s assets to Disney. Lachlan and James clashed over the deal—Lachlan felt that his father and brother were rushing to sell his future empire out from underneath him, while James thought it was a good business opportunity, according to Vanity Fair. Not to mention, James was in talks with Iger to take a high-level position at Disney post-acquisition, the outlet reported.The deal went through. Disney acquired the 21st Century Fox movie and television studios for more than $52 billion in March 2019. Lachlan was left to run what remained—Fox News and the remaining assets—and James took his money and left to start a media fund called Lupa Systems. (The word lupa is Italian for “she-wolf,” like the one that raised the founding brothers of Rome—Romulus and Remus—before Romulus murdered Remus, Vanity Fair noted.)Then Fox News got involved with Trump. In 2020, Murdoch’s right-wing news network became the town crier of theories that the presidential election was stolen, asserting that voting machines owned by Dominion Voting Systems switched Americans’ votes to Biden after they’d voted for Trump. In response, Dominion brought a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit in March 2021 against Fox News, claiming that Murdoch protected Fox’s ratings by allowing hosts and guests to perpetuate the conspiracy. Two years later, Fox agreed to pay Dominion a $787 million settlement, and Fox host Tucker Carlson was fired.Elisabeth and PrudenceThe Succession inspirations go beyond Lachlan and James. Elisabeth is comparable to Siobhan (better known as Shiv), the sharp and poised daughter who originally pursued a career outside of her father’s empire and could run the company just as well if only she weren’t a woman in an ultra-conservative, male-dominated industry. Meanwhile, Prudence Murdoch resembles Connor Roy as she is the only child from the patriarch’s first marriage and is often considered the forgotten sibling.Lachlan and James don’t talk anymore. James has distanced himself from Fox News for its climate denialism, white nationalism, and election conspiracies. And now that Lachlan holds the keys to the kingdom, James is biding his time to oust his brother with the help of their sisters, Elisabeth and Prudence, once their father is gone, sources told Vanity Fair.People close to the Murdochs weren’t sure what James would do with Fox if he managed to win it back, but they assumed that he’d completely overhaul the organization or sell it off to the highest bidder.“James sees destroying Fox News as his mission in life,” a senior Fox staffer told Vanity Fair.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

Bryan Salesky is probably familiar with many of them. The CEO and founder of Stack AV is taking a shot at Class 8 autonomous trucking with the backing of Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp.Salesky is holding back on a lot of details of his new company, founded earlier this year with longtime collaborators Peter Rander and Brett Browning. The three oversaw Argo AI, a Level 4 autonomous vehicle company backed by Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG once valued at $12.4 billion.The automakers owned more than 80% of Argo AI and shut it down in October after hundreds of millions in losses.I spoke with Salesky the day after Stack AV’s Sept. 7 emergence from stealth mode.Bryan Salesky, founder and CEO of autonomous trucking startup Stack AV. (Photo: Stack AV)TRUCK TECH: What is it they say about startups and failure? You don’t succeed without it, or something like that?SALESKY: Well, yeah, it’s been an interesting few years. But this is what we do. This is our life’s work. So, we’re not going to be deterred from that.TRUCK TECH: How many lessons from Argo translate to your new venture?SALESKY: We’re not getting into anything on Argo. We’re focused on the forward state. What’s neat about this team is that we’ve got a lot of experience in automating just about anything with wheels or tracks.TRUCK TECH: How much catching up in Level 4 autonomy do you feel lies ahead?SALESKY: It’s still early days for this industry. No one’s actually scaled anything yet. None of these businesses work unless [they are] able to assemble a team to build a technology. We know how to do that. And [they have to] assemble the capital to see through the various phases of development and actually get to scale. We have that with SoftBank. So, we’re pretty excited about our chances.TRUCK TECH: Stack is a word that gets tossed around a lot in autonomous efforts. How did you settle on that as a name?SALESKY: Naming is difficult in any industry, right? But, we came up with a name that I think has both a literal and figurative idea behind it. So, you could imagine moving stacks of material, but you could also imagine that there’s obviously a pretty sizable tech stack that has to be built.Story continuesTRUCK TECH: You mentioned your work at the National Robotics Engineering Center at Carnegie Mellon University in the 2000s was pretty far-reaching.SALESKY: No one was really talking about self-driving back then. But they would talk about the three D’s — dull, dirty, dangerous — as the good first applications for robotics. I led the software engineering for the Cat (Caterpillar) Autonomous Mining program. These vehicles are larger than your house. They are all now into production using the system that we created.TRUCK TECH: And that translates to heavy-duty trucking?SALESKY: [We] have learned over the years how to handle and how to build autonomy systems for heavy machinery. And we’ll be able to take that knowledge and bake it into what we’re doing at Stack.TRUCK TECH: Your announcement was light on details of Stack AV. Any hints?SALESKY: We’re focused on Class 8 trucks, and there’s a lot of white space even in that category. We’re looking at the business models. There’s really attractive economics throughout that vertical. We’re not getting into the specifics of exactly what we’re going to be automating just yet.TRUCK TECH: SoftBank is reportedly putting $1 billion or more into Stack. What is their motivation?SALESKY: AI is a strategic priority for SoftBank. They’re committed to investing in companies across a wide range of applications because they believe in the benefits that AI has to society and solving societal issues. When SoftBank invests, they typically invest big because they understand these are complex, capital-intensive businesses. So for us, the backing of SoftBank, I think, is signal enough that this is both a priority for them as well as something that they intend to see through.TRUCK TECH: Other autonomous trucking developers have partnered with manufacturers to create redundant chassis. Will Stack?SALESKY: There is a lot of redundancy that needs to be built into these trucks. Many of the vehicles in production today don’t necessarily have all of the equipment that you need. That creates the question of how do you accomplish that? We’re formulating our view on that. We’re certainly looking at a number of options, and partnering would be one of them.A rendering of a Stack AV autonomous truck.

(CARB).Actually, Hyliion and engine provider Cummins Inc. received a Dual Executive Order certifying the Hyliion powertrain meets California environmental requirements when paired with the Cummins’ ISX12N natural gas engine.This is a big deal because it qualifies Hyliion to count in the Advanced Clean Trucks and Advanced Clean Fleets mandates in the state that will phase out new diesel-powered trucks by 2035. The first 30 Hypertruck ERX systems will be sold in California, where they qualify for a 75% credit under the ACT rule and 100% under ACF.Approval has a ‘limited shelf life’However, the win has limits. Cummins is retiring its 9-liter and 12-liter engines in favor of a new 10-liter engine. Hyliion already was planning to move the ERX to Cummins’ 15-liter natural gas engine, which goes into production next year.“CARB is not going to extend the 12-liter certification into 2024,” Hyliion CEO Thomas Healy told me. “This has a limited shelf life, but it tees up the certification of the 15-liter as well. Once you go through one, it’s a lot of duplicative carryover into the next. It shows CARB is approving of this solution and so when the 15-liter does come, we’ll get that certification as well.”Until then, Hyliion can ship to 47 other states. It is bypassing Hawaii and Alaska.Hyliion’s product progression moves to its Karno generator technology acquired from General Electric, but that has more development ahead and is initially planned for stationary power applications. A prototype hydrogen fuel cell truck with Hyzon Motors is in track testing. It is similar to other hydrogen-powered fuel cell trucks. Healy’s skepticism of hydrogen adoption remains.“The next step here is to figure out ‘Do fleets really want it?’” he said. “That’s something we’ve got to go through with Hyzon now that the truck’s done. Hydrogen adoption is going to be very specialized.”Hyliion received a Dual Executive Order from the California Air Resources Board allowing it to sell its Hypertruck ERX powertrain system when paired with Cummins’ 12-liter natural gas engine.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the streaming industry and recent trends shaping the streaming market, go directly to 5 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy Now. Streaming has become an integral part of our daily lives, from watching movies and TV shows to listening to music and playing games. The rise of streaming services has been incredible, and there are no signs of slowing down. The streaming market size is projected to grow to $1.9 trillion by 2028, as noted by Fortune Business Insights. This remarkable growth is a testament to the profound impact streaming has had on our entertainment habits. In fact, if anything, the pace of change in streaming is only going to quicken, and the future is going to be even more exciting, going by some of the emerging trends and technologies on the horizon.Exponential advances in technology have changed entire industries, especially over the past 10 to 15 years. For example, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Prime Video, Hulu, and other digital channels or streaming services have acted as massive disruptive forces within the media and television industries. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) maintains a strong competitive edge compared to legacy media giants, as switching to streaming services for entertainment becomes more dominant. Netflix has demonstrated outstanding financial performance, with a return of 31.00% year-to-date (YTD) and 63.09% in the last 12 months. Over the past 10 years, the company had an annualized return of 24.58%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 benchmark, which had an annualized return of 9.99% during the same period.On the other hand, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has faced challenges in its financial performance, with a return of -4.97% year-to-date (YTD) and -20.99% in the last 12 months. Over the past 10 years, The Walt Disney Company had an annualized return of 3.45%, underperforming the S&amp;P500 index.Story continuesIn July 2023, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s CEO Bob Iger extended his contract through 2026, acknowledging the challenges ahead. Iger's concern about Disney's TV networks, which he suggested may not be central to Disney's core, highlights the industry's shifting priorities. The battle for supremacy in streaming and content distribution will undoubtedly persist, with Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) at the forefront of innovation and adaptation.Ensemble Capital Management shared a noteworthy observation about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in their Q2, 2023 investor letter: “Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) (+27.5%): Netflix posted a great quarter supported by a positive response to its password sharing crackdown and advertising-supported service rollout. In addition, some of its major competitors have been struggling, including Disney+ which lost subscribers in the first quarter for the first time in its history.”In the second quarter of 2023, Polen Focus Growth Strategy also turned its attention to stocks like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), further emphasizing the streaming giant's prominence in the investment landscape. In their Q2, 2023 investor letter, Polen Focus Growth Strategy provided the following insight regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX): ""The top absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance in the second quarter were Amazon, Netflix, and Microsoft. As mentioned, Amazon and Netflix are seeing their revenue growth accelerate after a difficult 2022 while keeping expense growth in check. We expect robust earnings growth for both companies in 2023 and growth rates in the mid-teens or higher well into the future.”The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s CEO Bob Iger has also been actively discussing his strategy to bring Disney+ to profitability in recent earnings calls and interviews. A notable component of this plan is the integration of advertising within the Disney+ platform. Recognizing the need to evolve in the competitive streaming landscape, Iger's emphasis on advertising reflects Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s commitment to adapt and thrive in the evolving market.Investor attention is now shifting toward legacy media companies like Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), all of which possess significant pay-TV network portfolios. Bob Iger's recent statement that traditional TV may not align with Disney's core strategy has put these companies in the spotlight, with investors closely monitoring their responses, including the potential consideration of a sale, in the face of a rapidly changing media landscape.In light of the most recent news and industry trends, it's time to uncover the 12 best streaming and TV stocks to buy now.12 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy NowCopyright: lculig / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyTo compile our list of 12 best streaming and TV stocks, we first made a list of all streaming and TV companies in the US.

Shares tumbled following a lackluster earnings report and subsequent dividend cut, presenting an attractive entry point in this leading entertainment company. PARA’s Filmed Entertainment business has an exciting upcoming 2023 and 2024 movie slate with many high-profile franchises. Its TV Media segment is undergoing a restructuring to save on costs and PARA’s fresh array of global content is driving subscriber momentum worldwide across its direct-to-consumer platform. Meanwhile, management is magnifying its focus on profitability for the streaming service and moderating investments in content, which should drive free cash flow in 2024 and beyond. In our view, the company’s long-term opportunity in streaming and the value of its proprietary content remain meaningfully underappreciated at current trading levels.”7. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)Number of Hedge Funds In Q2 2023: 66Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), an American multinational telecommunications and media conglomerate, holds the distinction of being the largest pay-TV company, the largest cable TV company, and the largest home Internet service provider in the United States.On August 9, 2023, Argus Research, a notable financial analysis firm, issued an updated price target for Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA). Argus Research analyst Joseph Bonner, in light of his evaluation, reiterated a ""Buy"" rating for Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and raised the price target from $45 to $50. This adjustment in the price target indicates a more optimistic outlook for the company's performance.

Among these, First Eagle Investment Management was a prominent fund, holding a total of 32,452,337 shares. The hedge fund sentiment reflects that Comcast is one of the best tv and streaming stocks.6. Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD)Number of Hedge Funds In Q2 2023: 67On August 8, 2023, Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar made adjustments to their evaluation of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD). The analyst raised the price target on Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) from $14 to $15 while maintaining their ""Hold"" rating on the stock. Venkateshwar's analysis was based on Warner Bros. Discovery's Q2 2023 earnings, which were reported on August 3, 2023. In his evaluation, he placed particular emphasis on the company's top-line performance. The analyst acknowledged that licensing revenues had contributed positively to the quarter's results, but he also highlighted the ongoing challenges faced by core media trends. Looking ahead to streaming growth for FY 2024, Venkateshwar expressed the view that it hinges on the success of implementing sharp price increases as normalized content and marketing investments decrease.Looking ahead, Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD)'s management provided guidance for the third quarter of 2023, anticipating adjusted EBITDA in the range of the low end of $11 billion to $11.5 billion, accompanied by free cash flow estimated at $1.7 billion. Additionally, for the fiscal year 2023, the company expects adjusted EBITDA to be ""U.S. DTC profitable"" and segment losses to amount to a couple of hundred million dollars. Furthermore, the company anticipates free cash flow ranging from $4.5 billion to $5.0 billion for the full year.As of Q2 2023, a total of 67 funds among the 910 tracked by us had invested in Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD). This data reflects a significant level of institutional interest in the company, underscoring its prominence within the investment landscape.Moreover, the Longleaf Partners Fund provided the following commentary regarding Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD) in its investor letter for the second quarter of 2023:“Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) – Media conglomerate Warner Bros Discovery was the top detractor in the quarter but remained a top contributor for the first half. After a strong first quarter, the stock price faltered in the face of near-term uncertainty around the re-launch of streaming service Max. Additionally, the big budget movie The Flash has not been a success. Finally, there was well-publicized drama around CNN management, with CNN CEO Chris Licht leaving the company after only one year, which we believe was a positive resolution. The company remains dramatically undervalued today, and management continues to make positive operational progress to drive free cash flow (FCF) growth. We believe this company has seen the worst so will be less leveraged and more strategically positioned in the quarters and years to come. Its underlying holdings are high quality businesses that will drive FCF per share growth while also being attractive acquisition candidates.”Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy Now.Suggested Articles:10 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside14 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now11 Crypto Stocks with Biggest Upside Disclosure: None. 12 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

241,a9aec124-af72-3bde-b407-a2d348d12775,DIS,2023-09-23,Rupert Murdoch isn’t going anywhere just yet,The Economist,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rupert-murdoch-isn-t-going-194454524.html,1695411894,STORY,"['FOXA', 'DIS']","[“TO WALK AWAY and retire, it’s a pretty dismal prospect,” Rupert Murdoch told an interviewer in 1998, when he was already well into pensionable age. If he ever did stop working, he added, he would “die pretty quickly”.So the announcement on September 21st that the 92-year-old is stepping down as chairman of Fox Corporation and News Corp, the television and newspaper empires he has built up over more than 70 years, should be treated with some scepticism. Mr Murdoch will stay on as “chairman emeritus” and says he will remain “involved every day in the contest of ideas”. This week he advised staff: “When I visit your countries and companies, you can expect to see me in the office late on a Friday.” It was both a promise and a warning.The handover of Mr Murdoch’s empire has been a gradual process. He has shied away from earnings calls since the sale of 21st Century Fox, the bulk of his film and TV assets, to Disney in 2019. The question of succession was in effect settled the following year, when James Murdoch, the younger son and sometime heir apparent, left the News Corp board, citing “disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions”. This left the path clear for Mr Murdoch’s elder son, Lachlan, who will take over from his father at the two family firms.Why the change in titles now? Mr Murdoch said in his letter to staff this week that he was in robust health. But investors have recently begun to question those assurances. Vanity Fair reported in April that he had quietly suffered a series of health problems including a broken back, seizures and two bouts of pneumonia. His testimony in a recent legal case against Fox brought by Dominion Voting Systems, which accused the company of damaging its reputation, seemed to lack some of the mogul’s old sharpness.These concerns have coincided with a series of missteps. Fox pursued a calamitous legal strategy in the Dominion case, eventually paying up nearly $800m to settle it. (A related case brought by another voting-technology company, Smartmatic, is expected to go to trial in 2025; Smartmatic is seeking $2.7bn.) It has suffered public spats with some of its anchors, including Tucker Carlson, who was jettisoned in April and has since set himself up on the social network formerly known as Twitter. And an attempt by Mr Murdoch to unify his two companies earlier this year was shot down by shareholders.Story continuesThose investors may be reassured by Mr Murdoch’s more modest new title. In recent years analysts have come to speak of a “Murdoch discount” applied to Fox and News Corp. Mr Murdoch’s new title means that “his interface with the public markets is over,” says Claire Enders, a media analyst. “But it is obvious that he is the ultimate decision-maker as long as he is alive.”That is reflected nowhere so clearly as his choice of successor. Mr Murdoch set up a decades-long audition between three of his children: Elisabeth, Lachlan and James (his eldest child, Prudence, has mostly stayed away from the company; his two youngest children by another marriage, Grace and Chloe, are still in their early 20s). Though it was James who set up the auction of 21st Century Fox, selling to Disney at the top of the market for $71bn, the job has gone to Lachlan, the child who gets on best with his father. Whereas James and Elisabeth have both criticised the political positions of their father’s companies, Lachlan appears to share the elder Murdoch’s politics. Any changes are likely to be minor: perhaps a little more focus on streaming (Tubi, Fox’s advertising-supported streamer, is performing well) and less on British news media (TalkTV, a recent venture there, has not been a big hit so far).When Murdoch père eventually dies, things may change more. Control of the family trust, which ultimately holds sway over both companies, will pass to the four eldest siblings. The newspaper and television industries are both going through a bumpy digital transition, opening up new possibilities. Assets such as Fox News could be changed, or sold off, when the next generation takes control. But it may be a while before that happens. Mr Murdoch’s mother lived to be 103. One person close to the family, asked what will happen when Mr Murdoch passes, reports simply: “He insists he won’t.”© 2023 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

Born in London to Murdoch and his second wife, Anna, he grew up steeped in the media business. In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s “Dynasties” program, he said that every morning, before catching the school bus, he and his siblings would read the morning papers - The New York Post, The New York Times, the Daily News and the Wall Street Journal - with his father flagging stories of interest, ordering: “Read that.”The best way to capture their father’s attention in the evenings was to talk about media or politics, according to Paddy Manning’s 2022 biography, “The Successor.” As Lachlan Murdoch got older, he would spend summers working in the family business, cleaning the presses for Sydney’s “Daily Mirror,” or working as a cub reporter for the “San Antonio Express-News.”A rivalry between Lachlan and his younger brother, James, played out from an early age, where even family Monopoly games “were intense and everybody was prepared to cheat,” according to one published account.Lachlan Murdoch and his siblings attended Dalton, a private school on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, and other elite schools, including Trinity School, where he formed the Trinity Conservative Society, “In an attempt to create a healthy balance between all points of view,” according to one yearbook entry cited by Manning.Story continuesAfter graduating in 1994 from Princeton, where he majored in philosophy, he entered the family business, spending three years in Australia, ascending the corporate ladder to become chairman of News Limited.In 1999, Lachlan Murdoch assumed responsibility for print operations in the U.S. He rose to deputy chief operating officer at News Corp, overseeing the company’s U.S. television stations group and publishing assets, including the New York Post. Many saw him as being trained to assume the corporate reins as his father’s successor.He abruptly resigned in 2005, creating questions about who would succeed Rupert Murdoch at the helm of the media empire he had assembled from a single newspaper in Australia. Lachlan Murdoch founded Illyria Pty, a private investment company, whose acquisitions included a network of Australian radio stations. In 2015, he returned to the family business, sharing the title of co-chairman of 21st Century Fox with his brother, James.The sale of Fox’s entertainment assets to Walt Disney in 2019, in a $71-billion transaction, shrank the size of the Murdochs’ once-vast media holdings. The newly constituted Fox was reduced to a handful of assets, including the Fox broadcast network, Fox News, Fox Sports and Fox Business, with Lachlan Murdoch serving as its executive chair and chief executive officer.Brother James Murdoch left Fox with the close of the Disney transaction.As chief executive of Fox Corp since 2019, Lachlan Murdoch has presided over the media properties during seismic change in the industry, as viewers cut their cable subscriptions in favor of streaming services. Even so, Fox News has largely maintained its rating dominance, in part because of its appeal among politically conservative-leaning American viewers.Lachlan Murdoch doesn’t speak publicly about his politics, according to an article in the New York Times magazine, which cited the 2016 memoir ""Making Headlines,"" by Chris Mitchell, the longtime editor of The Australian, as describing “Lachlan’s conservatism is more vigorous than that of any Australian politician” and that his views were usually to the right of his father’s.A Fox spokesperson called that ""just speculation,"" adding ""I wouldn't want to put a label on him, but it wouldn't be unfair to categorize him as a conservative.""Fox’s loyalty to those viewers became a hot-button issue during discovery for Dominion Voting Systems’ lawsuit against Fox, in which the voting technology firm claimed that Fox perpetuated falsehoods about its voting machines in an effort to appease the network’s base of supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump. Fox settled the lawsuit for $787.5 million in April, avoiding a trial in which Lachlan and his father were expected to testify.In public remarks in the weeks following the settlement, Lachlan said that Fox had been acting as a news organization reporting on the newsworthy events of the day, and recommitted to Fox’s programming strategy.While Rupert Murdoch built his legacy pursuing the television, movie and newspaper businesses with equal abandon, Lachlan’s legacy is still taking shape. In calls with investors, he often becomes animated when speaking about Tubi, an ad-supported streaming service that the company acquired for $440 million in 2020, and which is now valued at $3 billion.Lachlan Murdoch's family lives in Sydney, Australia, and he travels to Los Angeles, where Fox is based and they also maintain a home.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles and Helen Coster in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Nick Zieminski)]"
243,bc5bb118-bd31-393c-b385-b0857e0a90b1,DIS,2023-09-23,Rupert Murdoch is retiring. Here’s a look into the real-life succession drama that roiled his family and inspired a hit HBO show,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rupert-murdoch-retiring-look-real-174113370.html,1695404473,STORY,"['NWSA', 'FOXA', 'DIS']","[Spoiler alert: The withering patriarch of Succession, Logan Roy, never stepped down as CEO of a media conglomerate before passing away, nor did he nail down a succession plan. But the real-life Logan Roy just did. Business magnate and media mogul Rupert Murdoch, 92, announced on Thursday that he’s retiring as chairman at Fox Corporation and News Corp. in mid-November after a seven-decade career.Despite the HBO drama creator Jesse Armstrong’s reminders that the characters are fictional and “no one family unlocks” them, the Roys have an uncanny resemblance to the Murdochs—a powerful, aging media executive who watches his children vie for control of the empire. Sound familiar? The similarities are apparent enough that Rupert Murdoch barred his ex-wife Jerry Hall from giving story ideas to Succession writers in their divorce settlement.Logan Roy, played by Brian Cox, is widely thought to be a composite of Murdoch and another media baron, the deceased Sumner Redstone, whose real-life story is even more dramatic than any HBO show, as captured in the recent book Unscripted (on which a new TV series may soon be based). But it’s the laundry list of similarities between Murdoch and the Waystar Royco CEO that makes them the closest analogues—from their foreign origins and numerous health scares, speeches atop printer paper podiums, multiple marriages and divorces, and, of course, pitting their children against each other while encouraging them to compete to be anointed as successor.The rivalry between Roman and Kendall Roy bears a striking resemblance to Lachlan and James Murdoch. Here’s a look at the Fox News succession—and who came out on top.Lachlan and JamesAlthough it’s been clear for a while, now it’s official: Murdoch said on Thursday that he’s handing the reins to his 52-year-old son Lachlan, who will become the sole chair of News Corp. and continue as executive chair and CEO of Fox Corporation.Lachlan, his older sister Elisabeth, and younger brother James have long been contenders for the top job. But Lachlan has seemingly always been Rupert’s “number-one boy” and the preferred choice to succeed him, Vanity Fair reported in May. Murdoch has suggested as much:Story continues""Currently it is their consensus that Lachlan will take over,"" Murdoch said in a 1997 interview, as reported by The Guardian. ""He will be the first among equals, but they will all have to prove themselves.""At first glance, Lachlan draws obvious comparisons to Kendall. Both are eldest sons who have been groomed to take over the family business one day. But in terms of personality, Lachlan more closely resembles Roman, the snarky, impulsive younger brother portrayed by Kieran Culkin.In 2005, Lachlan had a dispute with then-boss of Fox News, Roger Ailes—the same Ailes who was later sued by Fox host Gretchen Carlson for sexual harassment, which the movie Bombshell (featuring Margot Robbie and Nicole Kidman) was based. Lachlan quit his role as deputy COO of News Corp. and moved to Australia. He returned to the states nearly 10 years later at his father’s behest, agreeing to be his heir.But during Lachlan’s decade overseas, his younger brother, the now 50-year-old James, became the heir apparent. James spent those years climbing through the ranks, ensuring the longevity and respect of his father’s media empire by making deals with the likes of Hulu and National Geographic Channel and promising that News Corp. would go carbon neutral. His father bringing Lachlan back was like a “big slap in the face” to the younger brother, a source told Vanity Fair.James resembles Kendall in that he was known as “the smart one” and has been baited by his father for the top job for decades. James has served in high-ranking roles in News Corp. and even did a stint in Hong Kong, reminiscent of Kendall’s time in Shanghai. Jeremy Strong, the actor who portrays Kendall, told The New Yorker that he used details about James to prepare for the role.Disney and DominionIn August 2017, Murdoch and Disney CEO Bob Iger discussed selling 21st Century Fox’s assets to Disney. Lachlan and James clashed over the deal—Lachlan felt that his father and brother were rushing to sell his future empire out from underneath him, while James thought it was a good business opportunity, according to Vanity Fair. Not to mention, James was in talks with Iger to take a high-level position at Disney post-acquisition, the outlet reported.The deal went through. Disney acquired the 21st Century Fox movie and television studios for more than $52 billion in March 2019. Lachlan was left to run what remained—Fox News and the remaining assets—and James took his money and left to start a media fund called Lupa Systems. (The word lupa is Italian for “she-wolf,” like the one that raised the founding brothers of Rome—Romulus and Remus—before Romulus murdered Remus, Vanity Fair noted.)Then Fox News got involved with Trump. In 2020, Murdoch’s right-wing news network became the town crier of theories that the presidential election was stolen, asserting that voting machines owned by Dominion Voting Systems switched Americans’ votes to Biden after they’d voted for Trump. In response, Dominion brought a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit in March 2021 against Fox News, claiming that Murdoch protected Fox’s ratings by allowing hosts and guests to perpetuate the conspiracy. Two years later, Fox agreed to pay Dominion a $787 million settlement, and Fox host Tucker Carlson was fired.Elisabeth and PrudenceThe Succession inspirations go beyond Lachlan and James. Elisabeth is comparable to Siobhan (better known as Shiv), the sharp and poised daughter who originally pursued a career outside of her father’s empire and could run the company just as well if only she weren’t a woman in an ultra-conservative, male-dominated industry. Meanwhile, Prudence Murdoch resembles Connor Roy as she is the only child from the patriarch’s first marriage and is often considered the forgotten sibling.Lachlan and James don’t talk anymore. James has distanced himself from Fox News for its climate denialism, white nationalism, and election conspiracies. And now that Lachlan holds the keys to the kingdom, James is biding his time to oust his brother with the help of their sisters, Elisabeth and Prudence, once their father is gone, sources told Vanity Fair.People close to the Murdochs weren’t sure what James would do with Fox if he managed to win it back, but they assumed that he’d completely overhaul the organization or sell it off to the highest bidder.“James sees destroying Fox News as his mission in life,” a senior Fox staffer told Vanity Fair.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Colgate-Palmolive:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.29 = US$3.4b ÷ (US$16b - US$4.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Colgate-Palmolive has an ROCE of 29%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Household Products industry average of 15%. View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Colgate-Palmolive compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Colgate-Palmolive here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEIn terms of Colgate-Palmolive's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 45%, but they have dropped over the last five years. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesOur Take On Colgate-Palmolive's ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Colgate-Palmolive's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. And with the stock having returned a mere 22% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere.One more thing to note, we've identified   3 warning signs  with Colgate-Palmolive and understanding these should be part of your investment process.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the streaming industry and recent trends shaping the streaming market, go directly to 5 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy Now. Streaming has become an integral part of our daily lives, from watching movies and TV shows to listening to music and playing games. The rise of streaming services has been incredible, and there are no signs of slowing down. The streaming market size is projected to grow to $1.9 trillion by 2028, as noted by Fortune Business Insights. This remarkable growth is a testament to the profound impact streaming has had on our entertainment habits. In fact, if anything, the pace of change in streaming is only going to quicken, and the future is going to be even more exciting, going by some of the emerging trends and technologies on the horizon.Exponential advances in technology have changed entire industries, especially over the past 10 to 15 years. For example, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Prime Video, Hulu, and other digital channels or streaming services have acted as massive disruptive forces within the media and television industries. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) maintains a strong competitive edge compared to legacy media giants, as switching to streaming services for entertainment becomes more dominant. Netflix has demonstrated outstanding financial performance, with a return of 31.00% year-to-date (YTD) and 63.09% in the last 12 months. Over the past 10 years, the company had an annualized return of 24.58%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 benchmark, which had an annualized return of 9.99% during the same period.On the other hand, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has faced challenges in its financial performance, with a return of -4.97% year-to-date (YTD) and -20.99% in the last 12 months. Over the past 10 years, The Walt Disney Company had an annualized return of 3.45%, underperforming the S&amp;P500 index.Story continuesIn July 2023, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s CEO Bob Iger extended his contract through 2026, acknowledging the challenges ahead. Iger's concern about Disney's TV networks, which he suggested may not be central to Disney's core, highlights the industry's shifting priorities. The battle for supremacy in streaming and content distribution will undoubtedly persist, with Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) at the forefront of innovation and adaptation.Ensemble Capital Management shared a noteworthy observation about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in their Q2, 2023 investor letter: “Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) (+27.5%): Netflix posted a great quarter supported by a positive response to its password sharing crackdown and advertising-supported service rollout. In addition, some of its major competitors have been struggling, including Disney+ which lost subscribers in the first quarter for the first time in its history.”In the second quarter of 2023, Polen Focus Growth Strategy also turned its attention to stocks like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), further emphasizing the streaming giant's prominence in the investment landscape. In their Q2, 2023 investor letter, Polen Focus Growth Strategy provided the following insight regarding Netflix, Inc.

PARA’s Filmed Entertainment business has an exciting upcoming 2023 and 2024 movie slate with many high-profile franchises. Its TV Media segment is undergoing a restructuring to save on costs and PARA’s fresh array of global content is driving subscriber momentum worldwide across its direct-to-consumer platform. Meanwhile, management is magnifying its focus on profitability for the streaming service and moderating investments in content, which should drive free cash flow in 2024 and beyond. In our view, the company’s long-term opportunity in streaming and the value of its proprietary content remain meaningfully underappreciated at current trading levels.”7.

Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD). The analyst raised the price target on Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) from $14 to $15 while maintaining their ""Hold"" rating on the stock. Venkateshwar's analysis was based on Warner Bros. Discovery's Q2 2023 earnings, which were reported on August 3, 2023. In his evaluation, he placed particular emphasis on the company's top-line performance. The analyst acknowledged that licensing revenues had contributed positively to the quarter's results, but he also highlighted the ongoing challenges faced by core media trends. Looking ahead to streaming growth for FY 2024, Venkateshwar expressed the view that it hinges on the success of implementing sharp price increases as normalized content and marketing investments decrease.Looking ahead, Warner Bros.

Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD) in its investor letter for the second quarter of 2023:“Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) – Media conglomerate Warner Bros Discovery was the top detractor in the quarter but remained a top contributor for the first half. After a strong first quarter, the stock price faltered in the face of near-term uncertainty around the re-launch of streaming service Max. Additionally, the big budget movie The Flash has not been a success. Finally, there was well-publicized drama around CNN management, with CNN CEO Chris Licht leaving the company after only one year, which we believe was a positive resolution. The company remains dramatically undervalued today, and management continues to make positive operational progress to drive free cash flow (FCF) growth. We believe this company has seen the worst so will be less leveraged and more strategically positioned in the quarters and years to come. Its underlying holdings are high quality businesses that will drive FCF per share growth while also being attractive acquisition candidates.”Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy Now.Suggested Articles:10 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside14 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now11 Crypto Stocks with Biggest Upside Disclosure: None. 12 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.4% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, to which Devon Energy belongs, has lost 5.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.44 per share, indicating a change of -33.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.60 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -32.6%. This estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.57 indicates a change of +17.3% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Devon Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.97 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -26.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $15.29 billion and $16.12 billion estimates indicate -20.3% and +5.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $3.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -38.6%. EPS of $1.18 for the same period compares with $2.59 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -9.23%. The EPS surprise was +0.85%.Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

YUM is experiencing strong same-store sales growth, successful expansion initiatives and a thriving digital transformation, all of which are contributing positively to its performance. As a result, the stock has seen a 12.7% rise over the past year, outperforming the industry's 11% growth. Nonetheless, YUM continues to grapple with elevated cost-related challenges.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 12.6%. In the past 60 days, earnings estimate for 2023 has witnessed upward revision of 2.4% to $5.19 per share. The company’s earnings and sales in 2023 are likely to witness improvements of 15.1% and 5.9% year over year, respectively.Factors Driving GrowthDespite the challenging macro environment, YUM impressed investors with robust same-store sales growth in second-quarter 2023. It reported consolidated same-store sales growth of 9% year over year. The upside was primarily backed by a rise in dine-in traffic, digital initiatives and strategic third-party partnerships.During the quarter, same-store sales at Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut rose 4%, 13% and 4% year over year, respectively. YUM has been benefiting from a recovery in emerging markets. Given its focus on consumer value proposition, expanded digital access and franchise partners, management anticipates the momentum to continue in the upcoming periods.The company is also benefiting from strong expansion efforts. Considering its existing footprint of 55,361 restaurants worldwide, YUM! Brands believes it can roughly triple its current global presence over the long term.Yum! Brands implemented various digital features in mobile and online platforms across all brand segments to enhance guest experience. It has been working toward accelerating its delivery services and the results have been positive so far. In second-quarter 2023, it reported digital sales of approximately $7 billion.Moreover, YUM reported solid adoption of Dragontail Systems. The initiative paves a path to tap the powers of artificial intelligence to streamline the end-to-end food preparation process as well as improve its delivery capabilities. The company expanded its global adoption of the platform to 28 markets across both KFC and Pizza Hut brands.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConcernsAn increase in the cost of employee wages, benefits and insurance, and other operating expenses such as rent and energy expenditures put significant pressure on the company’s margins. A competitive retail environment weighed on the restaurants’ costs. YUM is susceptible to profit margin pressure due to relentless expansion.In second-quarter 2023, its net costs and expenses amounted to $1,114 million compared with $1,082 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The transfer of business and exit from Russia incorporated certain additional costs, which hurt its margins. Expenses associated with brand positioning in all key markets and ongoing investment initiatives are likely to weigh on margins in the near term.Management remains cautious of the uncertain macro environment.

This move is part of a series of transactions made by the insider over the past year, which saw a total of 17,948 shares sold and no shares purchased.MCD 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MCDJoseph Erlinger has been with McDonald's Corp for several years, serving in various leadership roles before his current position as President of McDonald's USA. His insider trading activities provide valuable insights into the company's financial health and future prospects.McDonald's Corp is a leading global foodservice retailer with over 36,000 locations in more than 100 countries. The company operates and franchises McDonald's restaurants, which serve a locally-relevant menu of quality food and beverages sold at various price points.The insider's recent sell-off could be interpreted in several ways. It might indicate a lack of confidence in the company's future performance, or it could simply be a personal financial decision. To gain a clearer understanding, it's essential to analyze the insider's trading activities in relation to the company's stock price.Insider Sell: McDonald's USA President Joseph Erlinger Sells 4,487 SharesThe insider transaction history for McDonald's Corp shows a trend of more sells than buys over the past year. There have been 15 insider sells and only 1 insider buy during this period. This could suggest that insiders believe the company's stock is currently overvalued, prompting them to sell their shares.On the day of the insider's recent sell, McDonald's Corp shares were trading at $271.26 each, giving the company a market cap of $198.38 billion. The price-earnings ratio was 25.04, higher than both the industry median of 23.86 and the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. This suggests that the stock might be overpriced.Insider Sell: McDonald's USA President Joseph Erlinger Sells 4,487 SharesHowever, according to the GuruFocus Value, which is an intrinsic value estimate based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates, McDonald's Corp is fairly valued. With a price of $271.26 and a GuruFocus Value of $285.17, the stock has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.95.In conclusion, while the insider's recent sell-off might raise some eyebrows, the company's valuation metrics suggest that the stock is fairly valued. Investors should keep a close eye on further insider trading activities and other market indicators to make informed investment decisions.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Around 95% of these were operated by franchisees as of Dec. 31, making up nearly 30% of the company's total revenue in 2022.Average cash flows for these U.S. franchisees have grown more than 35% over the past five years, the letter showed.The company will also change the term for payments from ""service fees"" to ""royalty fees"", used by all other McDonald's markets around the world.Royalty is a fee paid by restaurant operators to the owner and the rate is set based on the revenue generated by the licensed property.(Reporting by Savyata Mishra and Ananya Mariam Rajesh; additonal reporting by Granth Vanaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)]"

Photo: Erika KapinIt began with a demonstration. Tens of thousands of people marched through Midtown Manhattan on Sunday, Sept. 17, calling on world leaders to usher in the end of fossil fuels ahead of the United Nations’ Climate Ambition Summit.The opening ceremony of Climate Week NYC took place simultaneously across town, kicking off a singularly industrious and gridlocked week in New York City. The official Climate Week calendar contained more than 400 events this year — and, for the uninitiated, there is now a 2-year-old free mobile app that helps participants browse the offerings and design a personal schedule.It feels like this is the “year of contradictions,” said Helen Clarkson, CEO of the nonprofit Climate Group, in her opening address at the Times Center at 242 West 41st Street. “We’re living through a solar boom, but this year Canada’s forests were reduced to ashes, forcing people right here in New York to stay indoors.“So yes, we can,” she said. “—but will we?”When it comes to reducing carbon emissions from commercial buildings — a key component to any mass environmental effort — 2023 marks a pivot from goal-setting to implementation. It’s what Clarkson called the “messy middle” of the energy transition.Advances in data collection and the consolidation of reporting standards are making it easier for property managers to jump on the net-zero bandwagon. But value creation remains a prerequisite for investors and financial services providers to make sustainability a part of their investment strategy.A survey of 300 real estate companies conducted this year by British bank HSBC revealed that lenders remain the gatekeepers of climate innovation to a surprising degree. Forty percent of respondents said that access to finance is the No. 1 barrier to improving their real estate portfolio’s sustainability.And, in the office sector, demand for space in low-carbon buildings is on track to outstrip supply by 75 percent across all major markets in the United States by 2030, JLL (JLL) researchers found in a report released during Climate Week.Story continuesThe new premium for sustainable office leases has begun to rear its head in London and Paris, Guy Grainger, JLL’s global head of sustainability services and ESG, noted in an analysis of the findings.Corporate tenants have the most to gain, Grainger wrote, because they know “leasing low-carbon spaces and decarbonizing their real estate operations are easier wins compared to tackling Scope 3 emissions across their supply chains.”Industrial owner Prologis (PLD) blazed a new path in 2018 when it proffered its letter of commitment to the Science Based Targets initiative, a nonprofit advisory group that validates private sector emissions reduction targets using standards set by the 2015 Paris Agreement. In doing so, Prologis became the largest industrial real estate investment trust to set a specific emissions target.Prologis updated that target last year, setting a net-zero goal across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2040. The emissions accounting categories cover all sources produced by a company directly, indirectly, and as a result of all of the assets it owns.“Now this is when all the work starts,” said Suzanne Fallender, vice president of ESG at Prologis, who was a panelist at JLL’s “Finance, Real Estate &amp; Sustainability” event at 320 Park Avenue on Monday. “It touches every part of the company.”She said the company’s current focus is building solar capacity sufficient to generate 1 gigawatt of electricity by 2025. That means putting a solar-ready roof and electric vehicle hookups on every new development.“Our investment strategy is that sustainability and climate risk can be material to the financial performance of real estate,” said LaSalle Investment Management’s sustainability head Elena Alschuler, also a panelist at the JLL event.At panels and networking events across the city, commercial real estate’s sustainability leaders showed little reticence about getting into the nitty-gritty of the Inflation Reduction Act and other public funding opportunities at the state and local level.One of the first projects selected to participate in the Empire Building Challenge’s low-carbon public-private design partnership is underway at 345 Hudson in Hudson Square: a 1931 commercial office building adjacent to Hines’ state-of-the-art carbon-neutral office tower at 555 Greenwich. Serpentine tubes run through the building’s floor slabs and transfer warmth from deep underground using technology developed in Norway and Sweden.A $5 million investment from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) will go toward developing a hydronic loop between the two properties and ultimately ween the older building off fossil fuel heating.Getting tenants and landlords to align their goals is still the perennial challenge. It’s been one of Michael Reed’s chief preoccupations during his six years as NYSERDA’s head of advanced energy solutions.“There’s nothing new under the sun,” Reed said at a panel hosted by Hines in a sun-drenched cement amphitheater on the ground floor of 555 Greenwich on Wednesday. “The split incentive has existed for a very long time. What’s changing is the imperative.”The next day, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced New York will commit to quadrupling heat pump installations by 2030 on behalf of the U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition of 25 governors targeting 20 million heat pump installations across the United States in the same time frame.“I’m not sure that we’re at the point where you can sort of use a program or come up with a menu of items to get you to where you need to go,” said Ben Rodney, Hines’ vice president of construction in the east region. “For owners that don’t have the same access to capital, having software to come up with solutions at a lower price point and faster, I think, is going to be extremely critical.“It’ll be interesting to see which sort of companies become the winners in this space in the coming years.”Abigail Nehring can be reached at anehring@commercialobserver.com.Trending Commercial Observer StoriesLong Island City, Woodside Eyed for Rezonings in Western QueensPower Proptech 2023Fintech Firm Revolut Signs 10K-SF Lease at 107 GreenwichWhy the Federal Government Can't Shake Its Empty Office SpaceProperty Management Startup Propify Closes $3.3M Seed Funding RoundRead the original story Climate Week NYC This Year Was More About Action Than Talk and others by Abigail Nehring at Commercial Observer.]"

As a prominent player in this asset class, the company is experiencing robust demand for its industrial real estate offerings, as evidenced by the strong performance in leasing, rental rates and property occupancy levels.Due to the surge in e-commerce, the expansion of various industries and continuous endeavors to enhance supply-chain effectiveness, there has been a notable increase in the need for logistics infrastructure and streamlined distribution networks. This upswing is contributing to the thriving state of the industrial real estate market, which is proving advantageous for companies like Prologis, STAG Industrial STAG and First Industrial Realty Trust FR.The future of supply chains hinges on their ability to remain resilient. Consequently, in the long run, apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, logistics real estate is expected to benefit from an increase in inventory levels. This opens up opportunities for industrial property owners, including Prologis, STAG Industrial and First Industrial Realty, to thrive in a favorable market environment.In particular, PLD provides industrial distribution warehouse space in some of the busiest distribution markets worldwide. The properties of the company are typically located in large, supply-constrained infill markets in close proximity to airports, seaports and ground transportation facilities, which facilitates the rapid distribution of customers’ products. The solid demand for Prologis’ strategically located facilities has driven healthy operating performance over the past few quarters.In the second quarter of 2023, 43.3 million square feet (msf) of leases commenced in the company’s owned and managed portfolio, with 38.4 msf in the operating portfolio and 4.9 msf in the development portfolio. The average occupancy level in Prologis’ owned and managed portfolio remained high at 97.5%.For 2023, management expects occupancy in the band of 97.0-97.5%. We estimate the metric to be 97.1%. Also, our estimate points to a year-over-year increase of 36% in rental revenues in the current year.With healthy operating fundamentals in industrial real estate markets, Prologis has capitalized on growth opportunities through acquisitions and developments. Its investments over the years comprise a wide array, including the largest M&amp;A transactions in the real estate sector and individual off-market deals below $5 million.In June 2023, it concluded the buyout of nearly 14 million square feet of industrial properties from opportunistic real estate funds affiliated with Blackstone for cash consideration of $3.1 billion. The move significantly enhanced Prologis’ presence in the key U.S. markets, poising it well for long-term growth. Last year, PLD closed the acquisition of Duke Realty, thereby boosting its presence in the key markets of the United States.In the first half of 2023, the company’s share of building acquisitions amounted to $172 million. Development stabilization aggregated $1.47 billion, while development starts totaled $411 million. For 2023, the company anticipates acquisitions at Prologis share between $300 and $600 million, while development starts are expected in the range of $2.5-$3 billion.PLD maintains a healthy balance sheet position with ample flexibility. This industrial REIT’s liquidity amounted to $6.4 billion in cash and availability on its credit facilities as of Jun 30, 2023. In addition, the company’s credit ratings as of Jun 30, 2023 were A3 (Outlook Stable) from Moody’s and A (Outlook Stable) from Standard &amp; Poor’s, enabling the company to borrow at an advantageous rate. Given its balance sheet strength and prudent financial management, the company is well-poised to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and Prologis is committed to that. In the last five years, Prologis has increased its dividend five times, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 13.43%. Check Prologis’ dividend history here.Analysts seem bullish regarding PLD’s funds from operations (FFO) growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2023 FFO per share has been revised marginally upward over the past seven days to $5.59. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of this industrial REIT have rallied 5.5% over the past year against the industry’s decline of 10.0%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, with the asset category being attractive even during challenging times, there is a development boom in many markets. The high supply is likely to fuel competition and curb pricing power. New supply is likely to create pressure on vacancy levels and rent growth to some extent in the upcoming quarters. Furthermore, recovery in the industrial market has continued for long, and the growth of e-commerce sales is likely to stabilize to some extent in the upcoming quarters.Moreover, a high interest rate is a concern for Prologis. Elevated rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Further, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money-market accounts.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That's because the traditional ways people manage retirement may no longer provide enough income to meet expenses - and with people generally living longer, the principal retirement savings is exhausted far too early in the retirement period.Your parents' retirement investing plan won't cut it today.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas the current rate is much lower.The effect of this drop in rates is substantial: over 20 years, the change in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is over $1 million.Today's retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields - and the Social Security picture isn't too rosy either. Right now and for the near future, Social Security benefits are still being paid, but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksAs a replacement for low yielding Treasury bonds (and other bond options), we believe dividend-paying stocks from high quality companies offer low risk and stable, predictable income investors in retirement seek.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.One approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Axis Capital (AXS) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.44 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.05%. This compares to the Insurance - Property and Casualty industry's yield of 0.14% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.71%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 2.33%. Check Axis Capital (AXS) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Preferred Bank (PFBC) is paying out a dividend of $0.55 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.58% compared to the Banks - West industry's yield of 3.15% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 27.91% over the past year. Check Preferred Bank (PFBC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.87 per share, Prologis (PLD) has a dividend yield of 3.04%. This is compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.82% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 10.13%. Check Prologis (PLD) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?It is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market.An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.You may be thinking, ""I like this dividend strategy, but instead of investing in individual stocks, I'm going to find a dividend-focused mutual fund or ETF."" This approach can make sense, but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees, which may reduce your dividend gains or income, and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach. If you do wish to invest in a fund, do your research to find the best-quality dividend funds with the lowest fees.Bottom LineSeeking steady, consistent income through dividends can be a smart option for financial security in retirement, whether you invest in mutual funds, ETFs, or in dividend-paying stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In response to growing traveler demand for eco-friendly options, Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE) recently signed the Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Travel and Tourism. Moreover, the company's Open World™ social impact and sustainability strategy focuses on three key pillars: Inclusive Access, Economic Mobility, and a Prosperous Planet.One of the most notable achievements is the Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE)’s commitment to decarbonizing its operations and mitigating climate change impacts.

The company also benefits from rapid growth in alternative accommodations, vacation home rental, through VRBO. The main sources of revenue and profitability are from hotel and vacation home rental. Additionally Expedia has exposure to airline ticket sales and automobile rentals. Post the COVID-19 pandemic, Expedia’s debt has been reduced and share repurchase has resumed and we would expect a dividend to be reinstated.”The Era of Experiential TourismAfter sustainable tourism, we also see how experiential tourism is on the rise, as travelers seek out unique and authentic experiences that connect them with local cultures and destinations. This trend is being driven by a number of factors like the growing popularity of social media, the desire for more meaningful travel experiences, and the increasing availability of experiential tourism experiences.One way to see the rise of experiential tourism is in the popularity of online platforms for booking experiential tourism experiences.

278,7a4a7ad3-8d68-3229-b1f4-32f0e1145d89,TROW,2023-09-23,Is T. Rowe Price Diversified Mid-Cap Growth (PRDMX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-diversified-mid-110006296.html,1695380406,STORY,['TROW'],"[Mutual Fund Equity Report fund seekers should consider taking a look at T. Rowe Price Diversified Mid-Cap Growth (PRDMX). PRDMX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerT. Rowe Price is based in Baltimore, MD, and is the manager of PRDMX. Since T. Rowe Price Diversified Mid-Cap Growth made its debut in January of 2004, PRDMX has garnered more than $1 billion in assets. Donald J. Peters is the fund's current manager and has held that role since January of 2004.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 8.62%, and it sits in the top third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 4.74%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, PRDMX's standard deviation comes in at 19.99%, compared to the category average of 18.03%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 21.65% compared to the category average of 19.14%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 1.07, so it is likely going to be more volatile than the market at large. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&amp;P 500. The fund has produced a negative alpha over the past 5 years of -2.4, which shows that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesHoldingsInvestigating the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology, as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund, the focus is primarily on equities that are traded in the United States.The mutual fund currently has 75.68% of its holdings in stocks and it has 4.06% of assets in foreign securities. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:TechnologyRetail TradeServicesIndustrial CyclicalThis fund's turnover is about 48.8%, so the fund managers are making fewer trades than its comparable peers.ExpensesAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, PRDMX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.86% compared to the category average of 1.15%. PRDMX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $2,500, and each subsequent investment should be at least $100.Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.Bottom LineOverall, T. Rowe Price Diversified Mid-Cap Growth ( PRDMX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively strong performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, T. Rowe Price Diversified Mid-Cap Growth ( PRDMX ) looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.Your research on the Mutual Fund Equity Report segment doesn't have to stop here.

Autoworkers are still striking Ford (F), but the will not widen the scope of the strike because progress has been made in negotiations. The summer saw lots of labor activity, Hollywood actors and writers going on strike and Teamsters getting a new deal from United Parcel Service (UPS). Service Employees International Union President Mary Kay Henry says workers are saying ""enough is enough. You're doing better as a company, I need to do better as a working person in this country."" When asked if labor unions are being more active now because the labor market is so tight, Henry says it's a different conversation. Henry points out that workers are taking on economic risk when they go on strike. ""I think what is happening across the economy is workers are taking inspiration from each other,"" Henry says.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- It's such an interesting moment in time for the US labor market, Mary, because, yes, we can talk about these strikes in Detroit with autoworkers. But as you know, Mary, there are strikes going on across so many different kinds of companies and industries and sectors, so autoworkers but also airline pilots, UPS workers, Hollywood actors and writers. I know that's a lot of different sectors and industries and markets, Mary. But do you think there's any kind of unifying theme there that's some explanation of why we see this rise of organizing activity?MARY KAY HENRY: Absolutely. Companies are generating record profits. And they need to be invested in the workers that carried us through the pandemic, that are moving through extreme heat and continuing to make our airports run, as the service workers who do baggage handling and cabin cleaning do every day in our nation's airports.Starbucks workers are trying to organize and join a union because that's a very profitable company that needs to create a seat at the table and a voice on the job for those workers. And so I think the common thread between all these workers is enough is enough. You're doing better as a company. I need to be able to do better as a working person in this country and work hard for a living in one job where I can expect that my children are going to do better than I've done.Story continues- And Mary, would another reason though, also be that union leaders are looking at the labor market, and they see a sturdy labor market, low unemployment, sub-4%, and they think now is the time to strike because now they have leverage?MARY KAY HENRY: I actually think the conversation is different because working people have to take a huge economic risk to decide to go on strike, whether it's a tight labor market or a loose labor market. And I think what's happening across the economy is workers are taking inspiration from each other.Autoworkers got to see UPS workers threaten a strike and have a history-making contract. Hollywood and SAG-AFTRA workers are on strike, demanding more from Hollywood. And then the UAW workers join them. We have Kaiser Permanente workers who just set October 3 and 4 for their strike date from a major health care company along the West Coast. So workers understand that they deserve better. And they're standing up together to make it happen.]"

It's one of the earlier reports we'll count in our Q3 tally, with others such as Auto Zone and General Mills also reporting in recent days.FedEx exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 23% and posted year-over-year growth of more than 30%, with lower operating expenses helping drive the improvement. Quarterly revenue totaled $21.7 billion, a tick below expectations and slipping 6% from the year-ago period. Operating income climbed 25% from the year-ago period, with cost reductions and other key initiatives providing meaningful tailwinds. Still, it's worth noting that the company has touched on ongoing demand weakness, which negatively impacted the quarter's results.The company's DRIVE program has also been delivering benefits and is expected to continue; FedEx expects permanent cost reductions of $1.8 billion from the transformative program, again helping offset recent demand weakness and deliver improved profitability.The market reacted highly favorably to the print, with FDX shares seeing notable buying pressure following the release. A peer, United Parcel Service, also saw modest buying pressure in response to the results.Given the better-than-expected print, it raises a valid question – which company, FedEx or United Parcel Service, currently looks like a better buy? Let's take a closer look at a few characteristics of each. FedEx vs. United Parcel ServiceUPS, a current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), has seen its near-term earnings outlook shift negatively across all timeframes, with analysts in full agreement. On the contrary, FedEx is a current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), with positive revisions hitting the tape for its current and next fiscal years.Story continuesAnd when it comes to growth, FedEx is the clear winner – FDX's earnings are forecasted to climb 16% in its current year (FY24) and an additional 22% in FY25, whereas United Parcel Service's earnings are forecasted to take a 27% hit in its current year before returning back to growth in FY24.Regarding valuation, FDX's current 14.4X forward earnings multiple is beneath UPS' current 16.7X, with both values residing below their respective five-year medians. FDX sports a Style Score of ""A"" for Value, whereas UPS carries a ""B.""FedEx has also been more consistent with its quarterly results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by an average of 17% across its last four releases compared to UPS' 2%.As shown below, better-than-expected quarterly results have driven FDX's outperformance in 2023, regularly boosting shares post-earnings.Bottom LineFedEx posted results that impressed the market, with shares gaining roughly 5% following the release. Lowered costs, thanks to successful transformative initiatives, drove the better-than-expected results, with the company's profitability improving nicely.And when pitting FedEx against UPS, it appears that FDX shares appear to be the better option. UPS has seen its earnings outlook shift negatively over the recent months, hasn't seen positive reactions to quarterly results, and is expected to witness a growth slowdown in its current year.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

284,26657936-0686-38e9-8692-da4114cb7985,AXP,2023-09-23,Should Value Investors Select American Express (AXP) Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/value-investors-select-american-express-133500910.html,1695389700,STORY,"['AXP', '^GSPC']","[Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put American Express AXP stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, American Express has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.74, as you can see in the chart below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&amp;P 500 stands at about 20.7. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, American Express’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint (which is 16.15) over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it can be a solid entry point.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Finance sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 14.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe should also point out that American Express has a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.90, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for American Express stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, American Express has a P/S ratio of about 1.75. This is a bit lower than the S&amp;P 500 average, which comes in at 3.59 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, American Express currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘B’, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes American Express a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for American Express is just 0.97, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1.16. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, AXP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though American Express might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘C’ and a Momentum score of ‘C’. This gives AXP a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘B’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here &gt;&gt;)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower, while the full year estimate has seen two up and three down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 0.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action  for the stock in the chart below:American Express Company Price and ConsensusAmerican Express Company Price and ConsensusAmerican Express Company price-consensus-chart | American Express Company QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAmerican Express is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, a strong industry rank (among Top 11% of more than 250 industries) instills our confidence. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Financial - SBIC &amp; Commercial Industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo, value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have added about 0.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is NetApp due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.NetApp Q1 Earnings Top EstimatesNetApp reported first-quarter fiscal 2024 non-GAAP earnings of $1.15 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 per share. Yet, the bottom line decreased 4.2% year over year. Management anticipated non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.00-$1.10.Revenues of $1.432 billion declined 10% year over year. NTAP projected revenues in the $1.325-$1.475 billion band. Weak IT spending due to tough macro environment affected performance.However, revenues beat the consensus mark by 1.5%.NetApp continues to expect fiscal 2024 revenues to dip in the mid-to-low single-digit range on a year-over-year basis. However, management now suggests Public Cloud revenue growth to be lower than the earlier expectation owing to a softness in subscription services.The company forecasts non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2024 to be between $5.65 and $5.85.For fiscal 2024, NetApp expects non-GAAP gross margin to be nearly 70%. Non-GAAP operating margin is estimated to be nearly 25%.Top-Line DetailsNTAP reports revenues under two segments, namely, Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud.The Hybrid Cloud segment consists of revenues from enterprise datacenter business including product, support and professional services.The Public Cloud segment comprises revenues from products, which are delivered as-a-service and entail related support. The portfolio contains cloud automation and optimization services, and storage services and cloud infrastructure monitoring services.Revenues from the Hybrid Cloud segment were down 12% year over year to $1.278 billion. The Public Cloud segment’s revenues were up 17% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $154 million.Within the Hybrid Cloud segment, Product revenues (46% of segmental revenues) tumbled 25% year over year to $590 million.Revenues from Support Contracts (48%) totaled $611 million, gaining 2.2% year over year. Professional and Other Services revenues (6%) were $77 million, rose 1.3% year over year.Software product revenues amounted to $342 million, dipping 28.2%.Region-wise, the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific contributed 53%, 31% and 16% to total revenues, respectively.Direct and Indirect revenues added 24% and 76%, respectively, to total revenues.Story continuesKey MetricsDuring the fiscal first quarter, the company’s All-Flash Array Business’ annualized net revenue run rate of $2.8 billion fell 7% year over year. Total billings decreased 17% year over year to $1.3 billion. Deferred revenues were $4.2 billion, unchanged on a year-over-year basis.Public Cloud Services recorded annualized recurring revenues of $619 million, up 6% year over year.Operating DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin of 70.7% expanded 400 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter’s levels.The Hybrid segment’s gross margin was 71.1%, which extended 470 bps year over year. The Public Cloud segment witnessed gross margin of 66.9%, contracting 280 bps year over year.Non-GAAP operating expenses were $703 million compared with $702 million in the prior-year quarter.

However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Occidental Petroleum's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:23% = US$6.8b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.23 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Occidental Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 23% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Occidental Petroleum has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, a comparison with the average industry ROE of 28% also portrays the company's ROE in a good light.

This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Additionally, Occidental Petroleum has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 17% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 17%, over the same period.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Occidental Petroleum's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings.

290,2d935438-ffed-39ec-b183-173f34c82168,COF,2023-09-23,The 7 Most Undervalued Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in September 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-most-undervalued-warren-buffett-184608166.html,1694889968,STORY,"['BRK-A', 'ALLY', 'COF', 'BYDDY', 'KHC', 'BRK-B', 'CHTR', 'CE']","[If you’re among the millions of investors concerned about where to put your money to work, undervalued Warren Buffett stocks to buy may be the place to focus on. Specifically, by aligning your portfolio with certain compelling individual holdings of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), you might be able to get a leg up on market vagaries.Frankly, there’s no one that does it better than the Oracle of Omaha. Primarily, that’s because the man has seen it all and has profited in both good times and bad. For example, the main focus right now centers on inflation. Despite the Federal Reserve’s best efforts, consumer prices remain stubbornly high. While some of us may be facing inflationary conditions for the first time, that’s obviously not the case for Buffett.Second, the legendary investor has a knack for understanding true value rather than chasing the latest fad. By logical deduction, if you can acquire undervalued Warren Buffett stocks, you’ll probably end up the winner over the long haul. With that, below are the key discounts from Berkshire to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWarren Buffett Stocks: Celanese (CE)Cellphone with logo of US chemicals company Celanese Corporation (CE) on screen in front of business website Focus on center-left of phone displaySource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.comBased in Irving, Texas, Celanese (NYSE:CE) is a technology and specialty materials firm. Per its public profile, Celanese is the world’s leading producer of acetic acid, producing about 1.95 million tonnes per year. Per CNBC, Berkshire has a 4.9% stake in the enterprise, representing 0.2% of Berkshire’s portfolio. Since the start of the year, CE gained 26% of its equity value.While it’s not exactly the most stirring examples of Warren Buffett stocks to buy, it makes for a solid investment. For example, the company prints a three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 20.6%, above 76.78% of its peers. Also, it’s consistently profitable, featuring a trailing-year net margin of 12.32%.As for the discount, CE trades at a forward multiple of only 9.66x. In contrast, the sector median stands at a loftier 12.73x. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg CE a moderate buy. Overall, their average price target comes in at $133.13, implying over 3% upside potential.Story continuesCharter Communications (CHTR)The Charter Communications (CHTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comAn intriguing idea among undervalued Warren Buffett stocks to buy, Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) recently made news for its carriage fee beef with Disney (NYSE:DIS). Just in time for Monday Night Football, the bitter standoff found resolution. And with it, CHTR could be worth investigating. Presently, Berkshire has a 2.6% stake in CHTR, representing 0.5% of its portfolio.As I told CGTN America anchor Phillip Yin, ultimately, the negotiated agreement should be a win-win for both parties. In such a competitive and evolving media landscape, there’s really no reason to incur longstanding disputes between programmers and distributors. CHTR has gained almost 32% since the start of the year. It could be more of the same moving forward.Further, CE offers an attractive valuation, trading at only 10.33x forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median value comes in at 12.41x. Lastly, analysts peg CHTR a moderate buy. Overall, the average price target lands at $481.38, implying over 7% upside potential.Warren Buffett Stocks: Capital One Financial (COF)capital one (COF) logo outside of corporate buildingSource: Isabelle OHara/Shutterstock.comOne of the trickiest ideas to decipher regarding Warren Buffett stocks, Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) carries both relevancy and risk. As a bank holding company specializing in credit cards, Capital One basically undergirds the spending behavior of millions of households. With total credit card debt among Americans soaring above $1 trillion, business should be good.However, the challenge is that Americans have over $1 trillion in credit card debt. If something happens to the broader economy – such as mass layoffs – circumstances could get ugly. Still, the Oracle likes COF, with Berkshire owning a 3.3% stake in the financial giant.Speaking of which, Capital One does benefit from attractive financials. Despite its solid revenue growth and consistent profitability, COF trades at a sales multiple of 1.09X. In contrast, the sector median stands at a stratospheric 3.32x. In closing, analysts peg COF as a consensus hold, reflecting the aforementioned concerns. Still, the average price target is $118.33, implying almost 16% upside potential.Ally Financial (ALLY)Three people sit around a table holding financial charts and a tablet device.Source: ShutterstockAnother bank holding company, Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY) provides various financial services. These include car loans, online banking via a direct bank, corporate lending, vehicle insurance and mortgage loans, among others. However, the main concern about Ally is the rising interest rate environment and its impact to consumer sentiment.For now, ALLY seems unperturbed, with shares gaining nearly 17% since the January opener. It’s also one of the undervalued Warren Buffett stocks (some might say for good reason). Per CNBC, Berkshire has a 9.6% stake in Ally, translating to 0.2% of the conglomerate’s portfolio.While questions exist, Ally is so far doing a good job. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate is 16.2%, above 71.75% of its rivals. Just as well, ALLY trades at a revenue multiple of only 0.94x. Again, the sector median is 3.32x. Just like Capital One, analysts peg ALLY as a hold. However, the average price target clocks in at $33.08, implying just over 16% upside potential.Warren Buffett Stocks: Kraft Heinz (KHC)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Kraft Heinz (KHC) website.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comAn idea among Warren Buffett stocks to buy that aligns with the Oracle’s interests – basically junk food – Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) presents a possibly delectable addition to your portfolio. Especially with the present economic environment, Kraft Heinz makes plenty of sense. Representing a food and beverage company, Kraft can bank on the trade-down effect as more consumers eschew restaurants for cooking at home and eating in.Obviously, I can’t tell if that’s what the Oracle was thinking. But whatever the reasoning, Buffett loves KHC. Through Berkshire, the Oracle has a 26.5% stake in Kraft Heinz, translating to 3.1% of the conglomerate’s portfolio.As for its financials, its long-term revenue growth could use some work. However, KHC benefits from strong profit margins along with consistent printing of annual net income. Currently, shares trade at a forward multiple of 11.36x, favorably lower than 75% of its peers. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg KHC as a moderate buy with a $40.47 price target, implying nearly 20% growth.BYD (BYDDF)Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stockSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve FinkelsenOne of the most enticing and forward-looking ideas among undervalued Warren Buffett stocks, BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) is a Chinese conglomerate manufacturing firm. Most of the attention BYD generates stems from its manufacturing of automobiles, particularly its electric vehicles. It’s an interesting choice because Buffett once said to never bet against America. I suppose that also means betting on China.Needless to say, BYD has been a solid investment. Since the start of the year, BYDDF gained just under 23% of equity value. Over the past five years, shares are up more than 351%. Per CNBC, Berkshire has a 9% stake in BYD, representing 0.9% of the former entity’s portfolio.Financially, BYD banks on stellar growth. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 54.4%, above nearly 97% of its rivals. So, it’s not particularly discounted. However, it does trade at 3.89x operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median is 8.83x. Looking to the Street, Barclays’ Jiong Shao rates BYDDF as a buy with a $40 price target, implying over 27% upside.General Motors (GM)Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comSpeaking about not betting against America, it doesn’t get more patriotic than investing in auto giant General Motors (NYSE:GM). While the company has endured many market cycles – some of them not being particularly pleasant – it’s still standing. It hasn’t been the best performer, slipping just under parity for the year. However, it could be one of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy.Fundamentally, I appreciate the smart pivot management has made regarding electrification. Thanks to its rich history, GM commands a wealth of iconic auto models. By electrifying them, GM can open its addressable market to new-generation car buyers while not alienating its faithful following. For instance, I believe Chevrolet’s electric Corvette should be a massive winner.I could go on for days about why it’s such an amazing idea. However, we must get to the value proposition. At the moment, shares trade at only 4.36X forward earnings, favorably below 92.94% of its rivals. On a final note, analysts peg GM as a moderate buy with a $50.53 price target, implying over 50% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with POOL. Click here to check it out. ULTA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ULTAAs of 2023-09-22, Ulta Beauty Inc(NASDAQ:ULTA)'s intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $748.01. It's currently trading at a price of $403.615. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 46.04%. The company is significantly undervalued.Navigating Market Uncertainty: Ulta Beauty Inc's Intrinsic ValueThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Ulta Beauty Inc(NASDAQ:ULTA)'s intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$24.92GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.44%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 19.40% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=380.44Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=367.57Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=748.01Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $597.88. This valuation indicates that the Ulta Beauty Inc(NASDAQ:ULTA) is significantly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 32.49%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The award has been offered by the Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Philadelphia, PA.Valued at $21.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by March 2029. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will procure four swashplate assemblies and 28 rotary blade sleeves for CH-53K helicopters.Work related to this contract will be carried out in Stratford, CT.Significance of CH-53K HelicopterCH-53K aircraft is designed to be intelligent, reliable, low maintenance and survivable in the most austere and remote forward operating bases. The helicopter has been designed and built to the exact standards of the U.S. Marine Corps and serves as the combat force’s critical land and sea-based logistics connector.With its unrivaled speed, lift capacity and maneuverability, the CH-53K can complete the most demanding mission requirements in less time with fewer sorties than other helicopters in its class.Such remarkable features have led to an increased demand for this helicopter, thereby resulting in a steady inflow of orders for LMT, like the latest one.

The expansion is a result of an agreement between the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC), and will be facilitated by a $200 million investment from the commonwealth.The agreement aims to enhance passenger rail service in Western Pennsylvania while preserving a critical freight rail corridor. ""This agreement lays the groundwork for expanded passenger rail service in Western Pennsylvania,"" said PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll. He further emphasized that the agreement would provide key mobility and economic benefits by reducing commute times, connecting hundreds of thousands of residents, and boosting local economies.The commonwealth's investment will be directed towards ""infrastructure and safety improvements"" built and maintained by Norfolk Southern. These include upgraded rail lines, sidings, and necessary communications signals infrastructure. PennDOT has also applied for grant funds through the Federal Railroad Administration to help finance these improvements.Supporters of the agreement believe it aligns with statewide aspirations for expanding passenger rail. Senator Wayne Langerholc, R-Clearfield and chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, praised the announcement, noting that it keeps Pennsylvania on course to achieving more rail service for western Pennsylvanians, a goal he prioritized upon election.In addition to serving more Pennsylvanians with modern, reliable passenger rail, this expansion is expected to connect Pennsylvania communities and stimulate job creation, economic development, and infrastructure investment. The move is seen as a win-win for business and passengers alike.In related developments across the state, the Schuylkill River Passenger Rail Authority in eastern Pennsylvania awaits news from the Federal Railroad Administration regarding a $500,000 grant to plan for a potential route between Philadelphia and Reading.Story continuesThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

298,413f2e1e-ecdb-38ce-b880-1de823fe49c9,NSC,2023-09-23,UAW strike: Why railroads could feel the impact too,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/uaw-strike-why-railroads-could-152101927.html,1695396061,VIDEO,"['F', 'CSX', 'NSC', 'GM', 'UNP', 'STLA']","[The autoworkers are continuing their strikes against the Big Three automakers, Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA). Most economists expect for there to be some ripple effects across the U.S. economy. One industry that could feel the impact is railroads. Cowen Senior Research Analyst Jason Seidl tells Yahoo Finance Live that ""autos have been one of the few brights spots"" for railroads in what has been an overall ""tough"" year for the industry. Seidl says he does expect the strikes to eventually start showing up in the railroad companies' numbers, though it's not being seen yet due to lags in the data.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: If the UAW strike becomes prolonged, the effects could span out to industries outside of autos. Joining us now with the impact we could see on rail, we've got Jason Seidl who is the Cowen senior research analyst. So just broad strokes, set the set the table for us here. What are some of those impacts that you're anticipating, based on any correlations that we could see overflow from the UAW strike right now?JASON SEIDL: Well, thanks for having me. So it's been a very tough year for the railroads. Volumes of have not been what everyone has hoped for. We're down about 4.5% on the year. And ironically, autos have been one of the few bright spots. We have double digit growth in automotive traffic for the railroads in 2023.So if you take that away, you're adding over a half a percentage point on the downward side, the total traffic for the rails. And so we are expecting this to eventually start hitting numbers. You're not seeing it yet, because there's a couple week lag in what you see in the numbers.The railroads already reported on a week lag, but there's also some finished vehicles on the ground that they can still move as we head into the strike here. But a prolonged strike, you're going to really get an impact for the railroads, and that's coming with a backdrop of just everything else putting pressure on them.Story continues- Yeah, certainly. And, Jason, as we're speaking right now, we're just getting the headline crossing that today at noon all parts distribution facilities here in for GM and Stellantis are being called to strike. When you take a look at where some of these locations will be, the strike for GM parts plants in Michigan, two locations there, strike of all US Stellantis part plants, that is according to sources here in terms of what we are seeing crossing Bloomberg right now. And Fein saying that GM, Stellantis still needs some, quote, ""serious pushing.""Now, they are continuing their strike against Ford, but they are not going to be expanding their strike with Ford. So, Jason, as we talk about some of the ripple effects and what you were just saying in terms of the lag effects that we could see for the rails, the longer that this goes on, how big of an impact could we see? If this is a strike that lasts, we're talking 30 days, potentially 45 days, which is what we just heard from our last guest.JASON SEIDL: We've already taken some of our numbers down yesterday to account for the slower-than-expected traffic that we've seen and maybe some minor impacts from the strike that we're seeing. Remember, total automotive exposure for the railroads is somewhere between 4% and 5%, depending upon the carrier, so it's not really large. But it's going to impact them, like I said, because you're already in an environment where the railroads have their own labor that are costs are going higher. Remember, when the railroad workers were about to strike, they got ordered back to work by Congress. But that was the most expensive rail labor contract in history, and the railroads have been around for a while. So you have that flowing through on the cost side.Additionally, on the cost side, you had some weather impacts here in the near term. And additionally, on the cost side, you're seeing fuel rise up. Fuel has dropped from January to July. But post the end of July, we've seen a big rise in fuel, and the rails get hit on that with about a 60-day lag on the recovery side. So near terms, the railroads have a lot of negative things going on, and unfortunately, very few positives these days.]"

He later elaborated that cash is not safe because ""it will be taxed by inflation."" But as time passed, Dalio's view on cash has made a U-turn.""Temporarily, right now, cash I think is good ... and the interest rates are fine. I don't think it will be sustained that way,"" he said at the Milken Institute Asia Summit in Singapore last week.In the U.S., the Federal Reserve has implemented significant interest rate hikes to cool inflation. The federal funds rate is now at its highest level since 2001. For investors, some high-yield savings accounts are now paying over 5% annual percentage yields (APYs).Don't Miss:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes and you only need $100.Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession. Here are 3 high-yield options to add significant income to your portfolio.Dalio also told the audience what he doesn't want to own at the moment.""I don't want to own debt, you know, bonds and those kinds of things,"" he said.When asked about his approach to deploying capital, Dalio said that he would want to be ""in the right places"" geographically. He also emphasized the importance of diversification and paying attention to disruptions.As the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, Dalio knows about deploying capital. Here's a look at some notable investment themes in Bridgewater's portfolio.Emerging Market EquitiesDalio's investment horizon extends beyond U.S. borders.According to Bridgewater's latest Form 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Dalio's fund held 17,932,948 shares of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:IEMG) at the end of the second quarter. With the position valued at $883.92 million at the time, IEMG was the second largest publicly traded holding in Bridgewater's portfolio.Story continuesIEMG holds more than 2,700 stocks and provides exposure to a broad range of emerging market companies. Its top three holdings are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.Bridgewater also owned 7,848,503 shares of Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:VWO) at the end of June, a stake valued at $319.28 million.VWO is another ETF that gives investors access to emerging markets like China, India, Brazil and South Africa. It holds more than 5,000 stocks.In a MarketWatch interview published last October, Dalio said that opportunities will ""come in different regions"" over the next five years.""As we look at the world, we have to recognize that there are bright spots and there are less bright spots, and places like emerging Asia, places such as Singapore and Vietnam and Indonesia and places like that are bright spots,"" he said. ""India, I think, is going to be a brighter spot.""Consumer StaplesIn an era where artificial intelligence and cutting-edge technologies dominate the headlines, consumer staples may not seem like an exciting business on the surface.But Dalio still likes the segment.Bridgewater's third-largest publicly traded holding at the end of June was Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (NYSE:PG), a company deeply entrenched in the consumer staples business. With well-known brands like Tide, Bounty, Gillette and Pampers, the company offers a range of products that households buy regularly, allowing it to generate consistent revenue through thick and thin.Beverages are another part of the consumer staples category. And rather than choosing between Pepsi and Coke, Dalio is going with both.Bridgewater's Form 13F filing revealed that the firm held 2,566,566 shares of PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and 8,214,890 shares of Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) as of June 30, valued at $475.38 million and $494.7 million, respectively.It's easy to see why both companies can be resilient: Even in a recession, a can of Coke or Pepsi is still affordable to most people.Another reason many investors are attracted to consumer staples companies is their ability to pay reliable dividends.In May, PepsiCo announced its 51st consecutive annual dividend increase. Coca-Cola's board approved the company's 61st consecutive payout increase in February. Meanwhile, Procter &amp; Gamble has paid a higher dividend to shareholders for 67 years straight.Read next:Elon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

Despite Coca-Cola's stock trading at a lower valuation of 5.7 times revenue compared to Monster's 8.7 times, and Monster demonstrating superior revenue growth and a stronger financial position, an analysis of various factors suggests that Coca-Cola may offer higher returns over the next three years.Monster Beverage has seen impressive revenue growth with an average annual rate of 14.6% over the past three years, outpacing Coca-Cola's 5.6%. This growth is attributed to strong demand for its energy drinks, new product launches, and international expansion. On the other hand, Coca-Cola's revenue growth has been supported by both at-home and away-from-home channels due to robust pricing trends. In addition, its North America and Latin America segments registered a notable 19% year-over-year sales growth in 2022.Monster Beverage also outperformed Coca-Cola in terms of returns over the past few years, posting a remarkable 120% return compared to Coca-Cola's 8% decline and the S&amp;P 500 index's 15% increase.Despite slower sales growth, however, Coca-Cola remains more profitable. Its operating margin slipped from 29.9% in 2019 to 28.8% in 2022, while Monster Beverage's fell from 33.4% to 25.1%, largely due to rising costs.In terms of financial risk, Monster Beverage has an advantage with cash making up 35% of its assets compared to Coca-Cola's 14%. Furthermore, Coca-Cola’s debt-to-equity ratio sits around 16%, whereas Monster Beverage operates debt-free.When it comes to valuation multiples, Coca-Cola appears more attractive. It's expected to see its price-to-sales (P/S) multiple expand, potentially leading to better returns over the next three years. Currently, Coca-Cola's stock trades at 5.7 times sales compared to its five-year average of 6.8 times, whereas Monster Beverage's stock trades at 8.7 times revenues versus its five-year average of 4.9 times.Story continuesMonster Beverage's higher P/S multiple is somewhat justified by its strong revenue growth, but the current figure of 9 times sales seems stretched, particularly given its operating margins are lower than the 33% level seen in 2019, before the pandemic hit.In conclusion, while Monster Beverage has shown superior revenue growth and a stronger financial position, Coca-Cola's profitability and lower valuation multiple indicate it might offer better returns over the next three years. Machine learning analysis predicts an expected return of 8% for Coca-Cola and a -1% return for Monster Beverage over this period.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned -4.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.4% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coke belongs, has lost 3.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.69 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.82 indicates a change of +7% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Coke is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Coke, the consensus sales estimate of $11.48 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.8%. The $45.01 billion and $47.43 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.7% and +5.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $11.97 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.7%. EPS of $0.78 for the same period compares with $0.70 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.03%. The EPS surprise was +8.33%.Over the last four quarters, Coke surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

VEEV is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strong product portfolio. The optimism led by a solid second-quarter fiscal 2024 performance and strategic deals are expected to contribute further. Stiff competition and data security threats persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 24.9% compared with 25.4% growth of the industry and a 17.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500 Composite.The renowned provider of cloud-based software applications and data solutions for the life sciences industry has a market capitalization of $32.65 billion. The company projects 24.5% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 9.9% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: We are optimistic about Veeva Systems’ unique solutions, which include Veeva Vault, Veeva CRM (customer relationship management), Veeva Network and Veeva OpenData.In September, Veeva Systems announced Veeva Study Portal, a free cloud application to simplify research site access to sponsor technologies. The same month, the company announced Veeva Vault Batch Release, a new cloud application that will enable faster, more confident Good Manufacturing Processes release and market-ship decisions.Strategic Deals: We are upbeat about Veeva Systems’ inking of a slew of notable deals. In August, the company announced that Civica Rx had adopted Veeva Vault LIMS to optimize quality control.In July, Veeva Systems announced that Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, was using Veeva Vault MedInquiry as its global medical information management system.Strong Q2 Results: Veeva Systems’ solid second-quarter fiscal 2024 results buoy optimism. The company saw an uptick in the overall top and bottom lines and robust performances by both segments during the quarter. The company continued to benefit from its flagship Vault platform. Veeva Systems’ continued strength in its Commercial Solutions with new small-sized to mid-sized customer additions and strong win rates in core Veeva CRM were also seen.Story continuesDownsidesData Security Threats: Veeva Systems’ solutions involve the storage and transmission of its customers’ proprietary information and personal information of medical professionals, patients and clinical trial participants, and other sensitive information. Unauthorized access or other security breaches or incidents could damage the company’s reputation. The company may be unable to adequately anticipate security threats or implement adequate preventative measures, in part, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target.Stiff Competition: Veeva Systems operates in a highly competitive market. In new sales cycles within the company’s largest product categories, it competes with other cloud-based solutions from providers that make applications for the life sciences industry. The company’s Commercial Cloud and Veeva Vault application suites also compete to replace client-server-based legacy solutions offered by large companies and other smaller application providers.Estimate TrendVeeva Systems is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024.

307,5b144b9f-70d5-3885-9159-8ba2cd881355,DVA,2023-09-23,4 Stocks Trading Near 52-Week High That Can Climb Further,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-trading-near-52-121200285.html,1695384720,STORY,"['DVA', 'GIII']","[Stocks hitting their 52-week high and delivering consistent performance in the past few quarters offer attractive opportunities to investors while building a portfolio. This is because stocks near that level are perceived to be winners. However, stocks touching a new 52-week high are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculations are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, investors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices. Stocks such as GIII Apparel Group GIII, Constellation Energy Corporation CEG, Consolidated Water CWCO and DaVita DVA are expected to maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs.  More information on a stock is necessary to understand whether or not there is scope for further upside.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The strategy borrows from the basics of momentum investing. This technique bets on “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.In fact, overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay a premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Story continuesSetting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring the continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High &gt;= .11This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.11 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks &gt; 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks &gt; 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales &lt;= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate &lt;= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) &gt;= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank =1No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since its inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price &gt;= 8This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $8 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) &gt;= 100000The inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are four stocks of the eight stocks that made it through the screen:G-III Apparel Group is a manufacturer, designer and distributor of apparel and accessories under licensed brands, owned brands and private label brands. G-III Apparel’s strategic priorities include driving power brands across categories, enhancing its portfolio via ownership of brands and licensing opportunities, expanding its global reach, maximizing omnichannel capabilities and scaling the private label business. G-III Apparel has also been making progress on rightsizing the inventory. Management remains optimistic about the company’s diversified portfolio of key brands, namely DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Vilebrequin, Nautica and Halston.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GIII’s fiscal 2024 earnings has increased 14.3% to $3.27 per share in the past 30 days.

Constellation Energy plans to invest nearly $7.6 billion during the 2023-2025 period to further strengthen its operation and generate more clean energy.Amid the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the company decided to utilize nearly 45-47% of projected capital expenditures to acquire nuclear fuel, including additional nuclear fuel to increase inventory levels that will ensure clean power production from its nuclear units. In June 2023, CEG announced a deal to acquire NRG Energy’s 44% ownership stake in the South Texas Project Electric Generating Station, a 2,645-megawatts (MWs) dual-unit nuclear plant. This acquisition is expected to close at the end of 2023, which will expand the clean energy production portfolio of the company.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1.

The company is poised to benefit from rising demand for desalination units, given its expertise in the field. It is expanding operations via acquisitions and organic projects.

308,3f60a719-88d2-3bbf-975b-15f33f3b593e,VRSN,2023-09-23,"Investors Heavily Search VeriSign, Inc. (VRSN): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-verisign-inc-130007004.html,1695387607,STORY,['VRSN'],"[VeriSign (VRSN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this internet infrastructure services provider have returned -1.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Software and Services industry, to which VeriSign belongs, has lost 0.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, VeriSign is expected to post earnings of $1.74 per share, indicating a change of +10.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.02 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.75 indicates a change of +10.4% from what VeriSign is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, VeriSign is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of VeriSign, the consensus sales estimate of $373.79 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.7%. The $1.49 billion and $1.62 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.7% and +8.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVeriSign reported revenues of $372 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.7%. EPS of $1.79 for the same period compares with $1.54 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $372.02 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.01%. The EPS surprise was +5.29%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.VeriSign is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about VeriSign. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A niche focus, improved pricing, effective risk management, strategic buyouts and solid capital position should continue to drive this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company.Markel, with a market capitalization of $20.2 billion, has a decent history of delivering positive surprises. It beat estimates in three of the last four reported quarters, while missing in one. Earnings of this insurer increased 29% in the last five years, outperforming the industry average of 10.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCan the Stock Retain the Momentum?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings is pegged at $84.42 per share, implying an increase of 26% from the year-ago reported figure on 10.2% higher revenues of $14.6 billion. The consensus estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $93.16, implying an increase of 10.4% from the year-ago reported figure on 8.8% higher revenues of $15.9 billion.MKL has been generating improved premiums. Increase in new business volume, strong retention levels, continued increases in rates and expanded product offerings should help MKL retain the momentum.Markel aims to double the size of its insurance operations and thus targets $10 billion of annual insurance premiums in five years. This should lead to $1 billion of annual underwriting profit. MKL envisions to achieve this target, largely banking on organic growth of its existing operations. We estimate operating revenues to witness a three-year CAGR (2022-2025) of 13.4%.Investment income benefits from an improving rate environment. Thus, Markel’s fixed maturity portfolio is poised to gain, given higher yield rates. Markel believes the impact will become more meaningful in the future as lower-yielding securities mature and are replaced by higher-yielding securities. We estimate a 42.7% increase in net investment income in 2023.Through Markel Ventures, MKL has been investing in the ownership of the best asset management firms. The company has been pursuing acquisitions to achieve profitable growth in insurance operations and to create additional value on a diversified basis in Markel Ventures operations.Markel has a solid capital position that aids in effective capital deployment.Story continuesAttractive ValuationThe company’s shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 16.7, lower than the industry average of 19.7.

For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Retail health care is a growing area of interest for many traditional retailers. But most are in the early stages of figuring out where they can make money. GE Health Care is looking at consumer medical devices while some of the big box retailers like Walmart and even Best Buy are looking for ways to get a piece of the $4 trillion health care pie. Yahoo finance's Anjalee Khemlani has more on this story for us, Anj.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right, Seana. You, of course, know the players that are in the retail health care space thinking of CVS, Walmart, and Walgreens who have been increasingly providing provider services or checkups. But now, we're starting to see, really, a growth in demand for things like medical devices especially as more care gets put in the home. And that's where companies like Best Buy and GE are starting to take a look at where they can play.Best Buy, for example, in a recent interview told me that they are looking at bringing some of those medical devices into the stores, taking advantage of their big footprint as well as Geek Squad as support for these individuals, especially catering to seniors and the like. So they're talking about you know putting, for example, scooters in the stores, and hearing aids as well, especially as they're starting to roll out what they're calling Experience Stores, so where you get to try the product. That's something that's really been a focus for them.They've already been building out their health department which is something that has been sort of quietly working on deals since about 2017. $1.2 billion already invested in some of these deals for tech platforms or at-home device companies, Geek Squad, like I mentioned, to help the seniors, and those Experience Stores.Story continuesAnd I thought it was quite interesting. And so I asked, well, what else could we expect? What kinds of products do we anticipate rolling out, things that could be used by the elderly.And I got that part from the president of Best Buy Health saying, quote, ""You would indeed see new categories like electric scooters, next to traditional tech customers love to see from Best Buy like TVs."" But in addition to that, they have the interactive over-the-counter hearing aids which we know is a recent progress from Medicare. So all of these things coming together.Meanwhile, GE, you think about them as just a retail product maker for a long time, right, and appliances? But they're also pretty big in the medical device space. And they, too, are starting to see this trend develop.And looking at where they get to play a role, so they've been doing stuff like creating handheld at-home devices. They recently acquired a company called Caption Health which helps with AI guiding for those, say, like an ultrasound machine, a portable ultrasound machine. And that could really put these products in consumers' hands.And they're looking at partnerships with some of these retailers. One of the things that I was told was, you know, think about maybe getting a mammogram while you're at Walmart or CVS? You know, why not? So there's certainly opportunity. And you're starting to see the segment really take off now.BRAD SMITH: All right. Anjalee, thank you so much for tracking all of that, continuing to keep it on our radars as well. Yahoo Finance's own Anjalee Khemlani, appreciate it.]"

(NASDAQ:AAPL) leads the global smartphone market with a market share of 28.52%, as of August 2023.

Tech companies are adding efficient and innovative technologies to the healthcare sector that are ready to bring digital transformation to healthcare. The global digital health market is projected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2030 from an estimated $211 billion in 2022. That reflects a massive potential for tech companies to explore this growth opportunity in health care.  Let's discuss two tech giants that are innovating in the healthcare space.Deloitte’s report on the tech industry outlook highlights that the Big Five invested more than $3 billion into health care in 2021, in disclosed venture capital investments.

Owing to a strong growth forecast in the medium term, the Philippines GDP in US Dollar nominal terms is poised to exceed the USD $1 trillion mark by 2033. Key drivers of growth for the economy include rapid boost in private consumption spending, improved remittance inflows, an upturn in government infrastructure spending, and a boom in urban household incomes.The country is also set to benefit from the recently implemented RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) trade deal, aimed at lowering trade barriers, improving market access, streamlining custom-related procedures, and gaining tariff concessions from trading partners. The deal will also help build manufacturing supply chains within the RCEP region across different countries.Owing to its reputation as one of the fastest developing countries in the world, the country promises enormous opportunities that can be tapped into. The next few years will witness the economy growing at a forecasted 4% or more annually despite the global slowdown. Being the second largest center for Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), it boasts a strong industrial sector and a richness of natural resources, and its booming economy is ultimately attracting individuals from all over the world.One demographic that has been increasingly interested in the country's economic prosperity is retirees. Having no significant savings of their own and hoping to retire to a country that promises financial ease and improved quality of life, many retirees are now turning towards this country to help fulfill their retirement dreams.

(NASDAQ: MAXN), can help potential retirees reduce energy costs and decrease reliance on the local power grid. Similarly, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) and  Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) have also expressed their interest in investing in the country. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is an American multinational healthcare and insurance company that aims to invest P800 million ($14.125 million) to set up health information management services operations in Davao, generating 1,500 jobs.Meanwhile, Analog Devices, Inc.

He later elaborated that cash is not safe because ""it will be taxed by inflation."" But as time passed, Dalio's view on cash has made a U-turn.""Temporarily, right now, cash I think is good ... and the interest rates are fine. I don't think it will be sustained that way,"" he said at the Milken Institute Asia Summit in Singapore last week.In the U.S., the Federal Reserve has implemented significant interest rate hikes to cool inflation. The federal funds rate is now at its highest level since 2001. For investors, some high-yield savings accounts are now paying over 5% annual percentage yields (APYs).Don't Miss:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes and you only need $100.Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession. Here are 3 high-yield options to add significant income to your portfolio.Dalio also told the audience what he doesn't want to own at the moment.""I don't want to own debt, you know, bonds and those kinds of things,"" he said.When asked about his approach to deploying capital, Dalio said that he would want to be ""in the right places"" geographically. He also emphasized the importance of diversification and paying attention to disruptions.As the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, Dalio knows about deploying capital. Here's a look at some notable investment themes in Bridgewater's portfolio.Emerging Market EquitiesDalio's investment horizon extends beyond U.S. borders.According to Bridgewater's latest Form 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Dalio's fund held 17,932,948 shares of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:IEMG) at the end of the second quarter. With the position valued at $883.92 million at the time, IEMG was the second largest publicly traded holding in Bridgewater's portfolio.Story continuesIEMG holds more than 2,700 stocks and provides exposure to a broad range of emerging market companies. Its top three holdings are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.Bridgewater also owned 7,848,503 shares of Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:VWO) at the end of June, a stake valued at $319.28 million.VWO is another ETF that gives investors access to emerging markets like China, India, Brazil and South Africa. It holds more than 5,000 stocks.In a MarketWatch interview published last October, Dalio said that opportunities will ""come in different regions"" over the next five years.""As we look at the world, we have to recognize that there are bright spots and there are less bright spots, and places like emerging Asia, places such as Singapore and Vietnam and Indonesia and places like that are bright spots,"" he said. ""India, I think, is going to be a brighter spot.""Consumer StaplesIn an era where artificial intelligence and cutting-edge technologies dominate the headlines, consumer staples may not seem like an exciting business on the surface.But Dalio still likes the segment.Bridgewater's third-largest publicly traded holding at the end of June was Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (NYSE:PG), a company deeply entrenched in the consumer staples business. With well-known brands like Tide, Bounty, Gillette and Pampers, the company offers a range of products that households buy regularly, allowing it to generate consistent revenue through thick and thin.Beverages are another part of the consumer staples category. And rather than choosing between Pepsi and Coke, Dalio is going with both.Bridgewater's Form 13F filing revealed that the firm held 2,566,566 shares of PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and 8,214,890 shares of Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) as of June 30, valued at $475.38 million and $494.7 million, respectively.It's easy to see why both companies can be resilient: Even in a recession, a can of Coke or Pepsi is still affordable to most people.Another reason many investors are attracted to consumer staples companies is their ability to pay reliable dividends.In May, PepsiCo announced its 51st consecutive annual dividend increase. Coca-Cola's board approved the company's 61st consecutive payout increase in February. Meanwhile, Procter &amp; Gamble has paid a higher dividend to shareholders for 67 years straight.Read next:Elon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

It saw a dubious company, with fake employees and an address that was a glorified PO box, sell and distribute fake airplane parts that ended up in planes belonging to some of the world’s biggest airlines. On Thursday night, American Airlines became the fourth, and so far final, airline to have found parts from AOG Technics in its aircraft. Southwest kicked off the disclosures from various airlines around the world in early September, when it became the first to announce it had located an unregistered part from AOG Technics.American Airlines “identified the uncertified components on a small number of aircraft,” according to an emailed statement to Fortune, while Southwest told Fortune it had identified one engine that contained two parts from AOG Technics.The parts scandal comes as the latest development in a series of difficulties that have embroiled the airline industry. It has had two consecutive summers plagued with seemingly constant flight delays and cancellations as “revenge travel” grips a worldwide public eager to get out after a pandemic-era hibernation. American Airlines and United both had to navigate the high-wire act of negotiating new pilots union contracts—and both did so successfully. But the prospect of faulty parts, albeit affecting a small fraction of the world’s fleet of roughly 25,500 commercial aircraft, is swiftly piling up delays. Regulators, airlines, and parts suppliers around the world are scrambling to track down possible bogus parts as the AOG Technics scandal spreads from the U.S. all the way to Australia.The mysterious London-based firm stands accused of falsifying certain documents and shipping the suspect parts to airline repair shops around the world. Companies like AOG Technics are middlemen that supply parts to independent firms that airlines contract to do repairs on their planes. The parts in question were used to repair jet engines made by CFM International, a joint venture between GE and the French firm Safran, used in older models of Airbus and Boeing engines. CFM is now suing AOG Technics in London’s High Court to get access to documents that would illustrate the extent of its fraud, so that all the bogus parts can be tracked down. So far, CFM believes AOG Technics may have sold thousands of parts with fraudulent documentation.Story continues“Parts are accompanied by a lifetime of paperwork,” said Robert Mann, president of the airline industry consulting firm R.W. Mann and Company. In the aviation industry, every part of a plane is carefully tracked to ensure its provenance and quality are accounted for. A single faulty part could have catastrophic safety consequences.CFM, the engine manufacturer, became aware of the issues in June when a Portuguese repair shop alerted it to the existence of allegedly forged documents bearing its name, according to Reuters. By August, the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (the country’s equivalent of the Federal Aviation Administration) had released a safety notice announcing it was “investigating the supply of a large number of Suspect Unapproved Parts” originating from AOG Technics. Airlines and maintenance shops that had purchased any parts from AOG Technics were encouraged to verify whether they had actually come from where the distributor claimed they did.Europe’s aviation regulator, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), released a notice around the same time confirming that certain documents had been forged to make it appear as if AOG Technics’ parts had come from legitimate manufacturers. “In each confirmed example, the approved organization, identified on the [Authorized Release Certificate], has attested that the form did not originate from within their organization, and the certificate has been falsified,” the EASA’s statement read. On Thursday the FAA became the latest regulator to issue a notice about AOG Technics’ bogus parts scheme.A “deep fake” company in the gray market of airplane parts“While there have always been gray and black markets in aircraft parts, mostly purchased by questionable customers, this is a case of a “deep fake” company masquerading as a legitimate supplier that deceived many legitimate buyers,” Mann said.He told Fortune that gray market products are often component’s that are either certified or deemed repairable but don’t meet some other requirement and should therefore be scrapped. Instead these parts “get sold cheaply to customers who need inexpensive replacements.” Black market dealings can be slightly more nefarious in nature, often entailing sale of military technology to countries that are under international sanctions, such as selling spare F-14 fighter jets to Iran.Mann also laid some portion of the blame at the buyers’ feet. “It is also disturbing that sophisticated customers who should have been able to properly vet the supplier were nonetheless duped, potentially placing safety of customers, employees, and aircraft at risk,” he said.As of last week the EASA said “to date there have been no reports of problems resulting from the suspect unapproved parts.”What do we know about AOG Technics and its founder?AOG Technics was founded by Jose Alejandro Zamora Yrala in 2015, according to public filings in the UK. In addition to allegedly forging documents for airplane parts it appears that AOG Technics created several fake LinkedIn profiles claiming to be company executives, according to Bloomberg. The profiles listed for its chief commercial officer Ray Kwong and an executive sales representative Johnny Rico featured stock photos and employment histories that couldn’t be verified by any of their purported former employers.A further look into other filings under Yrala’s name show he founded two other companies in the UK: real estate company Kensho Group LTD and ecom vendor Sunwave Solutions. Yrala’s business partner at Sunwave Ricardo Maquilon Chedrauy told Bloomberg the company sold kitchen appliances “on Amazon to kill time during the pandemic.” Kensho folded in January 2023 and Sunwave appears to still be operational—or at least hasn’t filed for dissolution.Yrala’s filings offer some insight into businesses that were run in an unusual fashion. Several of the filings are riddled with typos, including misspelled executive titles and oddly capitalized words that appear to have happened when someone hit caps lock instead of the “A” key.  Other documents show a series of shifting corporate addresses, some of which end up back at either a coworking space in London and the offices of a now-retired accountant in a sleepy West Sussex town.A Certificate of Incorporation filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales in January 2021 listed Kensho’s headquarters at the same London address of AOG Technics—the North Nova building just a few blocks from Buckingham Palace. Within the upscale, gleaming office tower AOG Technics rented a “virtual” address from coworking space The Argyll Club for $100 a month, according to Bloomberg. In April 2021, Kensho requested an address change to a residence in Haywards Heath, West Sussex that is the same address of Brian Cook Associates, a private accounting practice listed as an agent in the original certificate of incorporation. That same West Sussex address was used to incorporate Yrala’s ecom company Sunwave Solutions. (Brian Cook did not respond to a request for comment.)AOG Technics’ website and LinkedIn profile are no longer active and a Google search for the company lists it as “permanently closed.” The company did not respond to a request for comment. Lawyers for Yrala and AOG told Reuters they are cooperating fully with an investigation opened by the CAA.What airlines have found fake parts? Southwest Airlines was the first major airline to disclose that it had found uncertified parts that originated from AOG Technics in its aircraft. It first became aware of the problem in August “and took necessary steps to ensure we do not have any parts in our fleet from AOG,” the company said. After Southwest’s suppliers conducted a review of its parts the company removed two low pressure turbine blades from one of its jets.A few days later, Virgin Australia also found a turbine blade with forged documents had been used in its planes. The fact parts from a European supplier were found in airlines in Oceania and North America illustrated just how global an issue the industry was facing and how difficult it would be to track down every individual part that may have been allegedly sold under false pretenses. A week later Virgin Australia discovered another, different part, this time a turbine nozzle, had been used in a second jet. Both planes were grounded until replacements could be installed. A spokesperson for Virgin Australia said safety is the company's ""highest priority"" and it applies a ""highly stringent approach to maintenance"" to ensure it is upheld.Earlier this week, United became the third airline to disclose it had identified AOG Technics’ bogus parts in its airplanes. Two United jets were found to have had unregistered parts in their engines, the company said. Both planes are undergoing the requisite maintenance to replace the part before being used again. United will “continue to investigate as new information becomes available from our suppliers,” the company said. American Airlines said it would “continue working” with suppliers and the FAA “to ensure these parts are no longer in our supply or otherwise in use on our aircraft.”Update 22, Sept. 2023: This article has been updated to include a statement from Virgin Australia.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 21.70% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=618.97Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=643.34Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=1126.25Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $1301.28. This valuation indicates that the O'Reilly Automotive Inc(NASDAQ:ORLY) is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 28.36%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Most Mentally Stimulating Jobs According to Reddit.Why are Mentally Stimulating Jobs Important?A recent analysis published in The BMJ suggests that mentally stimulating jobs may have a protective effect against dementia. Researchers combined data from multiple studies that examined the relationship between work factors and chronic diseases, disability, and mortality. They found that individuals with cognitively stimulating jobs with independent decision-making and demanding tasks had a 23% lower risk of developing dementia compared to those with less stimulating jobs. The studies, conducted in the United States and Europe, followed participants who were dementia-free at baseline for several years. After accounting for other dementia risk factors, it was observed that those in less stimulating jobs were more likely to experience cognitive decline. However, the analysis couldn't definitively establish whether job type directly impacted the brain or if other factors were at play. Further research is needed to clarify this relationship. Nonetheless, the findings highlight the potential cognitive benefits of mentally challenging jobs.Are Workers Mentally or Emotionally Involved with Their Jobs?According to Ardent Partners, today, approximately 40% to 50% of the current workforce consists of external workers, like freelancers, contractors, and gig workers. These workers are often not effectively managed or integrated into talent management strategies which often lead to to missed opportunities and compliance risks. The concept of ""total talent management"" is introduced as a holistic approach that treats all workers as valuable contributors to the organization. This approach addresses the need for HR to actively manage the entire workforce due to social, economic, and legislative factors, including diversity and inclusion efforts and compliance requirements related to equal pay and misclassification.Story continuesHowever, balance is always the key. It must be noted that when individuals are presented with tasks that are either too easy or overly challenging, they tend to redefine their job roles to make them more engaging or manageable. This tendency can have detrimental effects on organizations, as it often results in jobs not fulfilling their intended purposes. To address this issue, it is important to conduct chartering conversations between managers and their subordinates. These discussions should aim to customize tasks to match each employee's capabilities and interests, and hence, ensure that the work remains both challenging and achievable. The Right Workplaces for Mentally Stimulating Jobs with a BalanceAmazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) are renowned for their rigorous interview processes which sets the stage for a workforce that thrives on intellectual challenges. Both companies are known to select candidates who exhibit exceptional problem-solving skills and creativity, ensuring that their employees possess the cognitive capabilities necessary for demanding roles.Once inside these tech giants, the work culture further fosters mental stimulation. Employees are encouraged to think critically and innovate, but also make independent decisions. The dynamic and fast-paced environment at Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) necessitates adaptability and continuous learning which keeps minds engaged and proactive in addressing complex challenges.From a financial perspective, both Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)  and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)  have reaped the benefits of this approach. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s advertising revenue, driven by its search engine and digital advertising platforms, has contributed largely its financial success.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) to keep employees stimulated involves employees' tours and travel, great food and among other things, a peer to peer recognition program powered by an internal software that lets employees nominate each other for a reward for handling a work-related problem. To read more about how Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) generates revenue through YouTube, check out our article on the highest paid youtubers in the world.  Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is also one of the top artificial intelligence companies in USA.25 Most Mentally Stimulating Jobs According to Redditlassedesignen/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of most mentally stimulating jobs according to Reddit, we exhausted Reddit’s discussion threads to shortlist the most relevant jobs.

(FCX) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-mcmoran-inc-fcx-attracting-130006361.html,1695387606,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this mining company have returned -3.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, which Freeport-McMoRan falls in, has lost 3.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.37 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +42.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $1.61 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -34%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.17 indicates a change of +34.7% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Freeport-McMoRan.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.61 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +12.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $23.08 billion and $24.33 billion estimates indicate +1.3% and +5.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryFreeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.9%. EPS of $0.35 for the same period compares with $0.58 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.65 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +25%.Over the last four quarters, Freeport-McMoRan surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Freeport-McMoRan is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

He later elaborated that cash is not safe because ""it will be taxed by inflation."" But as time passed, Dalio's view on cash has made a U-turn.""Temporarily, right now, cash I think is good ... and the interest rates are fine. I don't think it will be sustained that way,"" he said at the Milken Institute Asia Summit in Singapore last week.In the U.S., the Federal Reserve has implemented significant interest rate hikes to cool inflation. The federal funds rate is now at its highest level since 2001. For investors, some high-yield savings accounts are now paying over 5% annual percentage yields (APYs).Don't Miss:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes and you only need $100.Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession. Here are 3 high-yield options to add significant income to your portfolio.Dalio also told the audience what he doesn't want to own at the moment.""I don't want to own debt, you know, bonds and those kinds of things,"" he said.When asked about his approach to deploying capital, Dalio said that he would want to be ""in the right places"" geographically. He also emphasized the importance of diversification and paying attention to disruptions.As the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, Dalio knows about deploying capital. Here's a look at some notable investment themes in Bridgewater's portfolio.Emerging Market EquitiesDalio's investment horizon extends beyond U.S. borders.According to Bridgewater's latest Form 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Dalio's fund held 17,932,948 shares of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:IEMG) at the end of the second quarter. With the position valued at $883.92 million at the time, IEMG was the second largest publicly traded holding in Bridgewater's portfolio.Story continuesIEMG holds more than 2,700 stocks and provides exposure to a broad range of emerging market companies. Its top three holdings are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.Bridgewater also owned 7,848,503 shares of Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:VWO) at the end of June, a stake valued at $319.28 million.VWO is another ETF that gives investors access to emerging markets like China, India, Brazil and South Africa. It holds more than 5,000 stocks.In a MarketWatch interview published last October, Dalio said that opportunities will ""come in different regions"" over the next five years.""As we look at the world, we have to recognize that there are bright spots and there are less bright spots, and places like emerging Asia, places such as Singapore and Vietnam and Indonesia and places like that are bright spots,"" he said. ""India, I think, is going to be a brighter spot.""Consumer StaplesIn an era where artificial intelligence and cutting-edge technologies dominate the headlines, consumer staples may not seem like an exciting business on the surface.But Dalio still likes the segment.Bridgewater's third-largest publicly traded holding at the end of June was Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (NYSE:PG), a company deeply entrenched in the consumer staples business. With well-known brands like Tide, Bounty, Gillette and Pampers, the company offers a range of products that households buy regularly, allowing it to generate consistent revenue through thick and thin.Beverages are another part of the consumer staples category. And rather than choosing between Pepsi and Coke, Dalio is going with both.Bridgewater's Form 13F filing revealed that the firm held 2,566,566 shares of PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and 8,214,890 shares of Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) as of June 30, valued at $475.38 million and $494.7 million, respectively.It's easy to see why both companies can be resilient: Even in a recession, a can of Coke or Pepsi is still affordable to most people.Another reason many investors are attracted to consumer staples companies is their ability to pay reliable dividends.In May, PepsiCo announced its 51st consecutive annual dividend increase. Coca-Cola's board approved the company's 61st consecutive payout increase in February. Meanwhile, Procter &amp; Gamble has paid a higher dividend to shareholders for 67 years straight.Read next:Elon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

(NASDAQ:REGN) Shares Could Be 40% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regeneron-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaq-regn-120041871.html,1695470441,STORY,['REGN'],"[Key InsightsRegeneron Pharmaceuticals' estimated fair value is US$1,376 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityRegeneron Pharmaceuticals is estimated to be 40% undervalued based on current share price of US$825 Analyst price target for REGN is US$896 which is 35% below our fair value estimateHow far off is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.22bUS$4.41bUS$4.97bUS$5.58bUS$6.00bUS$6.35bUS$6.65bUS$6.91bUS$7.15bUS$7.37bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 7.43%Est @ 5.85%Est @ 4.74%Est @ 3.96%Est @ 3.42%Est @ 3.04% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$4.0kUS$3.9kUS$4.2kUS$4.4kUS$4.4kUS$4.4kUS$4.4kUS$4.3kUS$4.2kUS$4.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$42bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.4b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$188bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$188b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$104bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$146b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$825, the company appears quite good value at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Regeneron PharmaceuticalsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive.Additionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. Robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives.Amazon.com’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. However, inflationary pressure, geopolitical tensions and foreign currency headwinds remain concerns.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Sares of Boeing have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the year-to-date period (+5.0% vs. -15.6%). The company remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. During the second quarter, this jet giant booked 460 net commercial airplane orders and recorded a 10% hike in service revenues.A strengthening U.S. defense budget should also boost Boeing’s growth. The company holds a strong solvency position in the near term. However, Boeing expects supply-chain disruptions to continue to harm its operational results, at least in the near term.Further, the company has been incurring notable abnormal production cost in relation to production quality issues for 787 jets that may hurt its future results. Its dispute with Embraer over termination of the earlier made joint venture might cause Boeing to incur some loss in the future.(You can read the full research report on Boeing here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Regeneron shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the year-to-date period (+14.1% vs. -14.8%).  The company maintains momentum on asthma drug Dupixent’s stellar performance, driven by continued strong demand in the approved indications. Growth in Dupixent through additional label expansions and a promising late-stage pipeline set the momentum for further development.The approval of Libtayo for additional indications is likely to drive the drug’s sales and diversify the company’s portfolio. Additionally, the company received a significant boost with the FDA approval of a higher dose of aflibercept at 8mg.Regeneron has a deep pipeline and the development of additional drugs will be an incremental boost to the company. However, lead drug Eylea sales are under pressure due to increasing competition. A decline in Eylea sales will hurt Regeneron's performance.Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX), Altria Group, Inc.

335,413f2e1e-ecdb-38ce-b880-1de823fe49c9,UNP,2023-09-23,UAW strike: Why railroads could feel the impact too,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/uaw-strike-why-railroads-could-152101927.html,1695396061,VIDEO,"['F', 'CSX', 'NSC', 'GM', 'UNP', 'STLA']","[The autoworkers are continuing their strikes against the Big Three automakers, Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA). Most economists expect for there to be some ripple effects across the U.S. economy. One industry that could feel the impact is railroads. Cowen Senior Research Analyst Jason Seidl tells Yahoo Finance Live that ""autos have been one of the few brights spots"" for railroads in what has been an overall ""tough"" year for the industry. Seidl says he does expect the strikes to eventually start showing up in the railroad companies' numbers, though it's not being seen yet due to lags in the data.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: If the UAW strike becomes prolonged, the effects could span out to industries outside of autos. Joining us now with the impact we could see on rail, we've got Jason Seidl who is the Cowen senior research analyst. So just broad strokes, set the set the table for us here. What are some of those impacts that you're anticipating, based on any correlations that we could see overflow from the UAW strike right now?JASON SEIDL: Well, thanks for having me. So it's been a very tough year for the railroads. Volumes of have not been what everyone has hoped for. We're down about 4.5% on the year. And ironically, autos have been one of the few bright spots. We have double digit growth in automotive traffic for the railroads in 2023.So if you take that away, you're adding over a half a percentage point on the downward side, the total traffic for the rails. And so we are expecting this to eventually start hitting numbers. You're not seeing it yet, because there's a couple week lag in what you see in the numbers.The railroads already reported on a week lag, but there's also some finished vehicles on the ground that they can still move as we head into the strike here. But a prolonged strike, you're going to really get an impact for the railroads, and that's coming with a backdrop of just everything else putting pressure on them.Story continues- Yeah, certainly. And, Jason, as we're speaking right now, we're just getting the headline crossing that today at noon all parts distribution facilities here in for GM and Stellantis are being called to strike. When you take a look at where some of these locations will be, the strike for GM parts plants in Michigan, two locations there, strike of all US Stellantis part plants, that is according to sources here in terms of what we are seeing crossing Bloomberg right now. And Fein saying that GM, Stellantis still needs some, quote, ""serious pushing.""Now, they are continuing their strike against Ford, but they are not going to be expanding their strike with Ford. So, Jason, as we talk about some of the ripple effects and what you were just saying in terms of the lag effects that we could see for the rails, the longer that this goes on, how big of an impact could we see? If this is a strike that lasts, we're talking 30 days, potentially 45 days, which is what we just heard from our last guest.JASON SEIDL: We've already taken some of our numbers down yesterday to account for the slower-than-expected traffic that we've seen and maybe some minor impacts from the strike that we're seeing. Remember, total automotive exposure for the railroads is somewhere between 4% and 5%, depending upon the carrier, so it's not really large. But it's going to impact them, like I said, because you're already in an environment where the railroads have their own labor that are costs are going higher. Remember, when the railroad workers were about to strike, they got ordered back to work by Congress. But that was the most expensive rail labor contract in history, and the railroads have been around for a while. So you have that flowing through on the cost side.Additionally, on the cost side, you had some weather impacts here in the near term. And additionally, on the cost side, you're seeing fuel rise up. Fuel has dropped from January to July. But post the end of July, we've seen a big rise in fuel, and the rails get hit on that with about a 60-day lag on the recovery side. So near terms, the railroads have a lot of negative things going on, and unfortunately, very few positives these days.]"

This huge deal marks Cisco's most significant move to bolster its software business and leverage the surge in artificial intelligence.The deal is anticipated to close by the end of the third quarter in 2024. However, some analysts have expressed concerns about potential antitrust issues due to overlapping security businesses. If finalized, the Splunk acquisition would be Cisco's largest in nearly four decades.Strategic Move Away from HardwareThe acquisition looks to lower Cisco's dependence on its vast networking equipment sector, which has been beleaguered by supply chain disruptions and a post-pandemic decline in demand.Chuck Robbins, Cisco's CEO, emphasized the merger's focus on security and observability, two sectors where companies are less likely to cut costs due to the severity of cybersecurity threats, per Reuters, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. The stock has a good Growth score of “A” and moderate Value score of “C.”Inside Splunk's StrengthSplunk, which currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), specializes in data observability, aiding companies in overseeing their systems for cybersecurity threats. Operating on a subscription-based pricing model, Splunk's impressive clientele includes giants like Coca-Cola, Intel, and Porsche. Despite an impressive revenue growth spurt last year, Splunk faced a demand dip in 2023, mainly due to higher interest rates. The stock has a good Growth and Momentum score of “B.”Inside the Synergy of the DealCisco already has a data-security partnership with Splunk. This acquisition is likely to boost Cisco's revenue growth and gross margin in the subsequent fiscal year post-acquisition. Post-acquisition, Cisco expects an addition of $4 billion in annual recurring revenue. Should the deal collapse, Cisco would be obligated to pay Splunk a hefty termination fee of $1.48 billion.Story continuesInside the DealPreviously, merger discussions between the two tech giants were initiated but did not come to fruition. The current deal has Cisco paying $157 cash per Splunk share, a 31% premium to Splunk's recent closing price.
