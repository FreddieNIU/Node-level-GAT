Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Range Resources The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$796.0mUS$950.6mUS$928.7mUS$629.0mUS$605.2mUS$593.0mUS$588.5mUS$589.2mUS$593.5mUS$600.3mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ -3.79%Est @ -2.01%Est @ -0.76%Est @ 0.11%Est @ 0.72%Est @ 1.15% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.7% US$732US$805US$724US$451US$399US$360US$329US$303US$281US$262(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.6bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$600m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.7%– 2.2%) = US$9.4bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$9.4b÷ ( 1 + 8.7%)10= US$4.1bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$8.7b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$32.8, the company appears about fair value at a 12% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Range Resources as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.303. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Range ResourcesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

7,8d343d51-1139-3acd-ae0f-6b95a1ae6a09,TMO,2023-09-30,13 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-robotics-stocks-buy-200517569.html,1696017917,STORY,"['EMR', 'ROK', 'DE', 'ZBRA', 'SYK', 'SPLK', 'TER', 'ISRG', 'TMO']","[In this article, we discuss the 13 best robotics stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our discussion on the robotics industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy Now.According to Precedence Research, the size of the robotics industry stood at $72.2 billion at the end of 2022. The industry is predicted to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.7% from 2022 to 2032 to reach a size of $283.2 billion. Based on the product type of robots, traditional industrial robots dominate the market with a 52% market share in 2022. Meanwhile, collaborative robots or cobots are the fastest-growing product segment as they are designed to help people perform their tasks with a better level of precision and sophistication. In terms of components, the hardware segment accounts for 72% of the market share. The remaining 28% of the market share is captured by software and services segments. When it comes to specific industry applications, manufacturing takes the lead, accounting for a substantial 68% of the market's top-line share. In terms of geography, the Asia Pacific region generates the most revenue, with a share of 46% in 2022. Within the Asia Pacific region, China leads as it has a track record of being responsible for 50% of all global installations taking place in the region over the years.Robotics Industry's Growth ProspectsAccording to the International Federation of Robotics, unit sales of industrial robots compounded at an average annual rate of 7% from 2017 to 2022. Meanwhile, annual unit sales of robots increased by 5% YoY to reach 553,032 in 2022. Overall, in the manufacturing industry, the global density of robots stood at 151 robots per 10,000 employees, and the stock of industrial robots stood at 3.91 million. The IFR anticipates a 7% annual average growth rate in the next three years, which would result in annual installations of 718,000 units by 2026. One of the reasons for the strong demand for industrial robots is significant investments in car manufacturing facilities and the overall modernization of industrial facilities across various sectors. You can also check out the Top 10 Industrial Robotics Companies in the World here, which play pivotal roles in this dynamic industry.Story continuesAccording to Mordor Intelligence, there is a strong demand for industrial robots in the healthcare sector as well. As per the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the most hazardous jobs in the US are performed by employees in the healthcare sector, exposing workers to the highest rates of on-the-job illnesses and non-fatal injuries. According to estimates, there are already 6,000 robots worldwide that are performing one million surgeries annually. Another sector that is a strong end-market for the robotics industry is the building maintenance industry. As per the US Bureau of Labor, there are 2.38 million janitors and cleaners employed across the US, and companies spend around $60 billion annually on these services. This amount does not include the insurance payouts, which are substantial as well due to the risky nature of the job. The heightened risk factor is one of the primary reasons for a stronger demand for cleaning robots. Cleaning robots have already made significant headways in the consumer segment. Around 19 million robots that performed domestic tasks were sold during 2022, marking an impressive year-over-year (YoY) increase of 12% in the largest consumer robot category.The healthy growth outlook of the robotics industry can also be attributed to the global aging population, as the need for robots is expected to rise due to their increased requirement in assistance living and domestic healthcare services. According to the United Nations (UN), every sixth person in the world will be above the age of 65 by the middle of this century as opposed to one in 11 people currently. Meanwhile, in Europe, one in every fourth person could be older than 65 by 2050. The number of population above the age of 80 is anticipated to triple from 143 million in 2019 to 426 million in 2050. The Japanese government is already embracing the impact of an aging population and a shortage of skilled staff as it has announced funding to make up for a gap of 380,000 skilled employees by 2025.Investment Opportunities in Robotics and AutomationIn addition to investing in the best robotics stocks, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), investors can also gain broad exposure to themes of robotics and automation by investing in the 10 Best Robotics ETFs such as iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (NYSEARCA:IRBO).

8,5f3bbe32-93d5-3d0c-b4a3-a8387bdb45c7,TMO,2023-09-30,Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) Has A Pretty Healthy Balance Sheet,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-nyse-tmo-140034263.html,1695996034,STORY,['TMO'],"[The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific What Is Thermo Fisher Scientific's Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of July 2023 Thermo Fisher Scientific had US$33.8b of debt, an increase on US$30.1b, over one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$3.13b, its net debt is less, at about US$30.7b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Thermo Fisher Scientific's Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Thermo Fisher Scientific had liabilities of US$14.1b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$36.1b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$3.13b and US$9.49b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$37.6b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Story continuesGiven Thermo Fisher Scientific has a humongous market capitalization of US$196.8b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Thermo Fisher Scientific has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.9, which signals significant debt, but is still pretty reasonable for most types of business. However, its interest coverage of 14.4 is very high, suggesting that the interest expense on the debt is currently quite low. Shareholders should be aware that Thermo Fisher Scientific's EBIT was down 27% last year. If that decline continues then paying off debt will be harder than selling foie gras at a vegan convention. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Thermo Fisher Scientific can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Thermo Fisher Scientific recorded free cash flow worth 73% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewBased on what we've seen Thermo Fisher Scientific is not finding it easy, given its EBIT growth rate, but the other factors we considered give us cause to be optimistic. In particular, we are dazzled with its interest cover. When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about Thermo Fisher Scientific's use of debt. While we appreciate debt can enhance returns on equity, we'd suggest that shareholders keep close watch on its debt levels, lest they increase. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Thermo Fisher Scientific , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

LOUIS, September 29, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance, a subsidiary of U.S. Bank, and its community development entity (CDE) – USBCDE, LLC – received $55 million of New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) allocation from the U.S. Department of Treasury. The allocation is part of the federal government’s $5 billion NMTC program, which helps economically distressed communities attract private investment capital.USBCDE, LLC has now been awarded more than $1 billion in total allocations, one of only three CDEs to do so. It is one of 102 CDEs to receive a share of the NMTC allocation authority package announced by the Treasury’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund). The bank received its first award in 2006; this is its 13th allocation under the NMTC program; and the sixth year in a row it has received an award. Since its inception, USBCDE has invested more than $910 million in 46 states plus D.C., helping create more than 59,000 jobs and increasing the capacity served at community facilities like schools and health care centers by more than 1.9 million people annually.""These allocations of NMTCs are an important tool in helping to catalyze growth and build wealth in communities that have historically lacked access to capital,"" said U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance Managing Director of Community Finance Solutions Laura Vowell. ""We’re committed to investing in projects and with partners that prioritize increasing access to capital and helping to close the racial wealth gap.""Recent projects that USBCDE has financed with its allocation include:An expansion of the Lakota Tech High School serving members of the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. This project has two components: an addition to the existing building for additional classroom space as well as the construction of a new stand-alone automotive tech and welding training facility that will help Lakota Tech students learn skills that employers seek.Development of the Children’s Village at Lotus House, a multi-provider children’s resource center in Miami, serving women, families and children experiencing homelessness.Development of a community-owned grocery store and community space in Detroit, increasing access to healthy and sustainably grown foods while building community ownership and empowerment.The renovation of a long-vacant shopping center in Dellwood, Missouri, into a vital resource for the predominantly Black community that provides early childhood education, workforce development, co-working space, a restaurant, and a bank.Story continuesFee income collected through these projects is also reinvested. Impact Finance distributes it as grants to organizations with a racial equity focus and has provided $7.6 million to organizations and communities since 2013.In addition to being a vocal advocate for more equitable access to capital in the NMTC industry, Impact Finance has provided technical assistance, grant dollars and referrals for third-party support to several person of color-led CDEs to assist in completing the allocation application. USBCDE also deploys some of its own allocation to emerging and person of color-led CDEs through the intermediary CDE model – a partnership that helps the CDE build a NMTC track record, offers an opportunity to deploy this resource within their selected community and is a potential factor for success in gaining future allocation.Overall, about 20% of this year’s allocatees and allocation went to CDEs led by persons of color.""We’re happy to see with this round of allocations continued improvement in representation, particularly an increased representation in Native-led CDEs and investment in Native areas,"" Vowell said. ""We’re excited for all of the allocatees and look forward to helping support their success.""About U.S. BankU.S. Bancorp, with approximately 77,000 employees and $681 billion in assets as of June 30, 2023, is the parent company of U.S. Bank National Association.

At the same time, credit card spending declined in September, potentially signaling a slowdown in the fourth quarter.""What we are seeing is cracks in the consumer,"" Oliver Chen, senior research analyst at TD Cowen, said on Yahoo Finance Live.Chen pointed out several headwinds that are up against consumers.Inflation is still moving higher, albeit at a slower rate. Consumer prices were up 0.6% month over month in August and up 3.7% compared to last year. Then there are resuming student loan payments putting household budgets under pressure.Higher energy prices haven't helped either. On Friday, the national average gas price stood at $3.83 per gallon, per AAA, slightly off the 2023 high, though still below the recent peak of over $5 per gallon seen in 2022.And according to Chen, resilient shoppers who are still spending are choosing to purchase travel over goods. For retailers, this has all added up to weaker traffic in September.""What we found is that consumers are really feeling cautious,"" UBS analyst Jay Sole told Yahoo Finance Live. ""They're worried about things like having to repay student loans, and as a result, they're thinking that they're going to pull back on spending on discretionary items like apparel, footwear, and accessories, and we think that's going to be a headwind for stock prices.""In a recent Coresight Research consumer survey, the number of respondents who said they expected their personal financial situation to be better this holiday season compared to last year dropped. In August, the percentage of those who thought their situation would be better dropped to 18.8% from 34.2% in June.Coresight Research expects growth rates of around 1% to 1.5% in real retail sales and around 3% in nominal retail sales.Story continuesA shopper passes by a display of Christmas trees in a Costco warehouse as holiday shopping is underway on Thursday, Aug. 24, 2023, in Sheridan, Colo. (David Zalubowski/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Trends still 'good' at retail leaders Costco, WalmartYet, some retailers are going into the holidays with an optimistic tone.""Christmas is good,"" Costco (COST) CFO Richard Galanti said on the fourth quarter earnings call with investors about the retailer's early roll-out of holiday items. ""Everything from decor to trees to toys, that's starting off well so far. But it's new. It's in the last few weeks.""Similarly, a few weeks ago, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said at the Goldman Sachs Global Consumer Conference in New York City that he feels ""pretty good about where the consumer is in the US.""He added that the retail giant is ""encouraged by what happened going back to school. ... Normally, that means that holiday is going to be good, so I feel pretty good about the back half and our position in it.""McMillion also shook off any concerns about the overall US economy as the retail giant continues to gain share. In its second quarter results, Walmart posted same-store sales that rose 6.3%, more than the 4.04% expected, according to data from Bloomberg.On Yahoo Finance Live, Chen said both retailers are ones to watch.""We like market share leaders,"" he said. ""That includes Levi's. It includes Walmart and includes Costco and also LVMH. We think they're good places to be in this environment.""As far as deals go, Sole said consumers should be on the lookout — there ""absolutely"" will be promotions.""There's still too much inventory out there,"" he said. ""I think retailers have been surprised by how slow demand has been already this year, and that's created a little bit of a build-up of inventory. ... When there's too much inventory out there, that leads to promotions and discounts because that's what retailers have to do to sell it.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The regulators accused the company of charging higher prices to consumers in the United States, leaving a dent in the global image of Amazon.com (NASDAQGS:AMZN). Does This Provide an Opportunity to Startups?The real question here is how does this shape the future of e-commerce in the United States? Will customers continue trusting big names as their go-to marketplaces, or will this allow more companies to join the race and emerge in the industry? One such startup is ContextLogic Inc. (NASDAQ:WISH). Launched in 2011, the company is an e-commerce platform offering products at extremely affordable prices. On September 26, ContextLogic Inc.

Bill Zhang, VP of Global Logistics and China GM at Wish, stated:Story continues""Through our collaboration with PUDO Inc., we're enhancing the shopping experience for our customers. The partnership amplifies convenience by enabling hassle-free package retrieval from numerous locations. In parallel, it also opens up new avenues for independent retailers to drive increased foot traffic and revenue streams generated by package collections.""Prominent Names in the US E-commerce MarketWhile startups continue to bloom, some companies have established trust among consumers in the United States because of their product quality and incomparable customer service.

On August 29, Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY) reported earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2024. The company reported earnings per share of $1.22 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.14. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $9.58 billion and was ahead of market consensus by $65.26 million.eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is a leading marketplace and e-commerce company based in the United States. With the fall season approaching, companies like eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) understand that they must significantly invest in empowering sellers to gain large monetary benefits. On September 27, the company published a ""Seller's Updates"" report for the coming fall. According to the report, sellers will benefit from an extensive update in the listing and promotion category. Not only will all sellers have access to a social page, but they will also be able to send offers in bulk on the eBay app. Additionally, AI-powered tools will tremendously enhance the efficacy of sellers in listing products.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the covered call strategy and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Stocks for Covered Calls. What is a Covered Call Strategy?A covered call strategy is an options trading strategy where an investor holds a long position in a specific stock or other underlying asset and simultaneously sells a call option on that same asset. The objective of this strategy is to generate income from the premiums received from selling the call option while potentially benefiting from the stock's price appreciation up to a certain point.The covered call strategy has gained attention because it has historically provided appealing returns when considering the level of risk involved. The CBOE S&amp;P 500 BuyWrite Index (BXM), a benchmark index designed to track the performance of a hypothetical covered call strategy, is often said to offer similar average returns as the S&amp;P 500 Index but with about two-thirds less volatility, according to a paper published by CFA Institute. The index has delivered an 8.29% return to shareholders since the start of the year and its 12-month return came in at 11.78%, as of September 22. The report also mentioned that the covered call strategy has gained attention among investors over the years. In the 10 years that ended June 2014, the assets managed using these strategies have grown by over 25% each year.Another Goldman Sachs study from January 2012 looked at 16 years of covered call trading (from 1996 to 2011) and found that using covered call strategies improved returns and reduced risk in diversified portfolios. The advantage amounted to a 3.6% annual increase in returns and a 20% decrease in the variability of monthly returns. This improvement was based on selling covered calls that were 10% out-of-the-money and had a one-month duration on S&amp;P 500 stocks with readily tradable options. In addition to this, the study discovered that writing call options on large-cap companies was more effective than on small-cap companies. However, it didn't find a significant difference in results between value and growth stocks.Story continuesThe popularity of this investment approach is evident in the success of the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI), the largest covered call exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, with assets totaling $26.8 billion. It has not only attracted the most new investments of any actively managed ETF this year but has also become the largest actively managed ETF overall. According to VettaFi’s data, $9.7 billion has been invested in JEPI ETF this year so far. One of the main reasons for this huge inflow is that JEPI is structured to hold a ""defensive"" portfolio of stocks, further minimizing risk.Given the current market situation with continuous interest rate hikes and growing inflation, analysts advise investors to add defensive stocks to their portfolios and sell call options on these defensive securities. Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, spoke about the strategy in his interview with the Financial Times. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Covered call strategies really started to gain traction with investors last year when there was more downside in the market . . . they were a way for investors to get above average income without taking on undue risk.”For a covered call strategy, investors should consider established, large-cap, and blue-chip stocks that have a history of stability and are less likely to experience extreme price fluctuations. Some of the best stocks for covered calls include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). In this article, we will discuss some other best stocks for covered calls.What is a Covered Call? 10 Best Stocks For Covered CallsSource:PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we selected the best stocks for covered calls based on hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. The companies mentioned below are blue-chip stocks with a history of performing well over the long term. Moreover, these companies also pay dividends to shareholders.

Here is what the firm has to say:Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential operated by a superb management team that has been successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation. In recent quarters, industrywide sales have retrenched slightly, driven by record lumber deflation, moderation in DIY discretionary demand (particularly with big-ticket items), a mix-shift from large to smaller Pro-specific projects, and a general trend of consumers reallocating budgets from goods to services. Sales remain elevated relative to 2019 baseline levels driven by a combination of price and mix, while units have largely normalized. Against this backdrop, Lowe’s headline same-store-sales growth has been modestly negative, offset by material margin expansion and the benefits of Lowe’s best-in-class share buyback program positioning the company to generate roughly flat earnings growth in 2023.

But the e-commerce company has attracted an onslaught of competitors over the years. Nearly everyone, from mass retailers Walmart and Amazon to, more recently, specialized rivals like Vestiaire Collective and retailers like Michaels and David’s Bridal, is chipping away at its dominance.While eBay remains the largest online marketplace, with $74 billion worth of goods sold on its site in 2022 (and 1.7 billion listings), that volume was 15% below 2020. As a result, eBay CEO James Iannone, who conceded the site can’t just be an “everything” store, has focused eBay more sharply on a few core sectors, notably luxury.To do that, eBay recently began testing a new consignment service that connects users with vetted sellers who list and sell high-end items, initially only designer handbags from certain brands like Valentino and Hermès. EBay has also extended its “authenticity guarantee” program to streetwear, so trained U.S. authenticators can verify brands like Fear of God and Kith.Iannone, who became CEO of eBay in 2020 after time at Walmart, Sam’s Club, and Barnes &amp; Noble (where he launched the Nook e-reader meant to challenge Amazon’s Kindle), says trying to be all things to all people hurt eBay. The digital auction site’s share of the U.S. e-commerce market fell to 3.5% in 2022 from 4.7% two years earlier, according to Insider Intelligence.“We had become too much of a one-size-fits-all marketplace, and our customer satisfaction was lagging, so we picked focus areas,” he tells Fortune. Those areas have included luxury, streetwear, and auto parts.This interview was edited and condensed for clarity.Fortune: There’s been a boom in luxury resale sites, and eBay is now dipping its toes into this market. What does a marketplace like yours have to offer customers compared with the likes of Vestiaire Collective, The RealReal, or Grailed? We’re really the pioneers of resale e-commerce. EBay has been where people can unlock value in used, pre-loved, and refurbished items. We added authentication to build a new, game-changing level of trust on the platform. It helps protect buyers who, say, are buying a handbag, then will spend more on the site outside of bags. We also bought Certilogo [in July], which tags luxury apparel and makes tracking the product’s sustainability easier, making it more desirable in the resale market.Story continuesYou have also dipped your toes in consignment, an area The RealReal and others saddled with inventory when items don’t sell find challenging. What’s the rationale?We are working on making it so easy to sell that you don’t need to go to a consigner: for instance, our “magical listing” feature, where we do all the heavy lifting for the seller to list their products. [The tool uses AI to analyze data provided by the seller, extrapolate information, and create a blurb, simplifying the listing process.] It’s a small test for us but one we can use to say whether we can do consignment economically.Speaking of AI, can it help make sure thieves can’t use eBay to unload stolen goods ransacked from a Nordstrom or a museum heist?Part of why we acquired a company like Certilogo was to be able to track authenticity. It’s also part of why we acquired authentication centers. We’re very good at working with law enforcement and regulators to ensure everything on the site is safe, not stolen or counterfeit goods. We use very advanced AI to help us do that and recognize the telltale signs. We’ve made a lot of investments to keep eBay a clean, well-lit marketplace. [Editor’s note: The U.S. this week sued eBay for allowing the listing of items that violate environmental laws. An eBay spokesperson told Fortune that the “actions are entirely unprecedented, and eBay intends to vigorously defend itself.”]What role do brands play in making sure goods on resale sites are real?We just launched a couple of new programs, like a certified-by-brand program where the products are certified by that brand, since we have brands selling directly to consumers on our site, like Adidas. Others include Best Buy, Sonos, and Milwaukee Tool.There is much more competition for marketplaces like yours than a few years ago. There are, of course, Amazon and Walmart, the luxury resale sites like Vestiaire, but even retailers like Michaels. What is eBay’s moat against all this?The first thing is scale. We have access to 190 countries and 132 million buyers, making it easy for someone to come on as a consumer or a seller. We have a lot of what I call accidental entrepreneurs. Such people didn't set out to build a small business on eBay. We offer cross-category shopping, where people come looking for an item in one category and start shopping in another. So if you look at some of these marketplaces that are one vertical, they don’t have the same kind of multiplier effect.You became CEO at a time when eBay was running low on steam. What did you see initially as problems to solve?Our first vector shift was to become more focused on not-in-season items. The company had been focused on new, in-season merchandise and was doing unhealthy things like buying traffic. So one of the first pillars I focused on was to support our core, meaning we should not be so hung up on newness and the latest in-season fashion. Small specialized competitors were coming up, wanting to steal market share from eBay. And the second was being obsessed with customers and making sure we listened to them. We had become too much of a one-size-fits-all marketplace, and our customer satisfaction was lagging, so we picked focus areas [like accessories, handbags, sneakers, and auto parts.]Earlier in your career, you spent time at Barnes &amp; Noble and Sam’s Club, both brick-and-mortar retailers. How has that informed how you run an e-commerce site?One of the benefits of being in retail is being in front of customers regularly. I would spend a lot of time walking stores at Walmart and meeting associates and shoppers. I’ve tried to bring that here to eBay. But we don’t have stores, so how do we do the same type of thing? One way is through events like we’re having tonight in Philadelphia to bring sellers together. At our offices, I spend a lot of time walking the floors and talking to employees. Walmart is very customer-obsessed, and I am bringing that to eBay and making sure we are even more customer-obsessed.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has likely pulled an extra $2.6 billion over that time frame, the equivalent of gaining an extra $30 million a day.Both nations, which are part of OPEC+, have agreed to slash their crude production along with rest of the cartel over the past year, in an attempt to eliminate price ""distortions"" in the oil market, one UAE official said.OPEC+ members initially cut production by 2 million barrels a day last October, causing oil prices to spike. Then, Saudi Arabia and Russia implemented their own voluntary production cuts this summer, with Saudi Arabia slashing production by 1 million barrels a day while Russia slashed production by half a million barrels a day. Those output cuts will be extended through the end of the year, both nations announced earlier this month.The effects of tighter supply have already started to be felt in the energy spot market, with oil prices now hovering near a 10-month-high. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded around $93 a barrel on Friday, while West Texas Intermediate crude traded around $92 a barrel.Analysts have said crude prices could quickly be on track to notch $100 a barrel next year, thanks to underinvestment and chronic undersupply in the industry.Higher oil prices could be a boon for both nations, with the money helping to fund Saudi Arabia's various lavish spending projects as well as Russia's war on Ukraine.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

The additional $11.5 million includes commitments from three new investors, in addition to increased commitments from the Ford Foundation and Tru-Capital Investment Fund, the general partner of the fund. This results in a &gt;40% increase in the fund's size to a total of $37.5 million.The fund's mission is to empower real estate developers who have traditionally lacked access to capital and support from conventional sources, including BIPOC and women-owned developers. Since its launch in 2020 with $26 million in initial capital from Morgan Stanley and the Ford Foundation, IDF has demonstrated its unwavering commitment to supporting developers focused on creating high-quality, affordable housing throughout the United States. With the infusion of an additional $11.5 million in capital, IDF is poised to have an even greater impact on underserved communities and promote equitable access to real estate development opportunities.The newly added investors to IDF include the Kresge Foundation and Carver Bancorp, Inc., both esteemed organizations recognized for their dedication to community development and social impact. This expansion of the investor pool speaks to the fund's growing reputation as a vehicle for transformative change.Since its inception, IDF has been at the forefront of empowering real estate developers, having fully deployed its initial funds across five visionary investees dedicated to advancing affordable housing projects and are already seeing an impact on their businesses. Since IDF’s investments were made, these developers have secured over $130 million in additional operating or project financing. This funding has been instrumental in not only strengthening their financial standing but also in fueling their efforts to create sustainable, inclusive, and vibrant communities.Story continues""The expansion of the Impact Developers Fund is a testament to the power of collaborative efforts in achieving meaningful change,"" said James H. Bason, President and CEO at TruFund Financial Services, Inc. ""With the continued support of our valued partners, Morgan Stanley and the Ford Foundation, along with the inclusion of the Kresge Foundation and Carver Bancorp, Inc., we are now better equipped to drive positive social and economic outcomes through real estate development. This will empower even more visionary entrepreneurs and developers from underrepresented backgrounds to create lasting impact in their communities.""""As an anchor investor in the Impact Developers Fund, Morgan Stanley looks forward to continuing involvement with TruFund in supporting a thriving affordable housing development sector,"" said Joan Tally, Managing Director in Community Development Finance at Morgan Stanley. ""These investments will not only strengthen and support impactful companies but will also have a long-term positive affect on the residents of the apartments developed by the companies.""""Historically disadvantaged and underserved businesses, whether they are based in racially diverse and dynamic urban American or the beautiful rolling hills of rural white Appalachia, need equity capital. The CDFI industry was an innovative government creation to serve those businesses, but too few CDFIs have equity products. I applaud Morgan Stanley leaders James Gorman and Mike Mantle for seeing the need and addressing it,"" said Ford Foundation Head of Mission Investments Roy Swan. ""There are few more worthy investments than putting safe and affordable roofs over the heads of moms, dads, and children wherever they live in America. The return on investment is not just financial; safe and secure families are also more productive and engaged members of society.""""Kresge’s flexible equity capital will enhance the capacity of historically under-resourced developers, including BIPOC- and women-led and minority-led developers’ capacity to effectively grow their housing real estate portfolios,"" said Tosha Tabron, Social Investment Officer at The Kresge Foundation. ""IDF’s intermediary investment approach is critical to supporting emerging developers, who with the right capital, can scale their work in communities and be competitive in the market alongside established traditional and affordable housing developers.""""Carver’s investment in the Impact Developers Fund is a natural extension of our 75-year track record of driving change and supporting economic empowerment among traditionally underserved communities, including communities of color,"" said Michael T. Pugh, President and Chief Executive Officer of Carver. ""We are proud to support the Impact Developers Fund and its diverse group of real estate developers, which are making dreams a reality for many low-income individuals and families.""Through the dedication of all its stakeholders, the Impact Developers Fund is paving the way for increased equity and inclusion in real estate development. The fund's work not only addresses immediate housing needs but also ensures that the benefits of development extend to those who need it most.

We will also be navigating through the current market trends, major players and the top 20 renewable energy companies in the US based on revenue. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the Top 5 Renewable Energy Companies in USA by Revenue.The US Renewable Energy Industry: An AnalysisIn 2022, The International Trade Administration reported that the renewable energy industry in the United States is the second largest in the world, following China. The country produces more renewable energy than the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany combined. Renewable energy has penetrated across the US becoming a major part of the national energy mix. By mid-2030, renewable energy is expected to be the leading source of electricity generation in the country.The renewable energy market is segmented on the basis of the source used to derive energy. The main sources include solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal, and municipal solid waste. In the United States, renewable electricity is produced mainly from the wind. While hydroelectric sources are also consumed for this purpose, solar, biomass, and geothermal contribute in smaller proportions to the overall electricity production.Clean Energy Trends Shaping the Industrial LandscapeThe United States is undergoing a major transition towards cleaner sources of energy and carbon neutrality. The power generation from renewable energy has witnessed a rise with solar and wind power being the most adopted sources. On March 1, Bloomberg NEF reported that the investment in clean energy in the US in 2022 increased to $141 billion, up 11% year over year. Out of the total power generation in the country, renewable energy accounted for 41%. This shift from conventional sources of energy even continued during high inflation and interest rates associated with the commodities in the renewable energy sector throughout 2022.Story continuesExperts believe that government support, relevant legislation, federal permits, and reforms will be necessary to capitalize on the emerging clean energy market in the country. Considering the long waiting times which lasts for two to six years for most of the energy infrastructure projects to receive all state approvals, this is a major limitation to the energy transition in the country.Major Industry PlayersThe renewable energy market in the United States is quite fragmented. The major players in this market include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and the Southern Company (NYSE:SO)Headquartered in Florida, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is one of the major generators of renewable energy, from the sun and wind. On July 25, the company reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023.  The company reported earnings per share of $0.88, beating EPS estimates by $0.07. The company’s revenue for the second quarter amounted to $7.35 billion, up 41.79% year over year, ahead of revenue consensus by $1.18 billion.Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is a leading electric power and gas holding company in the United States. The company contributes to the trend of adopting sustainable energy sources in the country. The company has recently expanded its solar energy resources in Indiana. On June 22, the company reported that it has partnered with renewable energy developer, Ranger Power, to buy up to 199 megawatts of solar power from the Indiana-based Speedway Solar facility. The company will be buying this energy from the facility under a 20-year power purchase agreement. This project will generate enough energy to power more than 37,000 homes and is expected to be operational by 2025.Another leading player in the US renewable energy market is the Southern Company (NYSE:SO). Being an energy provider, the company is one of the largest owners of renewables in the United States. The company operates a fleet of solar, wind, and biomass facilities across the U.S. On September 27, the company reported that it has acquired the South Cheyenne Solar Facility which is a 200-megawatt solar project in Colorado. This acquisition enabled the company to expand its renewable energy portfolio.Thus, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and the Southern Company (NYSE:SO) continue to transform the state of energy transition in the United States.

Shares have lost about 8.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Salesforce.com due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Salesforce Beat on Q2 Earnings, Raised GuidanceSalesforce reported better-than-expected second-quarter results and raised guidance for the full fiscal 2024.The enterprise cloud computing solution provider’s second-quarter non-GAAP earnings increased 78% to $2.12 per share from $1.19 reported in the year-ago quarter. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.90. The robust year-over-year bottom line was mainly driven by higher sales and the benefits of ongoing cost-restructuring initiatives, which include the trimming of the workforce and a reduction in office spaces.Salesforce’s quarterly revenues of $8.60 billion climbed 11% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.52 billion. The top line also improved 11% in constant currency.Salesforce has been benefiting from the resilient demand for its cloud and business software offerings in an uncertain macroeconomic environment as customers are continuing with their major digital transformation. The strong second-quarter top-line performance also reflects the benefits of its go-to-market strategy and sustained focus on customer success.Additionally, the company’s initiative to integrate artificial intelligence into its offerings like Slack and the launch of a generative AI-enabled Einstein GPT product also boosted the demand for its solutions during the reported quarter.Quarterly DetailsComing to CRM’s business segments, revenues from Subscription and Support (93% of the total revenues) increased 12% from the year-earlier period to $8 billion. Professional Services and Other (7% of the total sales) revenues increased 3.5% to $597 million. Our second-quarter revenue estimates for Subscription and Support, and Professional Services segments were pegged at $7.83 billion and $680.8 million, respectively.Under the Subscription and Support segment, Sales Cloud revenues grew 12% year over year to $1.90 billion. Revenues from Service Cloud also improved 12% to $2.05 billion.Marketing &amp; Commerce Cloud revenues jumped 10% to $1.24 billion. Salesforce Platform and Other revenues were up 11% to $1.64 billion. Also, revenues from Data increased 16% year over year to $1.19 billion.Our estimates for Sales, Service, Market &amp; Commerce, Platform &amp; Other, and Data Cloud services second-quarter revenue were pegged at $1.82 billion, $1.97 billion, $1.2 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.14 billion, respectively.Geographically, Salesforce registered revenue growth of 10% in America (67% of the total revenues), 20% in the Asia Pacific (10%) and 13% in the EMEA (23%) on a year-over-year basis.Salesforce’s gross profit came in at $6.49 billion, up 16% from the prior-year period. Moreover, the gross margin improved 300 basis points (bps) to 75%.Salesforce recorded a non-GAAP operating income of $2.72 billion, highlighting an increase of 77% from the year-ago quarter’s level of $1.54 billion. Moreover, the non-GAAP operating margin expanded 1,170 bps to 31.6% from 19.9% in the year-ago quarter due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of total sales. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to 58% from 69% in the year-ago quarter.Story continuesBalance Sheet &amp; Other DetailsSalesforce exited the fiscal second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $12.4 billion, down from the $14 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter.CRM generated operating cash flow of $808 million and free cash flow of $628 million in the second quarter.

The company bought back shares worth $1.95 billion in the second quarter and $4 billion during the first half of fiscal 2024. With this buyback of shares, the company has now approximately $7.9 billion remaining under its current authorization limit of $20 billion.Strong Guidance for Q3 and FY24Salesforce provided strong guidance for the third quarter and raised the outlook for fiscal 2024. For the fiscal third quarter, Salesforce projects total sales between $8.70 billion and $8.72 billion (midpoint $8.71 billion), indicating 11% year-over-year growth.The company expects a $100 million impact on third-quarter revenues from foreign currency exchange rates. Furthermore, CRM anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share in the band of $2.05-$2.06 for the current quarter.For fiscal 2024, Salesforce raised the revenue guidance range to $34.7-$34.8 billion from the previous forecast in the band of $34.5-$34.7 billion. The company continues to expect no impact from foreign currency exchange rates.Salesforce now projects fiscal 2024 non-GAAP earnings between $8.04 and $8.06 per share instead of the $7.41-$7.43 per share band anticipated earlier. The company raised its fiscal 2024 estimates for the non-GAAP operating margin to approximately 30% from 28% expected previously. Moreover, it now anticipates operating cash flow to increase 22-23% year over year in fiscal 2024, up from the earlier projection of 16-17% growth.Salesforce’s upbeat guidance for fiscal 2024 reflects the benefits of the company’s recent price hike and the resilient demand for its solutions despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. In July 2023, CRM announced a price hike across its core products — Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Industries and Tableau — by an average 9%, effective from August 2023.The hike marked Salesforce’s first product price increase in the last seven years.

The company's longtime CEO is Katzman's father, investor David Katzman, who provided the seed money to launch SmileDirectClub.SmileDirectClub went public on Sept. 12, 2019, pricing its IPO at $23 a share for a market cap of $8.9 billion. In perhaps a foreshadowing event, the stock opened below its IPO price at $20.55. By the close of trading, shares had finished down close to 11%.Since its tepid market debut, SmileDirectClub has sought to expand into new products such as teeth whitening, overnight retainers, and lip balm amid fierce competition for clear aligners with Invisalign maker Align Technology (ALGN).But despite the promising aligner technology and consumer products push, SmileDirectClub has dealt with a series of challenges that have made profits elusive.In February 2020, an investigative story run by NBC News called into question the safety of SmileDirectClub’s trademark clear aligners. The story focused in on various consumer complaints about tooth damage from wearing the aligners.Story continuesThe company sought to battle back from that but has since been met with brutal supply chain inflation and more cautious consumers.

This move is part of a series of transactions made by the insider over the past year, during which Whitehead has sold a total of 362,818 shares and made no purchases.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 13 Warning Signs with IRM. Click here to check it out. MRO 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MROMarathon Oil Corp is an independent exploration and production company primarily focusing on unconventional resources in the United States. The company operates in two segments: United States and International. The majority of its production is sold to refiners, marketers, and integrated oil companies.The insider's recent sell has raised questions about the company's current valuation and future prospects. To understand the implications of this move, it's essential to analyze the relationship between insider transactions and the stock's price.Executive VP and CFO Dane Whitehead Sells 50,000 Shares of Marathon Oil CorpThe insider transaction history for Marathon Oil Corp shows a trend of more sells than buys over the past year. There have been 17 insider sells and 0 insider buys in total. This could indicate that insiders believe the stock is currently overvalued, prompting them to sell their shares.On the day of the insider's recent sell, shares of Marathon Oil Corp were trading at $27.63, giving the company a market cap of $16.202 billion. The price-earnings ratio stands at 8.44, lower than both the industry median of 9.34 and the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. This suggests that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers and its own historical standards.Executive VP and CFO Dane Whitehead Sells 50,000 Shares of Marathon Oil CorpHowever, the GuruFocus Value, which is an intrinsic value estimate based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates, suggests a different picture. With a price of $27.63 and a GuruFocus Value of $28.44, Marathon Oil Corp has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.97, indicating that the stock is fairly valued.In conclusion, the insider's recent sell, coupled with the trend of more insider sells than buys over the past year, could be a signal of caution for potential investors. However, the company's lower-than-average price-earnings ratio and its fair valuation according to the GuruFocus Value suggest that the stock might still hold potential for value investors.

45,a17f9489-4e10-38a3-a4d4-7d9a1bdaa674,MRO,2023-09-30,Pick These 4 Low P/CF Stocks to Uplift Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pick-4-low-p-cf-122400080.html,1695990240,STORY,"['ATGE', 'MRO', 'SEM', 'ENS']","[Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Select Medical Holdings Corporation SEM, EnerSys ENS, Marathon Oil Corporation MRO and Adtalem Global Education Inc. ATGE boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Story continuesThe Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the six stocks that qualified the screening:Select Medical Holdings, one of the largest operators of critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and occupational health centers, carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Select Medical Holdings’ current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 4.2% and 56.9%, respectively, from the year-ago period.

TDS has vouched to significantly improve its rural broadband connectivity to continue receiving Enhanced Alternative Connect America Cost Model (E-ACAM) support from the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”). The company has decided to honor this pledge in all the 24 states where it operates.The E-ACAM mandates carriers to deploy broadband speed of at least 100/20 Mbps in rural areas to be eligible for funds. TDS, in particular, is required to deploy high-speed Internet facilities to more than 270,000 locations, about 40% of which would be in unserved addresses not receiving federal support. In addition to long-term investments in rural broadband capabilities, the initiative aligns network deployment requirements with the federal Broadband Equity Access &amp; Deployment (BEAD) program, which funds projects to help expand high-speed Internet access and use.TDS has been part of this initiative since its inception in 2016. Telecom service providers were previously required to deploy speeds of 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps upstream. The improved speed mandate is based on the exponential growth of data-intensive applications and is likely to help bridge the digital divide between urban and rural regions.Headquartered in Chicago, IL, TDS is a diversified telecom service provider offering wireless and wireline services in the United States. The company operates through three segments — U.S. Cellular, Wireline and Cable. It owns 82% of U.S. Cellular, a leading wireless operator in the country subscriber-wise, serving 5 million customers in 21 states.TDS is looking for opportunities to bring more fiber for better services, in its current footprint and adjacent areas. By leveraging fiber, the telco is trying to respond to customers' growing TV and broadband service demand. The company is making investments to increase fiber deployment by expanding fiber and other technologies in its existing markets and overbuilding in new markets. All these investments have strengthened its fiber-based broadband networks. Such strategic moves underscore the company’s efforts to diversify its business from a telecom service provider to a fiber network provider.TDS presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

48,2a69efd1-d451-36b3-ac47-1a4557d51ae9,MSFT,2023-09-30,11 Best Cybersecurity Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-cybersecurity-stocks-hedge-115525550.html,1696074925,STORY,"['S', 'ZS', 'FTNT', 'SPLK', 'AKAM', 'MSFT', 'RPD']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 best cybersecurity stocks hedge funds are buying. To skip our detailed analysis of the cybersecurity industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Cybersecurity Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying.Interest and Investments In Cybersecurity On The RiseCybersecurity has become a major concern for governments and corporations alike as the prevalence of cyber attacks and breaches has steadily been rising. Governments are becoming increasingly involved in the cybersecurity discourse because of an overall desire to protect national economies from competitors abroad. With wide ranging allegations of economic espionage by way of cyber attacks being made throughout American history, particularly in relation with China, it is evident that the US government considers the cybersecurity of its top companies of utmost importance. Even apart from governmental concerns, companies themselves feel the need to invest in cybersecurity to ensure the safety of not only precious trade secrets, but also employee and customer identities. As a result of these factors, we have been seeing an overall rise in corporate investments flowing towards the cybersecurity sector.A report published by Moody's on September 28 highlights how cyber budgets in major companies have been steadily growing in light of a higher prevalence of cyber attacks and breaches in recent years. The report mentions that between 2014 and 2020, in particular, the number of cyber breaches rose exponentially - although they do seem to have ""plateaued"" since then. The greatest prevalence of reported cyber attacks between 2013 and 2022 was seen in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, however, this does not mean that the Americas were any less impacted by this plague.Are Cybersecurity Stocks An Investment Worth Considering?In light of these developments, the Moody's survey found that between 2019 and 2023, companies and organizations grew their spending on cybersecurity by 70%. Among these respondents, corporates were reported to have increased their cybersecurity budgets the most - by 100%. At the same time, the report also highlighted the fact that those who were not insured for cyber attacks are now beginning to rush for this insurance. This is resulting in projections stating that the global cyber insurance market will grow to about $33 billion in premiums by 2027, as compared to its current value of about $12 billion in premiums.Story continuesAnother interesting thing to note in the report is how organizations are seemingly only focused on basic cybersecurity measures at the moment - sometimes referred to as ""cyber hygiene."" This is because many companies do not have the budget to implement more advanced security measures, which can put them at a disadvantage relative to other corporations that are willing to go the extra mile. However, the existence of pricier, more advanced cybersecurity solutions also means that as organizations become more aware of all the risks associated with cyber breaches, they will be further incentivized to make even bigger investments in their cybersecurity, all to the advantage of cybersecurity providers.All of these developments go to show that the cybersecurity market is set to benefit from immense growth in the near future, especially as awareness of the risks of cyber breaches and attacks is also on the rise. As a result, companies heavily invested in the cybersecurity industry, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), SentinelOne, Inc. (NYSE:S), and Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS), are expected to profit immensely as more individuals, corporations, and governments sign on for their cybersecurity products and solutions. Investors can thus benefit from keeping a close eye on cybersecurity stocks in the market today, particularly those being backed by influential hedge funds and institutional investors. Since this is appearing to be an area of rapid growth in investments, now is the right time for investors to enter this space by adding a few exceptional cybersecurity stocks to their portfolios.

Wall Street sure thinks so. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) is up 26% year to date thanks to the frenzy over AI-related stocks.But AI's big breakout comes at a cost: much more energy.Take for example OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT. Research done at the University of Washington shows that hundreds of millions of queries on ChatGPT can cost around 1 gigawatt-hour a day, or the equivalent energy consumed by 33,000 US households.""The energy consumption of something like ChatGPT inquiry compared to some inquiry on your email, for example, is going to be probably 10 to 100 times more power hungry,” Professor of electrical and computer engineering Sajjad Moazeni told Yahoo Finance.Industry participants say this is only the very beginning of what's to come.“We’re maybe at 1% of where the AI adoption will be in the next two to three years,” said Arijit Sengupta, founder and CEO of Aible, an enterprise AI solution company. “The world is actually headed for a really bad energy crisis because of AI unless we fix a few things.”An energy-hungry Facebook data center under construction. (George Frey/Getty Images) (George Frey via Getty Images)Data centers are the heart of the advanced computing process. They are the physical locations with thousands of processing units and servers at the core of the cloud computing industry largely managed by Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.""As you think of this shift towards these larger foundation models, at the end of the day you’re going to need these data centers to require a lot more energy as a whole,"" Angelo Zino, VP and senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Yahoo Finance.Data centers have increasingly shifted from using simpler processors, called CPUs, to more advanced graphics processing units, or GPUs. Those components, made by companies like Nvidia (NVDA), are the most energy intensive.""For the next decade, GPUs are going to be the core of AI infrastructure. And GPUs consume 10 to 15 times the amount of power per processing cycle than CPUs do. They’re very energy intensive,” explained Brady Brim-Deforest, CEO of Formula Monks, an AI technology consulting company.Story continuesAdded Brim-Deforest: ""Energy consumption is going to dramatically increase on a global scale, simply because of the energy-intensive nature of AI. But if you look at the nuances, what's interesting is AI is also incredibly efficient at things that humans are not as efficient at.""'Huge massive infrastructure cost'Research done by Benjamin C. Lee, professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Pennsylvania, and professor David Brooks of Harvard showed that data center energy usage grew 25% a year on average between 2015 and 2021. This was before generative AI grabbed national headlines and ChatGPT usage skyrocketed. Meanwhile, US Energy Information Administration data revealed an annual growth rate in renewable deployment of 7% during the same period, though that number is expected to increase with initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act.“There’s already this fairly large gap between the growth rates, between data center energy, and renewable energy deployments,” Lee told Yahoo Finance.“We call it cloud computing; it feels like there’s no cost associated with it,” said Lee. “There’s a huge massive infrastructure cost.”To counteract such consumption, the major cloud providers like Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services all invest in renewable energy to match their annual electricity consumption. They hold net-zero pledges, meaning they remove as much carbon as they emit.Microsoft's Azure has touted its 100% carbon neutral status since 2012 and says that by 2030 it will be carbon negative. Amazon has said it expects to power its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, as part of its goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. For its part, Google aims to achieve net-zero emissions across all of its operations by 2030.""Net zero doesn’t mean you’re carbon-free potentially. There will be hours of the day where you don’t have enough sun or enough wind, but you’re still going to be drawing energy straight from the grid at whatever mix the grid will provide to you,"" said Lee.He is studying ways in which data centers can shift or reschedule their computation based on the availability of carbon-free energy.""Maybe you compute much more in the middle of the day when there's a lot of solar energy and you compute much less in the middle of the night,"" said Lee.It's no surprise, then, that the energy usage challenge has created a crop of companies aimed at creating more efficient ways of using AI models.""We can literally cut down energy use ... in these [types] of AI workloads by one-third by just moving to serverless,"" Aible's Sengupta told Yahoo Finance, describing a technology that uses server resources on demand for more efficiency.Analysts point out that reducing costs will naturally drive the industry towards energy solutions.“Whether it’s because of emissions or financial efficiencies or investor pressure or anything else, we do see companies looking more at how to be more efficient. It’s an operational cost. The more efficient you are, the lower your operational cost,” says KPMG's US climate data and technology leader Tegan Keele.As Zino of CFRA Research pointed out, the winners in the space are the data center operators. ""The actual data usage and how all this comes together is going to be more concentrated to a couple of companies out there,"" said Zino.""More and more companies are essentially renting space in the cloud rather than kind of investing and building their own data centers, just because in the future I think it's going to be a lot more costly in nature,"" he added.Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

To skip our detailed analysis of the nature and scope of the generative AI industry in 2023, go directly and see 10 Greatest Classical Music Composers of All Time.According to the McKinsey Global Survey, 2023 has been nothing short of a breakout year for generative AI. Less than one year since generative AI stocks like NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have had their moment in the sun, one-third of McKinsey's survey respondents admit using generative AI tools like Bard and ChatGPT in at least one business function. To read about more companies which are currently dominating the generative AI market in 2023, check out our coverage of the 18 Biggest Generative AI Companies In The World. Amid recent strides, AI has risen from a topic delegated to tech employees to one of the primary concerns of top business leaders in the world;  25% of surveyed C-suite executives admit to personal use of generative AI in daily business operations. Furthermore, more than 30% of respondents from companies have said that generative AI is of utmost priority on their boards' agendas. More interestingly, 50 percent of survey respondents have claimed that their companies are likely to substantially increase investment in AI overall due to the resounding success of generative AI tools in modern business practices. According to McKinsey, organizations which have already integrated company operations with AI capabilities have generally been the first to explore the potential of generative AI, and companies which are already basking in the profits generated by traditional AI are already outpacing competitors in their adoption of gen AI tools. Although the expected business disruption due to the rampant adoption of generative AI is more than substantial, respondents are also anticipating workforce cuts in certain areas and undergoing massive reskilling efforts to address changing organizational dynamics. Story continuesCan AI Imitate the Greatest Classical Music Composers of All Time?Despite the fact that generative AI is postulated to become a $1.3 trillion industry by 2032 at an astonishing CAGR of 42% according to Bloomberg, the complete nature and scope of its utility is still something that experts have not exactly figured out. However, in light of the recent SAG-AFTRA strikes, employees in the music industry are contemplating the future of their employment with respect to the advent of generative AI capabilities. They constantly find themselves wondering whether gen AI can imitate the best screenplay writers or musical composers. It would be pertinent to note that the concept of using generative AI to imitate the greatest classical music composers of all time is hardly a new phenomenon, as the history of algorithmic composition can be traced back to about 500B.C. In that time period, ancient Greek philosopher and music theorist Pythagoras expounded the intricate relationship between mathematics and music. From the 11th to the 14th centuries, music theorists like Guido d'Arezzi and Franco of Cologne established strict regulations for music notations, including but not limited to the time values of single notes, pitches, and rhythms. According to an article by NBC, due to this intricate interconnection between music and mathematics, the rules that govern the pitch and harmonic progression in classical music are fundamentally programmable and interpretable to generative AI as well. Algorithmic analyses imitate the process of human-composed classical music, which is then developed into motifs of more sophisticated melodies and themes, articulating a coherent and comprehensive form of classical music.According to an article by The New York Times, R.A.V.E. is an excellent example of machine learning, a classification of AI technology which composers have experimented with since the early 90s. But in the face of rapid development, the arrival of publicly available, AI powered music tools and the dominating influence of high-profile initiatives by large tech companies like NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), R.A.V.E. is now able to reconstruct its input, compress audio signals it receives, and extract the salient features of the sound to resynthesize it in its entirety. R.A.V.E. has since been used in concerts around the world. According to The Washington Post, the technology has gone far beyond the mere reconstruction of classical music. Generative AI is swiftly becoming part of popular culture. In 2019, TikTok's parent company ByteDance acquired AI music platform Jukedeck, that created tools to let users significantly resynthesize music to match videos. In 2020, Shutterstock Inc. (NYSE:SSTK) purchased assets of Amper, which auto-generated music based on specific criteria like mood, length, tempo and instrumentation. However, according to an article by The Washington Post, although AI music is now slowly finding its way into the mainstream, the tailwinds associated with generative AI in music are not likely to be long lasting. According to composer Tod Machover:""This technology is generating infinite music that isn’t actually composed by anybody, and that’s a terrible, scary, awful way of thinking about where music could go. I mean, really, it’s the worst kind of elevator music.""For Machover, the human touch is infinitely integral to music. He postulates that AI represents a way to exponentially enhance access to music and creative tools for making it and that it cannot imitate the works of some of the greatest classical music composers of all time. Machover's work has largely focused on the creation of what he terms ""hyperinstruments"" which tend to use sensors, signal processors, and software to enhance the musical power of performers, all the while building interactive musical instruments for nonprofessional musicians. He argues that generative AI tools for music today merely use machine learning to sift through archives of data to discern patterns and textures. However, its grasp over the complexities and emotiveness of music is still arbitrary. Like other generative AI tools by companies like NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), these systems can imitate music in limited ways as they do not know much about music in general.How are Music Companies Navigating Generative AI?In February 2023, an AI song entitled ""Heart on My Sleeve"" which imitated the voices of certain popular music celebrities went viral on Spotify Technology's (NYSE:SPOT) music platform. Soon after taking it down, the company's CEO explained in a BBC interview that the legitimate use of generative AI included tools which improved music, much similar to auto-tune. However, music companies like Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have clarified that the use of generative AI systems to impersonate and imitate the greatest classical music composers of all time and other artists will not be permitted on the platform. In keeping with this announcement, in April 2023, Spotify and Apple Music removed dozens of songs which used generative AI capabilities to clone the vocals of different artists. To know more about how leading music streaming platforms are navigating through different technological advancements, check out our article on the 15 Most Popular Music Streaming Services.Amid strong opposition from certain artists like Hozier, music streaming companies like Spotify Technology S.A.(NYSE:SPOT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have admitted to taking a nuanced approach. They have announced that there will be no blanket ban on music generated by artificial intelligence if the use of AI in music is deemed to be valid. However despite this announcement, Spotify Technology S.A.(NYSE:SPOT) has since decided to pilot a feature which will leverage the company's generative AI capabilities to translate podcasts into different languages while retaining the voice of the speaker. As music companies Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) deliberate over the incorporation of generative AI in their operations, it presents huge potential for companies investing in gen AI like NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META).Our MethodologyTo compile our list of the 50 greatest classical music composers of all time, we decided to undertake a consensus based approach by acquiring data from a variety of different credible sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). We picked composers that appeared at least twice in these sources, assigning them a cumulative score based on the numbers at which they appeared on the lists. For example, if a composer was ranked at number 5 on one list and number 6 on another, we gave them a total score of 11. Some of the criteria we considered for inclusion in the list were originality, influence, craftsmanship, and enjoyability. We then ranked all the entries based on their cumulative scores, from highest to lowest. Where there was a tie, we broke it based on the frequency at which a composer appeared in our research.To watch for companies which are diverting great investments in generative AI in order to capitalize on the industry's major upside potential, check out our coverage of the Top 10 Generative AI Companies to Invest In.50 Greatest Classical Music Composers of All Time50.

For more companies, head on over to Top 5 Cloud Computing Companies in USA.Cloud computing is one of the hottest buzzwords in the tech market today. But where did this word come from? Some accounts believe that the word dates back to 2006, when the big tech companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Google at that time, began using “cloud computing” to define a new segment of computer software services and file management across the Web. According to the MIT Technology Review, the term “cloud computing” was first used in 1996 at the offices of Compaq Computer, when tech executives were designing the future of the internet, calling it “cloud computing.” Nevertheless, the world got to know more about this technology when companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) began to push cloud computing efforts. One of the first articles covered on cloud computing was on November 15, 2007, when The New York Times reported the headline “I.B.M. to Push ‘Cloud Computing,’ Using Data From Afar.” The article addressed the beginning of internet-based supercomputing. Market OutlookCloud computing is one of the largest segments in IT and it continues to grow considering the increasing demand for cloud products and services across industries, institutions, companies, and governments.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis on the changing status of Greece and moving to the country, go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Greece. The Changing Status of GreeceAccording to CNBC, the interest of foreigners in the Hellenic Republic’s Residency by Investment scheme almost doubled in 2022, with a total of 2,767 requests registered by the Greece Ministry of Asylum and Migration. Requests registered, as of 2021, were around 1,521. 63% of the total number of requests since the effectiveness of this scheme has been from Chinese citizens. Moreover, wealthy internationals from the United States have also been increasingly interested in the Golden Visas of Greece.The last two years have also seen the country putting in a comprehensive legislative framework of tax incentives. The purpose of this framework has been to attract new tax residents and investments to the country. The framework encompasses four distinct laws, each catering to specific demographics: non-domiciled tax residents, foreign retirees, digital nomads, and family investment offices of high-net-worth individuals. Ever since, the government has received more than 1,000 applications from retirees and foreign professionals from 21 countries to declare their tax residency in the country.This program also aims to complement Greece's visa program, namely the Golden Visa program, and has been successful in doing so. To date, the program has attracted more than 9,000 individual investors from abroad.“As shown by the data for the first period of implementation of the new provisions, despite the adverse circumstances of the pandemic, the impact of the new tax incentives is extremely encouraging,” said Finance Minister Christos Staikouras. The minister added further that “Greece, moving forward with planning, vision and confidence, is recovering strongly from the health crisis, developing and is open to attracting investments and human capital.”Story continuesReal estate prices and costs of living in the country are some of the lowest in the European Union, another plus for those looking for the cheapest places to live or retire in Europe. The country has been doing quite well economically, and businesses and investors are increasingly interested in the country. 2022 saw the country's debt-to-GDP ratio decreasing by 20%, reflecting growth, fiscal adjustment, and high inflation. Greece is also emerging as a dynamic source of solutions for countries such as the US, extending its influence beyond energy diplomacy and defense to encompass high-tech innovation, healthcare, and green energy.Foreign Investments in GreeceBetween 2021-2022, the US was the 8th largest source of foreign investment in the country. Prominent examples of investments made in the country include AWS, Cisco, Deloitte, Digital Realty, Google, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Meta, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). Together, these investments aim to make an impact worth billions of dollars over the next few years.“We have seen many American companies, from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Meta, making large investments in Greece,” said US Ambassador to Greece, George Tsunis. ""Right now, even more American companies are coming to invest in our shared future, in recognition of talents present in Greece and the great potential,"" he added, referring to investments in the fields of technology, 5G optic fibers, energy, tourism, and shipping.In particular, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has unveiled its ambitious €1 billion investment blueprint for Greece. The plan aims to open three data center buildings, new well-paying high-tech jobs, and train over 40,000 workers across both the public and private sectors. Meanwhile, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has also been expanding its global footprint by opening their operations center in the country. Pfizer Inc.

Analysts at Raymond James upgraded Trimble (TRMBL) shares to ""outperform"" after the company announced it was selling $2 billion worth of tech assets to AGCO (AGCO).

The shares higher today following a Bloomberg report that the company is considering a former Cigna Group executive, Tim Wentworth, to be the next CEO. Walgreens has been searching for a new chief after it announced the abrupt departure of Rosalind Brewer from the position earlier this month. And Ros Brewer had really tried to beef up Walgreens, sort of broader health care bona fides to compete against CVS. CVS has been sort of the clear leader in that area. Wentworth, obviously, coming from an insurer, and he had been at Express Scripts as well-- might be the one to help Walgreens further in that direction.- Yeah, and then Rosalind, so when she departed, of course, that was an abrupt departure. It took a lot of people by surprise. She did try to move them into, as you said, kind of a bigger player in the health care space, acquire the urgent care providers, but that stock, Julie, of course, has been a mess. I mean, it's down about 40% so far this year. But maybe investors taking some page of optimism here. Maybe they get a tested veteran in there into the C-suite, changes some things.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Yeah, that seems to be what it is, a little relief there being felt in the shares.- Yep, for sure. All right, shares of Trimble and AGCO in focus. That's following news that AGCO will acquire an 85% stake in Trimble's agricultural products business. Companies say the joint venture is meant to better serve farmers worldwide with mixed fleet precision agriculture solutions. Trimble also hired today on the back of an upgrade from Raymond James to outperform from market perform. We have the AGCO CEO coming on later, excited about that interview.Lots of questions for him. What does it mean for competition in the marketplace, I think is a huge one. What's it really mean for farmers? And also his stock, Julie, has not been a performer. It's down about 10% for this year. So also just interesting to get his take on what gets investors excited again about owning that name.JULIE HYMAN: Right, and the buzzword here is precision agriculture, right, is how can farmers be more efficient with what they are doing. Precision agriculture has a lot to do with using technology in order to get the best yield from farms. And I've spoken to Eric Hansotia, the CEO of AGCO, before. And that's one of the things he's already emphasized. And now this Trimble acquisition of these assets is aimed at further improving that. It's interesting that Trimble itself is rising for a second day after this acquisition.And Raymond James pointing to what they say is their long-term favorable thesis on the stock and the evolution to a, quote, ""more software recurring revenue centric mix."" They also talk about less cyclicality for Trimble, which is interesting, because that's also one of the things that AGCO talked about as being a benefit of this deal. So that's something else that we can ask the CEO about.- Can't wait for that interview. That's a good one.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, should be good. And then another-- speaking of another interview that we're looking ahead to and another mover that we're watching, Carnival shares in the red today after the company reported third quarter earnings. The cruise line topping expectations, but fourth quarter guidance looking like a concern for investors.The company said it does expect a wider than expected loss of between $0.10 and $0.18 a share in the final quarter of the year, part of that having to do with fuel costs going higher. We've been hearing that a lot from the airlines as well. Obviously, when oil goes up, translates into all kinds of higher costs for companies that depend on the fuel.- Yeah, remember, this one, too, has been a rocket ship. So a lot of good news was priced in there. But yeah, I mean, it was the guidance, your adjusted EBITDA guidance 800 to 900, and the Street was closer to 950. Challenges like those higher fuel costs for sure weighing on there.]"

One such stock that merits attention is Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA). The stock, which is currently priced at 21.99, recorded a gain of 5.19% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 21.74%. The stock's fair valuation is $45.94, as indicated by its GF Value.Deciphering the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with WBA. Click here to check it out. WBA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of WBAThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapScrutinizing the Risk FactorsHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Walgreens Boots Alliance should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.72. These indicators suggest that Walgreens Boots Alliance, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesUnderstanding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Walgreens Boots Alliance: A Company OverviewWalgreens Boots Alliance is one of the largest retail pharmacy chains in the U.S., with over 8,500 locations. Nearly three quarters of Americans live within five miles of a Walgreens location. Roughly two thirds of revenue is generated from prescription drug sales; Walgreens makes up 20% of total prescription revenue in the U.S. Walgreens also generates sales from retail products (general wellness consumables and its own branded merchandise), European drug wholesale, and healthcare. With more locations incorporating additional services like Health Corner and Village Medical, Walgreens creates an omnichannel experience for patients and positions itself as a one-stop healthcare provider.Is Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapDecoding Walgreens Boots Alliance's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of Walgreens Boots Alliance's Altman Z-score reveals Walgreens Boots Alliance's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress. The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Walgreens Boots Alliance's historical data, 2021: 0.38; 2022: 0.42; 2023: 0.34, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Walgreens Boots Alliance's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.Assessing Operational EfficiencyThe EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Walgreens Boots Alliance's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.03; 2022: 0.07; 2023: -0.05) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that Walgreens Boots Alliance might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.When it comes to operational efficiency, a vital indicator for Walgreens Boots Alliance is its asset turnover. The data: 2021: 1.44; 2022: 1.48; 2023: 1.43 from the past three years suggests a recent decline following an initial increase in this ratio. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. Therefore, a drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in Walgreens Boots Alliance's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.Walgreens Boots Alliance: A Potential Value Trap?Given the analysis, Walgreens Boots Alliance, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. The company's declining Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio, EBIT to Total Assets ratio, and asset turnover ratio, along with its low Altman Z-Score, suggest potential financial distress and operational inefficiencies. Therefore, investors need to consider these risk factors and conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

65,83f4cc3e-6045-332d-bfd4-ca920528cfb2,SYY,2023-09-30,Read This Before Considering Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) For Its Upcoming US$0.50 Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/read-considering-sysco-corporation-nyse-121346422.html,1696076026,STORY,['SYY'],"[It looks like Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Sysco investors that purchase the stock on or after the 5th of October will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 27th of October.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.50 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.00 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Sysco has a trailing yield of 3.0% on the current share price of $66.05. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Sysco's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether Sysco can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for Sysco Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Sysco paid out more than half (56%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 48% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Sysco earnings per share are up 5.1% per annum over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. If management lifts the payout ratio further, we'd take this as a tacit signal that the company's growth prospects are slowing.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Sysco has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.0% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpIs Sysco worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share growth has been modest and Sysco paid out over half of its profits and less than half of its free cash flow, although both payout ratios are within normal limits. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy Sysco today.In light of that, while Sysco has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for Sysco that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

We will also be navigating through the current market trends, major players and the top 20 renewable energy companies in the US based on revenue. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the Top 5 Renewable Energy Companies in USA by Revenue.The US Renewable Energy Industry: An AnalysisIn 2022, The International Trade Administration reported that the renewable energy industry in the United States is the second largest in the world, following China. The country produces more renewable energy than the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany combined. Renewable energy has penetrated across the US becoming a major part of the national energy mix. By mid-2030, renewable energy is expected to be the leading source of electricity generation in the country.The renewable energy market is segmented on the basis of the source used to derive energy. The main sources include solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal, and municipal solid waste. In the United States, renewable electricity is produced mainly from the wind. While hydroelectric sources are also consumed for this purpose, solar, biomass, and geothermal contribute in smaller proportions to the overall electricity production.Clean Energy Trends Shaping the Industrial LandscapeThe United States is undergoing a major transition towards cleaner sources of energy and carbon neutrality. The power generation from renewable energy has witnessed a rise with solar and wind power being the most adopted sources. On March 1, Bloomberg NEF reported that the investment in clean energy in the US in 2022 increased to $141 billion, up 11% year over year. Out of the total power generation in the country, renewable energy accounted for 41%. This shift from conventional sources of energy even continued during high inflation and interest rates associated with the commodities in the renewable energy sector throughout 2022.Story continuesExperts believe that government support, relevant legislation, federal permits, and reforms will be necessary to capitalize on the emerging clean energy market in the country. Considering the long waiting times which lasts for two to six years for most of the energy infrastructure projects to receive all state approvals, this is a major limitation to the energy transition in the country.Major Industry PlayersThe renewable energy market in the United States is quite fragmented. The major players in this market include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and the Southern Company (NYSE:SO)Headquartered in Florida, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is one of the major generators of renewable energy, from the sun and wind. On July 25, the company reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023.  The company reported earnings per share of $0.88, beating EPS estimates by $0.07. The company’s revenue for the second quarter amounted to $7.35 billion, up 41.79% year over year, ahead of revenue consensus by $1.18 billion.Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is a leading electric power and gas holding company in the United States. The company contributes to the trend of adopting sustainable energy sources in the country. The company has recently expanded its solar energy resources in Indiana. On June 22, the company reported that it has partnered with renewable energy developer, Ranger Power, to buy up to 199 megawatts of solar power from the Indiana-based Speedway Solar facility. The company will be buying this energy from the facility under a 20-year power purchase agreement. This project will generate enough energy to power more than 37,000 homes and is expected to be operational by 2025.Another leading player in the US renewable energy market is the Southern Company (NYSE:SO). Being an energy provider, the company is one of the largest owners of renewables in the United States. The company operates a fleet of solar, wind, and biomass facilities across the U.S. On September 27, the company reported that it has acquired the South Cheyenne Solar Facility which is a 200-megawatt solar project in Colorado. This acquisition enabled the company to expand its renewable energy portfolio.Thus, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and the Southern Company (NYSE:SO) continue to transform the state of energy transition in the United States.

67,dd890118-a224-36fd-8fd8-e5f3dd487b92,ADM,2023-09-30,The Renewable Energy Revolution Is Here: Goldman Sachs Suggests 3 Green Stocks to Buy,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/renewable-energy-revolution-goldman-sachs-185213887.html,1696013533,STORY,"['GS', 'GPRE', 'DAR', 'ADM']","[The energy landscape is constantly evolving, and today we are witnessing a significant shift.The latest edition of Goldman Sachs’ Carbonomics report outlines the likely mid- to long-term course of America’s shale revolution. This report examines the technological advancements in exploration and extraction that transformed the US into a net oil exporter by 2018. Written under the leadership of the 5-star analyst Michele Della Vigna, the report elucidates the maturation and concluding phases of the shale industry.Della Vigna goes on to lay out how renewable energy tech has the potential to unlock as much as double the energy scale of the shale revolution – and to make possible some $3 trillion in energy infrastructure investment by 2032. The analyst points out several supportive factors that will boost clean energy technology through the end of this decade, with a particular focus on the $1.2 trillion in government subsidies and incentive funding laid out in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.In the Goldman view, the flood of Federal cash and the huge return potential for this ‘third American energy revolution’ make now the time for investors to start looking closely at green energy stocks. The firm’s analyst, Adam Samuelson, is on the job, recommending the stocks that will lead the charge into the new energy economy of the next decade.We’ve used the TipRanks platform to pull up the details on three of his picks – it turns out all are rated as ‘Strong Buys’ by the analyst consensus. Let’s dive in.Darling Ingredients (DAR)First up on the list is Darling Ingredients, a food industry company with an interesting connection to renewable fuels. Darling works on the recycling side of the food industry, collecting and processing edible by-products and food waste to create useful, sustainable products and renewable energy. The company operates over 260 facilities on five continents, gathering and repurposing approximately 15% of the waste generated by the global meat industry.Story continuesThis gathered waste is processed into collagens, fertilizers, pet food ingredients, and useful animal proteins and meals. On the energy side, Darling’s operation can generate green energy in the form of renewable diesel. These value-added products bring a host of benefits, chiefly the reduction of potentially dangerous waste clogging up landfills and other disposal facilities. Darling’s largest footprint is in North America, where it has more than 170 locations; the company also operates 50+ facilities in Europe and has smaller operations in Asia, South America, and Australia.Of particular interest to green energy investors is Darling’s partnership with the Texas-based petro-fuel company Valero. The two firms have a 50/50 agreement to operate Diamond Green Diesel, the world’s lowest cost and highest ‘green premium’ producer of renewable biodiesel. The company, also known as DGD, has been expanding due to increased demand for low-carbon alternative fuels and increased government regulations mandating lower carbon footprints and higher renewable levels. During the second quarter of this year, DGD saw record renewable diesel sales of 387.8 million gallons and realized an average EBITDA per gallon of $1.28. For 2023 as a whole, the venture’s sales have totaled 643.3 million gallons, with a $1.17 average EBITDA per gallon.For Darling as a whole, 2Q23 saw the company bring in $1.75 billion in total revenues. While up 6% year-over-year, this figure missed the forecast by $100 million. Darling’s bottom line, the EPS of $1.55 per share, was 1 cent below expectations.Goldman Sachs’ Adam Samuelson doesn’t hesitate to recommend this stock, despite the earnings miss. He sees the renewable biodiesel business as a key attraction, and writes, “We continue to believe DAR remains a uniquely advantaged, integrated low-CI feedstock and renewable diesel producer, with the shares offering a compelling entry point at 7.5x 2024E EV/EBITDA and &gt;10% FCF yield. We expect both of these factors to come increasingly in focus over the next 6-12 months as steady DGD distributions drive a sharp inflection in parent FCF, deleveraging, and ultimately accelerating cash returns, while industry-wide RD expansion accelerates feedstock demand for the parent business and puts a spotlight on DGD’s margin advantage versus peers.”Samuelson goes on to give the stock a Buy rating with a $102 price target indicating potential for an increase of a strong 95% in the coming year. (To watch Samuelson’s track record, click here)Overall, the Strong Buy consensus rating on Darling is unanimous, based on 9 positive Wall Street reviews of the stock. The shares are priced at $52.07 and their $95.78 average price target implies a one-year gain of 84%. (See DAR stock forecast)Green Plains (GPRE)Next up on our list is Green Plains, a company in the bio-refining field, developing and producing low-carbon biofuels that can power our existing transportation network while also reducing tailpipe emissions. The company’s operations extend to industrial alcohols, corn oils, animal feeds, and pet foods as well, making Green Plains a well-diversified firm in the realm of biorefining organic products and waste.Green Plains has extensive operations in the US Plains states and in the Mississippi Valley, and its 10 biorefineries, in the states of Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, and Tennessee, are capable of processing more than 300 million bushels of corn annually. The net product includes over 1 billion gallons of low-carbon biofuels, including ethanol, of which Green Plains is one of North America’s most important producers. The company also produces over 290 million pounds of renewable corn oils every year, and some 2.5 million tons of distillers grains and ultra-high protein products.Our technological and industrial economy has an insatiable appetite for fuels, and Green Plains has a ready market for its products. Meeting that demand in the last quarter reported, 2Q23, the company showed a top line of $857.6 million. This result was down from $1.01 billion in the prior-year quarter but came in $52.2 million above the estimates. At the bottom line, Green Plains’ EPS was a net loss, of 89 cents per share, a result that was 79 cents per share worse than expected and compared unfavorably to the 73-cent net EPS profit reported in 2Q22. The company notes that second-quarter earnings in 2Q22 received a heavy boost from a one-time USDA pandemic relief payment of $27.7 million.Goldman’s Samuelson sees Green Plains holding a solid position, despite y/y volatility in revenues and earnings, with its high capacity for generating useful low-carbon renewable fuel feedstocks. Demand for these products, and Green Plains’ other useful biofuel feedstocks, in his view, should provide support going forward.“GPRE has ~1bn gallons of ethanol capacity (~6% of US capacity), which we believe to be a key feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production to take off, through the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology. In addition, the company offers a multifaceted growth agenda pivoting around a lower carbon footprint, including corn oil production (low-carbon feedstock for renewable fuels) and clean sugar and protein technologies,” Samuelson noted.These comments back up Samuelson’s Buy rating on GPRE shares, while his $39 price target implies an upside of ~30% in the next 12 months.Zooming out, we find a Strong Buy consensus rating on this stock, supported by 8 recent analyst reviews that include 6 Buys and 2 Holds. The shares are priced at $30.06 and have a 32% one-year upside potential based on the average target price of $39.57. (See GPRE stock forecast)Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM)Last on our list of Goldman biofuel picks is the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, better known by its ADM initials. This is an agribusiness with a global footprint, operating in the production of both human and animal nutrition. In addition to working on healthier food products, ADM is also focused on improving our environment, through the development of plant-based substitutes for petroleum products.ADM’s global business is composed of several segments, including human nutrition, animal nutrition, pet nutrition, and industrial biosolutions. These cover most of the feasible uses for the world’s large-scale farm crops, and can even make use of the crops’ agricultural waste products. The company’s work aims to make agriculture, at all scales, more productive and more sustainable, with direct access to the food processing industry and global supply chains.The important point here is ADM’s industrial solutions segment, which includes an important biodiesel component, with strong demand both domestically and on the international export market. ADM supplemented this in its last reported quarter, 2Q23, with increased production of food oils, increased South American production of agricultural food products, and increased demand for softseed products that partially offset lower demand for soybeans and their derivatives.Overall, this diverse business, with its massive global footprint, makes ADM a giant among the world’s agricultural companies. The firm has a market cap of $40 billion, and realized over $101 billion in revenues last year. In its last reported quarter, 2Q23, ADM’s top line came to $25.2 billion, a result that was considered a bit disappointing, as it was down 7.7% y/y and missed the forecast by $520 million. The company’s earnings result, a non-GAAP EPS, was more upbeat; at $1.89 per share, the EPS figure was 30 cents per share better than had been anticipated.Checking in again with Goldman analyst Adam Samuelson, we find him upbeat on this company’s varied product lines and markets, and their inherent profit potential. Samuelson writes of ADM, “We see a favorable industry operating environment across the majority of ADM’s upstream value streams, notably underpinned by sustained expansion in vegetable oil demand for renewable diesel, coupled with solid execution, supporting results at-or-above the high end of the company’s $6-7 2025 EPS target range over the next two years.”Looking ahead from here, Samuelson gives ADM a Buy rating with a price target of $102 suggesting an upside of ~36% for the coming year. (To watch Samuelson’s track record, click here)All in all, this stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 7 recent Buys from the Street’s analysts, along with 2 Holds. The average price target here is $100.78, implying a gain of nearly 34% from the current $75.12 trading price.

68,c4be589e-c45a-388e-bb2d-6d85d82f047f,SNPS,2023-09-30,Why Is Salesforce.com (CRM) Down 8.3% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-salesforce-com-crm-down-153009035.html,1696001409,STORY,"['CRM', 'SNPS']","[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Salesforce.com (CRM). Shares have lost about 8.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Salesforce.com due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Salesforce Beat on Q2 Earnings, Raised GuidanceSalesforce reported better-than-expected second-quarter results and raised guidance for the full fiscal 2024.The enterprise cloud computing solution provider’s second-quarter non-GAAP earnings increased 78% to $2.12 per share from $1.19 reported in the year-ago quarter. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.90. The robust year-over-year bottom line was mainly driven by higher sales and the benefits of ongoing cost-restructuring initiatives, which include the trimming of the workforce and a reduction in office spaces.Salesforce’s quarterly revenues of $8.60 billion climbed 11% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.52 billion. The top line also improved 11% in constant currency.Salesforce has been benefiting from the resilient demand for its cloud and business software offerings in an uncertain macroeconomic environment as customers are continuing with their major digital transformation. The strong second-quarter top-line performance also reflects the benefits of its go-to-market strategy and sustained focus on customer success.Additionally, the company’s initiative to integrate artificial intelligence into its offerings like Slack and the launch of a generative AI-enabled Einstein GPT product also boosted the demand for its solutions during the reported quarter.Quarterly DetailsComing to CRM’s business segments, revenues from Subscription and Support (93% of the total revenues) increased 12% from the year-earlier period to $8 billion. Professional Services and Other (7% of the total sales) revenues increased 3.5% to $597 million. Our second-quarter revenue estimates for Subscription and Support, and Professional Services segments were pegged at $7.83 billion and $680.8 million, respectively.Under the Subscription and Support segment, Sales Cloud revenues grew 12% year over year to $1.90 billion. Revenues from Service Cloud also improved 12% to $2.05 billion.Marketing &amp; Commerce Cloud revenues jumped 10% to $1.24 billion.

Cowen’s analyst Robert Moskow recently said that some food companies are in early stages of an upcoming cyclical decline amid weakening elasticity of demand from supply chain normalization, the risk of price discounting, and margin pressures.However, the analyst said that in the current scenario, he’s tilting towards some top quality food companies that sell “must have” brands. He also likes these companies because of their pricing power. These companies include Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM), Hershey (NYSE:HSY), Utz Brands (UTZ), and Lamb Weston (LW).For this article we decided use a broader definition of the food sector and also expanded our scope to the beverage sector.

We would expect identical sales without fuel to be slightly negative in the second half of the year. As a reminder, this guidance reflects the effect of Express Scripts, which is reducing our reported identical sales without fuel by approximately 150 basis points in 2023.Despite slowing sales, as demonstrated in our year-to-date results, we believe we have the flexibility within our model to navigate the impact of this environment through effective cost management and growing alternative profits. We are maintaining our adjusted net earnings per diluted share and adjusted net operating profit guidance and would expect adjusted EPS to be in line with the prior year in the third quarter and slightly ahead of the prior year in the fourth quarter before including the approximately $0.15 benefit at the 53rd week. Kroger delivered another quarter of consistent results built on the foundation of record growth over the past three years.

In fact, if you look at the movement data through airports, it’s up year-over-year. Now it’s only back to pre-pandemic levels, but it’s quite a bit year-over-year. So that would kind of corroborate that thinking. So that’s the second reason. And the third is, there’s probably as we’ve seen another kind of recession — we’re at a consumer recessionary period, even though technically we’re not in a recession, consumer behavior trying to economize, and so that may be going into smaller sizes and things like that, which in the very short-term, [detox] (ph) a pantry, but people aren’t eating less, and we don’t anticipate that they will eat less.In fact, what I would say is, as consumers start to get squeezed, what generally happens is people move more at home. And now the cost of eating out is roughly four times what it is eating at home and so as consumers get more squeezed and as people get into their normal routines in the fall, we would think that at-home eating would probably pick up a little bit. We’ll find out. But that’s what we think and those are the three factors that is very clear to us are driving the current environment.”Read the full earnings call transcript here. Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Food Stocks To Buy Now.Suggested articles:15 Biggest Agricultural Companies in the US10 Best Regional Bank ETFs10 Best Infrastructure ETFsDisclosure: None. 13 Best Food Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global adventure tourism industry, the companies catering to extreme sports, and how the dawn of sports cameras helped make extreme sports more popular, and go directly to 5 Most Popular Extreme Sports in the US. Extreme sports is a broad term used to describe any action or adventure sports that include a high dosage of risk, height, speed, natural challenges, and physical struggle. Considered an alternative to mainstream sports with their adrenaline-rushing thrills, extreme sports were popularized in the 1990s with lots of TV coverage, and they keep on expanding their fanbase with every passing year. Global Adventure Tourism Industry: Adventure tourism is a form of travel that involves spelunking, climbing, cycling, hiking, hunting, rafting, and others. This is a growing and dynamic sector of the tourism industry, with an increasing demand and supply of diverse and innovative adventure travel products and experiences. Adventure tourism has the potential to enhance the well-being and resilience of travelers and hosts, as well as to contribute to the sustainable development of destinations.According to Grand View Research, the global adventure tourism market size was valued at $282.1 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 15.2% during the forecast period. The major factors which are expected to boost this growth include increased government tourism promotion activities, higher investments in this sector by the states, and a strengthening trend for adventure sports on holidays. Another factor that is expected to have a significant impact is the increase of advertising via different digital platforms, such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and others, offering better travel deals.Companies Catering to Extreme Sports Adding a whiff of danger is not something every brand can afford to do – but for some, extreme sport sponsorship is the perfect way of engaging Gen Z and beyond. Story continuesMonster Energy, owned by the Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), struck extreme sports gold when they decided to form a partnership with the X Games. The brand basically turned Aspen into one enormous billboard for Monster Energy. From athletes to apparel, the name Monster was everywhere to be seen on the Aspen slopes back in January. Stocks of the Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) were held by 44 hedge funds in the Insider Monkey database at the end of Q2, with Broadwood Capital holding the largest stake of 9.31 million shares, valued at $534.94 million. After the beverage giant’s recent endeavor in the alcohol industry, Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) ranks among the 12 Best Alcohol Stocks to Own According to Hedge Funds. The New York-based DICK’S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE:DKS) is the largest sporting goods retailer in the U.S., and is listed on the Fortune 500. The company also caters to a range of outdoor sporting activities, including rock climbing, snowboarding, and even provides parachutes for daredevil clients wanting to spread their wings. DICK’S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE:DKS) continues to shift away from the Field &amp; Stream brand in favor of its House of Sport concept with the announcement of nine new House of Sport stores, significantly larger and more profitable versions of traditional Dick’s stores. House of Sport – an approximately 100,000-square-foot store –  differs from a standard Dick’s Sporting Goods store in that it provides not just athletic gear and apparel, but amenities such as athletic training facilities, rock climbing walls, batting cages and outdoor fields, and services for activities ranging from cycling to golf. DICK’S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE:DKS) ranks among the Stocks with Price Targets Recently Trimmed by Analysts. On August 24, the stock experienced an adjustment in its target price as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co recommended. In a notable market shift, the price target has been reduced from $144 to the revised target of $128. However, this adjustment in price target doesn’t appear to have influenced the analyst rating, which remains consistent at Neutral. Helping Make Extreme Sports More PopularThere is no shortage of brave extreme sports enthusiasts out there who inspire and impress with their daring and adventurous stunts. Now, thanks to the technological capabilities of sports cameras, everyone has the chance to experience the world through the eyes of these eccentric daredevils.There was a time not so long ago when BASE – an acronym that stands for the structures jumped from: building, antenna, span, and earth – was a solitary pursuit. You climbed a building or a cliff and you jumped strictly for the thrill of it. Today, thanks to GoPro, Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRO), the sport has practically gone mainstream, seen by millions on platforms like YouTube. GoPro, Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRO) isn't exactly a household name, but anyone who has spent a little time on YouTube is surely familiar with the thousands of snowboarding, surfing, and even skateboarding baby videos that its cameras produce. The technology company has changed the sports we watch, the way we watch them, and how we think about ourselves and communicate that to others, all the while managing to shake up stodgy institutions like the Olympics. Over the last decade, the International Olympic Committee has introduced a number of new highflying and fast-moving sports to its lineup. Several of them – like ski halfpipe, ski and snowboard slopestyle, and the snowboard parallel slalom – are the type of acrobatic sports favored by the GoPro-wearing and YouTube-loving X Games crowd. They’ve done it to keep up with the adrenaline-soaked obsessions of the youth audience.GoPro, Inc.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.27% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.47%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.14%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the airline had lost 13.86% over the past month. This has lagged the Transportation sector's loss of 4.76% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.86% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Southwest Airlines as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 26, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Southwest Airlines to post earnings of $0.50 per share. This would mark no growth from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $6.65 billion, up 6.95% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $1.96 per share and revenue of $26.3 billion, which would represent changes of +68.97% and +10.42%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Southwest Airlines. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 6.51% lower within the past month. Southwest Airlines is holding a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell) right now.Story continuesDigging into valuation, Southwest Airlines currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 13.86.

(NYSE:PM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 81% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Philip Morris International, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Philip Morris International?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Philip Morris International. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Philip Morris International's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Philip Morris International is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Capital Research and Management Company with 18% of shares outstanding. With 8.8% and 6.1% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 14 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance.

However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Philip Morris International Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$225m worth of shares.

General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 19% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored.

PM, which has been strongly committed to being a majority smoke-free company, highlighted its growth targets at its 2023 Investor Day on Sep 28. Management aims to generate more than two-thirds of its total net revenues from smoke-free products by 2030.Philip Morris unveiled its growth targets for the 2024-2026 period, which underscores its confidence in future prospects. This optimism is mainly rooted in the strength of the company’s leading smoke-free brands, IQOS and ZYN, along with constant innovation. PM foresees substantial opportunities for further expansion, both in the United States and overseas.Shares of PM were up about 3% on Sep 28. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 18.3% in the past year, outpacing the industry’s growth of 10.7%.Targets for 2024-2026Philip Morris offered its compound annual growth targets for 2024-2026. This includes organic net revenue growth of 6-8%, which takes into account increasing total shipment volumes. Adjusted operating income (OI) is likely to grow at a CAGR of 8-10% on an organic basis. Finally, management envisions adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to increase at a CAGR of 9-11%, excluding the impact of currency. This guidance assumes the current corporate income tax rates.Moving on, the company projects heated tobacco unit shipment volumes of 180-200 billion units for 2026, wherein nicotine pouch shipment volumes are likely to range from 800 million to 1 billion cans. Further, PM expects ZYN to fuel double-digit compound annual growth in net revenues and adjusted OI for the company’s total U.S. operations in the 2024-2026 period. This includes the impacts of IQOS investments.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA Look at Smoke-Free ProductsConsumers have been increasingly moving toward reduced-risk products (RRPs) or smoke-free alternatives, driven by the growing awareness of the health risks associated with traditional cigarette smoking. PM is progressing well with its business transformation, with smoke-free products generating 35.4% of the company’s net revenues in the second quarter of 2023.In this regard, the IQOS, PM’s heat-not-burn device, counts among one of the leading RRPs in the industry. These next-generation devices are backed by substantial scientific insights and research. The company expects such advanced and high-quality products to aid adult smokers in switching from traditional cigarettes to smoke-free options.In the second quarter of 2023, revenues from smoke-free products (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) jumped 35.3% to $3,101 million (up 18.3% organically). In the quarter, the company witnessed continued strength in IQOS performance, along with pricing power. Total IQOS users at the end of the second quarter were estimated at roughly 27.2 million (including nearly 19.4 million who switched to IQOS and stopped smoking).For 2023, management expects heated tobacco unit (HTU) shipment volumes of 125-130 billion units. HTU shipment volumes are likely to be about 31-33 billion units in the third quarter.Among other initiatives, Philip Morris became the majority owner of Swedish Match on Nov 11, 2022. Management expects a robust performance from Swedish Match’s existing operations in 2023 due to the expectations of strong ZYN volumes in the United States.Story continuesWrapping UpPhilip Morris has made remarkable strides in transitioning to a smoke-free future. The company has been focused on establishing a more sustainable growth model and playing a vital role in reducing tobacco harm. These unparalleled efforts seem fit in a world where more smokers are switching to smoke-free alternatives, leaving traditional cigarettes behind.

Recently, WU's 50-day simple moving average broke out above its 200-day moving average; this is known as a ""golden cross.""A golden cross is a technical chart pattern that can signify a potential bullish breakout. It's formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average breaking above a longer-term moving average, with the most common moving averages being the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.A successful golden cross event has three stages. It first begins when a stock's price on the decline bottoms out. Then, its shorter moving average crosses above its longer moving average, triggering a positive trend reversal. The third and final phase occurs when the stock maintains its upward momentum.A golden cross contrasts with a death cross, another widely-followed chart pattern that suggests bearish momentum could be on the horizon.Shares of WU have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 8.9%. Plus, the company is currently a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, suggesting that WU could be poised for a breakout.The bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account WU's positive earnings outlook for the current quarter.

Jennifer Schonberger here with the details. Jennifer.JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: That's right. The Senate Banking Committee announcing this morning that they will haul the CEOs of the nation's largest banks before that committee on December 6 here in Washington. Amongst those that will be on the hot seat later this year include JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon, Bank of America's Brian Moynihan, Citigroup's Janet Frazier, Goldman Sachs's David Solomon, and Morgan Stanley's James Gorman.Now, analysts expect the executives to really use this hearing to criticize the new Basel III capital requirements proposed by the Federal Reserve earlier this summer that would require banks to raise capital by some 16% in aggregate. Bank executives expected to argue that it will hurt credit availability and really push operations into the unregulated shadow banking system.Now, this is the third year in a row that Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown has called the CEOs before Congress here in DC. Brown saying in a statement, quote, ""It's our job to hold them accountable to their workers, to their customers, and to the American people.

She also thinks the economy can avoid a recession and achieve that so-called soft landing.And she also made some comments on Citigroup's previously announced news for layoffs, saying that Citigroup is really hoping to flatten out the organization, remove some of those complexities, and that she expects to announce sometime in the fourth quarter an actual headcount reduction, as well as the cost savings that are expected from those actions.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Mattel How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Mattel is:12% = US$227m ÷ US$2.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.12 in profit.Does Mattel Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Mattel has a lower ROE than the average (15%) in the Leisure industry classification.roeUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for Mattel by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining Mattel's Debt And Its 12% Return On EquityMattel does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.19. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report.

One such stock that merits attention is SLB (NYSE:SLB). The stock, which is currently priced at 58.98, recorded a loss of 3.22% in a day and a 3-month increase of 23.21%. The stock's fair valuation is $121.74, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with SLB. Click here to check it out. SLB 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SLBThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:1. Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.2. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.3. Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is SLB (SLB) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapAn In-Depth Analysis of SLBDespite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with SLB should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score and Beneish M-score. Furthermore, the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years, which raises a crucial question: Is SLB a hidden gem or a value trap? These indicators suggest that SLB, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesSLB: A Closer Look at the CompanySLB, formerly known as Schlumberger, is the largest oilfield service firm in the world, with expertise in myriad disciplines, including reservoir performance, well construction, production enhancement, and more recently, digital solutions. It maintains a reputation as one of the industry's leading innovators, which has earned it dominant share in numerous end markets. Despite its significant market presence, the company's financials reveal a different story.Is SLB (SLB) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapDeclining Revenues: A Red FlagOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of SLB, both the revenue per share (evident from the last five years' TTM data: 2019: 23.55; 2020: 21.34; 2021: 15.40; 2022: 17.30; 2023: 21.63; ) and the 5-year revenue growth rate (-5.7%) have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for SLB's products, or escalating competition in its market sector. Either scenario can pose serious risks to the company's future performance, warranting a thorough analysis by investors.Is SLB (SLB) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapSluggish Earnings Growth: Another Red FlagDespite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, SLB's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. A low price relative to intrinsic value can indeed suggest an investment opportunity, but only if the company's fundamentals are sound or improving. In Steelcase's case, the declining revenues, EBITDA, and earnings growth suggest that the company's issues may be more than just cyclical fluctuations. Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity.ConclusionGiven the declining revenues and earnings, SLB appears to be a potential value trap. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, the company's underlying financials paint a different picture. Therefore, investors must exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.

Nevertheless, the industry will get support from rising e-commerce activities, and solid demand for sustainable and eco-friendly packaging options due to increasing environmental concerns. Pricing actions implemented by the industry players will help offset the impacts of the ongoing supply-chain disruptions and elevated costs.Despite the odds, Packaging Corporation of America PKG, AptarGroup ATR, Greif, Inc. GEF and Karat Packaging KRT are set to gain from these trends.About the IndustryThe Zacks Containers - Paper and Packaging industry comprises companies that manufacture paper and plastic packaging products. The packaging solutions provided by the industry help protect and preserve products, extend the shelf life, and cut down on wastage and loss across the wide and lengthy range of distribution channels. The products range from containerboard and corrugated packaging to flexible and rigid plastic packaging. Some companies manufacture dispensing pumps, closures, aerosol valves and applicators for the beauty, personal, home care and healthcare markets. The industry serves a wide array of markets, including food, beverage, food services and other consumer products, such as beauty, personal care and home care. They also cater to the chemical, agribusiness, medical, pharmaceutical, electronics and industrial markets, to name a few.What's Shaping the Future of the Containers - Paper and Packaging IndustryHigh Costs &amp; Supply-Chain Woes Remain Challenging: Industry participants continue encountering supply-chain disruptions and higher raw material costs from factors like general inflationary pressure, limited availability of certain raw materials and global transportation disruptions. Higher labor, transportation and chemical costs aggravated their woes. The shortage of labor impacted production levels and impaired their ability to meet high demand. The companies have been implementing cost-reduction actions for a while, which are likely to sustain margins. Industry players focus on streamlining their operations and realigning with high-growth key markets to bolster their performances. Some companies recently witnessed declines in volumes due to lower consumer spending on goods, given the inflationary scenario. However, this is a temporary setback as volumes will eventually pick up as these pressures subside. Also, supply-chain issues are gradually showing signs of easing.E-commerce Acts as a Key Catalyst: With rising e-commerce activities over the past few years and the pandemic accelerating it further, the importance of packaging has increased manifold as it maintains the integrity and durability of a product. Packaging also helps withstand the complex product delivery process. Per Statista, revenues in the eCommerce market are projected to reach $3.64 trillion in 2023. Revenues are expected to grow, seeing a CAGR of 11.2% to $5.56 trillion by 2027. In 2021, e-commerce accounted for nearly 19% of global retail sales. By 2026, online sales is anticipated to be 25% of the total global retail sales. This, in turn, will fuel the Containers - Paper and Packaging industry. The industry has significant exposure (more than 60%) to consumer-oriented end markets, such as food and beverages and healthcare, keeping the demand for packaging applications fairly stable across economic cycles.Demand for Eco-Friendly Packaging to Aid Industry: The preference for environmentally friendly biodegradable packaging materials is witnessing a steady rise globally, courtesy of customers’ increasing awareness of environmental issues. The industry is constantly striving to meet the same by adopting the latest technology and bringing innovative products. Industry players have begun incorporating recycled content into production methods. By maximizing recycling, the industry can implement environmentally and economically sustainable production methods.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Containers - Paper and Packaging industry is a 10-stock group within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector.

We will also be navigating through the current market trends, major players and the top 20 renewable energy companies in the US based on revenue. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the Top 5 Renewable Energy Companies in USA by Revenue.The US Renewable Energy Industry: An AnalysisIn 2022, The International Trade Administration reported that the renewable energy industry in the United States is the second largest in the world, following China. The country produces more renewable energy than the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany combined. Renewable energy has penetrated across the US becoming a major part of the national energy mix. By mid-2030, renewable energy is expected to be the leading source of electricity generation in the country.The renewable energy market is segmented on the basis of the source used to derive energy. The main sources include solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal, and municipal solid waste. In the United States, renewable electricity is produced mainly from the wind. While hydroelectric sources are also consumed for this purpose, solar, biomass, and geothermal contribute in smaller proportions to the overall electricity production.Clean Energy Trends Shaping the Industrial LandscapeThe United States is undergoing a major transition towards cleaner sources of energy and carbon neutrality. The power generation from renewable energy has witnessed a rise with solar and wind power being the most adopted sources. On March 1, Bloomberg NEF reported that the investment in clean energy in the US in 2022 increased to $141 billion, up 11% year over year. Out of the total power generation in the country, renewable energy accounted for 41%. This shift from conventional sources of energy even continued during high inflation and interest rates associated with the commodities in the renewable energy sector throughout 2022.Story continuesExperts believe that government support, relevant legislation, federal permits, and reforms will be necessary to capitalize on the emerging clean energy market in the country. Considering the long waiting times which lasts for two to six years for most of the energy infrastructure projects to receive all state approvals, this is a major limitation to the energy transition in the country.Major Industry PlayersThe renewable energy market in the United States is quite fragmented. The major players in this market include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and the Southern Company (NYSE:SO)Headquartered in Florida, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is one of the major generators of renewable energy, from the sun and wind. On July 25, the company reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023.  The company reported earnings per share of $0.88, beating EPS estimates by $0.07. The company’s revenue for the second quarter amounted to $7.35 billion, up 41.79% year over year, ahead of revenue consensus by $1.18 billion.Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is a leading electric power and gas holding company in the United States. The company contributes to the trend of adopting sustainable energy sources in the country. The company has recently expanded its solar energy resources in Indiana. On June 22, the company reported that it has partnered with renewable energy developer, Ranger Power, to buy up to 199 megawatts of solar power from the Indiana-based Speedway Solar facility. The company will be buying this energy from the facility under a 20-year power purchase agreement. This project will generate enough energy to power more than 37,000 homes and is expected to be operational by 2025.Another leading player in the US renewable energy market is the Southern Company (NYSE:SO). Being an energy provider, the company is one of the largest owners of renewables in the United States. The company operates a fleet of solar, wind, and biomass facilities across the U.S. On September 27, the company reported that it has acquired the South Cheyenne Solar Facility which is a 200-megawatt solar project in Colorado. This acquisition enabled the company to expand its renewable energy portfolio.Thus, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and the Southern Company (NYSE:SO) continue to transform the state of energy transition in the United States.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Macy's (NYSE:M) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Macy's:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.099 = US$1.2b ÷ (US$16b - US$4.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).Thus, Macy's has an ROCE of 9.9%.  On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 10%. Check out our latest analysis for Macy's roceIn the above chart we have measured Macy's' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEThings have been pretty stable at Macy's, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at Macy's in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger.What We Can Learn From Macy's' ROCEWe can conclude that in regards to Macy's' returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. And in the last five years, the stock has given away 57% so the market doesn't look too hopeful on these trends strengthening any time soon. Therefore based on the analysis done in this article, we don't think Macy's has the makings of a multi-bagger.Story continuesOne more thing to note, we've identified   3 warning signs  with Macy's and understanding these should be part of your investment process.While Macy's isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

M need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 15, 2023 $5.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Macy's shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Macy's is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Retail - Regional Department Stores industry that ranks in the Top 18% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 34 cents per share to 2 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Macy's right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company value investors might notice is General Dynamics (GD). GD is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 15.45. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.59. GD's Forward P/E has been as high as 20.42 and as low as 15.05, with a median of 16.53, all within the past year.Finally, our model also underscores that GD has a P/CF ratio of 14.27. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. GD's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 18.52. Over the past year, GD's P/CF has been as high as 16.70 and as low as 13.17, with a median of 14.63.These are only a few of the key metrics included in General Dynamics's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now.

Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has likely pulled an extra $2.6 billion over that time frame, the equivalent of gaining an extra $30 million a day.Both nations, which are part of OPEC+, have agreed to slash their crude production along with rest of the cartel over the past year, in an attempt to eliminate price ""distortions"" in the oil market, one UAE official said.OPEC+ members initially cut production by 2 million barrels a day last October, causing oil prices to spike. Then, Saudi Arabia and Russia implemented their own voluntary production cuts this summer, with Saudi Arabia slashing production by 1 million barrels a day while Russia slashed production by half a million barrels a day. Those output cuts will be extended through the end of the year, both nations announced earlier this month.The effects of tighter supply have already started to be felt in the energy spot market, with oil prices now hovering near a 10-month-high. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded around $93 a barrel on Friday, while West Texas Intermediate crude traded around $92 a barrel.Analysts have said crude prices could quickly be on track to notch $100 a barrel next year, thanks to underinvestment and chronic undersupply in the industry.Higher oil prices could be a boon for both nations, with the money helping to fund Saudi Arabia's various lavish spending projects as well as Russia's war on Ukraine.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

That price decline came despite a reduction in output, record exports to Mexico and a rise in the amount of gas flowing to U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants even though some plants were reduced for maintenance. Front-month gas futures for November delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 1.6 cents, or 0.5%, to settle at $2.929 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). For the week, the contract was up about 11% after easing less than 1% last week. For the month, the contract was up about 6% after gaining about 5% last month. For the quarter, the contract was up about 5% after soaring about 26% last quarter. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Financial firm LSEG said average gas output in the lower 48 U.S. states has slid to 102.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in September, down from a record 102.3 bcfd in August. Meteorologists forecast the weather in the lower 48 states would remain mostly warmer than normal through Oct. 14 except for some cooler near-normal days around Oct. 7-11. With the weather expected to remain mostly mild, LSEG forecast U.S. gas demand, including exports, would slide from 95.7 bcfd this week to 94.8 bcfd next week as power generators cut back on the amount of gas they need to burn to keep air conditioners humming. The forecast for next week was lower than LSEG's outlook on Thursday. But with seasonally cooler weather coming and exports expected to rise, LSEG forecast gas demand would climb to 95.8 bcfd in two weeks as heating demand increases. Pipeline exports to Mexico have risen to an average of 7.2 bcfd so far in September, up from a record 7.1 bcfd in August, according to LSEG data. Analysts expect exports to Mexico to rise even higher in coming months once New Fortress Energy's Altamira liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant enters service. Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants have risen to an average of 12.6 bcfd so far in September, up from 12.3 bcfd in August. That compares with a monthly record of 14.0 bcfd in April. That increase in LNG feedgas happened despite ongoing maintenance at Berkshire Hathaway Energy's 0.8-bcfd Cove Point in Maryland and reductions at other plants, including Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass in Louisiana and Corpus Christi in Texas. Cove Point shut for about two weeks of maintenance on Sept. 20. The U.S. is on track to become the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023, ahead of recent leaders Australia and Qatar. Much higher global prices have fed demand for U.S. exports due to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to the war in Ukraine.

We will also be navigating through the current market trends, major players and the top 20 renewable energy companies in the US based on revenue. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the Top 5 Renewable Energy Companies in USA by Revenue.The US Renewable Energy Industry: An AnalysisIn 2022, The International Trade Administration reported that the renewable energy industry in the United States is the second largest in the world, following China. The country produces more renewable energy than the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany combined. Renewable energy has penetrated across the US becoming a major part of the national energy mix. By mid-2030, renewable energy is expected to be the leading source of electricity generation in the country.The renewable energy market is segmented on the basis of the source used to derive energy. The main sources include solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal, and municipal solid waste. In the United States, renewable electricity is produced mainly from the wind. While hydroelectric sources are also consumed for this purpose, solar, biomass, and geothermal contribute in smaller proportions to the overall electricity production.Clean Energy Trends Shaping the Industrial LandscapeThe United States is undergoing a major transition towards cleaner sources of energy and carbon neutrality. The power generation from renewable energy has witnessed a rise with solar and wind power being the most adopted sources. On March 1, Bloomberg NEF reported that the investment in clean energy in the US in 2022 increased to $141 billion, up 11% year over year. Out of the total power generation in the country, renewable energy accounted for 41%. This shift from conventional sources of energy even continued during high inflation and interest rates associated with the commodities in the renewable energy sector throughout 2022.Story continuesExperts believe that government support, relevant legislation, federal permits, and reforms will be necessary to capitalize on the emerging clean energy market in the country. Considering the long waiting times which lasts for two to six years for most of the energy infrastructure projects to receive all state approvals, this is a major limitation to the energy transition in the country.Major Industry PlayersThe renewable energy market in the United States is quite fragmented. The major players in this market include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and the Southern Company (NYSE:SO)Headquartered in Florida, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is one of the major generators of renewable energy, from the sun and wind. On July 25, the company reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023.  The company reported earnings per share of $0.88, beating EPS estimates by $0.07. The company’s revenue for the second quarter amounted to $7.35 billion, up 41.79% year over year, ahead of revenue consensus by $1.18 billion.Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is a leading electric power and gas holding company in the United States. The company contributes to the trend of adopting sustainable energy sources in the country. The company has recently expanded its solar energy resources in Indiana. On June 22, the company reported that it has partnered with renewable energy developer, Ranger Power, to buy up to 199 megawatts of solar power from the Indiana-based Speedway Solar facility. The company will be buying this energy from the facility under a 20-year power purchase agreement. This project will generate enough energy to power more than 37,000 homes and is expected to be operational by 2025.Another leading player in the US renewable energy market is the Southern Company (NYSE:SO). Being an energy provider, the company is one of the largest owners of renewables in the United States. The company operates a fleet of solar, wind, and biomass facilities across the U.S. On September 27, the company reported that it has acquired the South Cheyenne Solar Facility which is a 200-megawatt solar project in Colorado. This acquisition enabled the company to expand its renewable energy portfolio.Thus, NextEra Energy, Inc.

Its shares gained 1% on Sep 28.The SMART/LAB solution equips charging station operators to seamlessly integrate a hybrid payment terminal, which makes use of open-loop technology, within their prevailing charging station infrastructure or to new ones. The specifically built payment gateway in a plug-and-play process makes the integration and setup processes of the payment terminal hassle-free.Subsequently, EV charging station operators can accept common contactless payment and authorization methods while being compliant with the new European Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation requirements. Additionally, they can also accept closed payment systems, comprising the municipal utilities’ charging cards or other electric mobility providers.The fast-charging stations, which can be accessed by the public and operate with a capacity of 50 kW or more, are required to offer a minimum of one contactless payment method (either in the form of debit or credit cards) from Jul 1 of next year.  EV drivers can leverage NFC technology and make safe as well as seamless contactless payments from Mastercard-branded debit or credit cards, which may fetch higher revenues to the tech giant from its payment network.Cashless payments with digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay or with charging and fleet cards of well-known providers will also be accepted at the eligible EV charging stations.The recent partnership is indicative of Mastercard’s sincere efforts to offer increased convenience, flexibility and secured payment options to EV drivers across Europe. Also, it bears testament to the tech giant’s longstanding endeavor to promote the widespread adoption of digital payments. The presence of a worldwide trusted company like MA, whose digital offerings are backed with effective fraud prevention services, may attract a wider customer base in using the newly launched solution.Story continuesAnd SMART/LAB seems to be the apt partner to complement MA’s endeavor as it boasts a leading background system, which will take charge of the authorization and billing of charging processes across Germany.Additionally, the recent tie-up seems to be a well-timed move on the part of Mastercard, considering a booming EV market. Technology advancements, increased environmental awareness and encouraging government policies have led to higher adoption of EVs. According to MarketsandMarkets, the industry is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 13.7% over the 2023-2030 period.

125,66120b96-c117-3874-9584-06f029b66643,MA,2023-09-30,Mastercard: The Human Equation: Using AI and Data To Address Global Challenges and Build Inclusive Economies,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-human-equation-using-ai-154500315.html,1696002300,STORY,['MA'],"[BY CAROLINE MORRISThe Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / September 29, 2023 / How can we use new technology and collective action to significantly improve the lives of all people and the health of our entire planet?That was the central question at the recent second annual Impact Data Summit, hosted by the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth with the Rockefeller Foundation and data.org, for social impact leaders.Coinciding with the United Nations General Assembly meeting and Climate Week NYC, conversations at the summit looked at the current realities of data, artificial intelligence and social impact, their impact on the U.N.'s sustainable development goals, the role of cross-sector collaboration to drive that impact, what the future holds for transformative technology and how to make sure that future is sustainable, equitable and accessible.""As leaders in data, we need to move fast and now, not tomorrow,"" said Shamina Singh, the president and founder of the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth. ""Don't leave here without a new partnership, without a new plan, without a new program … AI, I hope you will think, means actionable impact.""Here are the key takeaways that will define the future of data and AI.01 AI can help the world meet its sustainability goals, with humans' helpData and AI have the potential to help achieve the 17 sustainable development goals laid out by the U.N. in 2015 to jump-start improvements including climate action, gender equality and inclusive economic growth. ""Digital technologies can actually help accelerate 70% of the SDG targets, which is quite incredible,"" said Doreen Bogdan-Martin, secretary-general of International Telecommunication Union, the U.N. specialized agency for information and communication technologies. ""Only 15% of the targets are on track.""Her faith is grounded in the game-changing nature of AI. AI can interpret vast amounts of data that no human could ever process. And it can distill that data into something immediately actionable - a necessity as we race against the clock to solve these human crises.Story continuesAt the same time, human beings must constantly scrutinize AI to understand what it's saying and how it can help generate outcomes that help society and leave no one behind. The wrong outputs and outcomes, said JoAnn Stonier, the Mastercard Fellow specializing in responsible AI and data, ""will only get amplified very quickly in this environment."" But, she added, ""as long as we have the accuracy, we have the right data, and we're doing all of our homework, I do think we're going to start seeing some amazing solutions.""02 Innovating with guardrailsThe internet was not based on a single piece of technology. Instead, its enduring power emerged when Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf - known as the ""fathers of the Internet"" - invented the protocols and architecture that allowed computers to form networks with one another. ""As long as the internet adhered to the basic architecture, it could continue to evolve,"" Kahn said. That approach allowed the internet to persist and expand far beyond its first small network of computers.For AI to make an impact, it will need a similar set of protocols and architecture to create interoperability on an international level.Regulation will have a role to play, too. AI should be serving the communities in which it exists, and these needs vary widely depending on location, so regulation cannot be one-size-fits-all; it requires context to be effective. ""Technology is extremely difficult to regulate for a number of reasons. It evolves very quickly. What you don't want is a static piece of regulation that is built based solely on the way the technology works today,"" said Dorothy Chou, head of policy and public engagement at Google DeepMind. ""Historically, what we've seen is that good regulation actually creates public trust.""03 Together, we go farWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Kenya's government wanted to make informed decisions for the health and safety of its citizens, explained Shikoh Gitau, founder and CEO of Qhala, a Nairobi-based consultancy that specializes in health informatics and the technology of social impact. But every health center had its own small and private data silo. So policymakers were forced to follow frameworks created on other continents, which ultimately proved poorly suited to the needs of Kenya.Information that's fragmented by unnecessary barriers or delayed by bureaucracy loses its ability to make an impact. The way to change these limitations is through collaboration between the public and private sectors. As Holly Krambeck, director of development data partnership for the World Bank, said, ""As much as I hate to admit it, international corporations can't solve everything, so we need global partners of all different types.""04 Drawing in and opening upAs of now, 85% of all AI developers are men, according to Gabriela Ramos, assistant director-general for the social and human sciences at UNESCO. And, as several panelists noted, the majority of data fed into AI comes from North America. That means AI models are being trained with data about a world from a tiny sliver of the global population. In fact, there is almost no data representing the Global South at all - and if there is, it's outdated and in incompatible formats.These gaps in data and AI - as well as a lack of diversity among the data scientists - ultimately hurt everyone. For example, failing to represent women and people of color can produce inaccurate AI outcomes. Those oversights result in leaving millions of investment dollars on the table - money that could help drive resilience, economic growth and the physical wellbeing of entire communities. ""You get out of data what you put into it,"" Ramos said.However, getting the most out of data and AI requires unraveling deep-seated, systemic issues. ""We have to be mindful about not reproducing inequalities from the analog world into the digital,"" said Lamia Kamal-Chaoui, the director of the OECD Centre for Entrepreneurship, SMEs, Regions and Cities. This means investing in data collection in underrepresented areas, improving accessibility to such data, drawing diverse voices into the development of AI and listening to the local communities where new technology will be placed to best serve their unique needs.When it comes to developing digital technology, one of the most significant measurements is how it contributes to the improvement of human life. There may be a divide between better data and better decisions that will make a real difference in people's lives, said Gina Lucarelli, team leader of the U.N. Development Programme's Accelerator Labs. ""The real gems are the moments where you bridge that gap and you actually see data that drives decision-making.""Originally published by The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthCheck out more content from The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthTrooper Sanders, center, chief executive officer of Benefits Data Trust, shares his thoughts on democratizing and harnessing the potential of AI for social impact with Rebecca Finlay, the CEO for Partnership on AI, right, and Danil Mikhailov, executive director of data.org.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on the role of Foreign Direct Investment in Colombia's development and retirement to the country, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Colombia.Role of FDI in Colombia’s DevelopmentIt is often asserted that Foreign Direct Investment plays a relevant role in the economic development of a country. It enables countries to enhance their infrastructure, improve citizens' quality of life, and expand the range of available amenities. Many developing countries are benefiting from such investments, one of which is Colombia. According to the Central Bank of Colombia, FDI to the country grew 81.7% YoY in 2022, to $17.05 billion.“Foreign investment will be a determining factor in favor of Colombia's reindustrialization, as well as in the development of projects such as fair energy transition, sustainable tourism, and agri-food security because it is a driving force in the creation of new jobs, technology transfer and contributes to a better quality of life in the country's regions.""Carmen Caballero, president of ProColombiaThese foreign direct investments are majorly directed towards Cali and similar municipalities in the Valle del Cauca. However, FDI isn't the only factor that is contributing to Colombia's development. Amidst the ongoing global restructuring of supply chains, Colombia is also seen as a potential destination for nearshore operations. Many factors contribute to its importance, such as it's strategic location that connects it with other countries, competitive costs, bilingual human talent, and business and institutional networks.Juan Verde, member of the US Presidential Advisory Council on Foreign Trade and Competitiveness, highlights how almost 70% of Colombia companies are already working on their sustainability plans, an important requisite to be in line with the international market and adapt to global trends.Story continuesVerde further notes that the main sectors in which Colombia has the potential to stand as a leader are mining with rare earth and critical minerals; the health sector, as the US was begging for vaccines, masks, and sanitary materials in the pandemic; and also food security. One such organization that already has its operations for South America centered in Colombia is Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX).Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) is a global med-tech leader and an American multinational healthcare company with headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois. The organization is playing a role in Colombia's economy and improving the quality of life for its people. An example of such an improvement is the unique partnership between UNICEF and Baxter International Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX). Together, they have been improving water security in the ancestral lands of the indigenous Wayúu people in northern Colombia, deprived of quality water resources.Moreover, another American company leveraging human talent and the innovative technological landscape of Cali in Colombia is TaskUs, Inc. (NASDAQ:TASK). TaskUs, Inc. (NASDAQ:TASK) provides outsourced digital services, such as digital CX solutions, Artificial Intelligence operations, and Content Security. Recently, the Business Process Outsourcing Provider has announced the expansion of its operations in Colombia with a new site in Medellín. Its office in Cali has been enjoying significant growth since its inception in June 2022, TaskUs, Inc. (NASDAQ:TASK) reports.“The cultural richness and dynamic spirit of Medellín, along with the warm and welcoming nature of its people, make it the perfect location for our expansion,” said Pablo Gonzalez, incoming vice president of operations in Medellín, in a statement.“We are excited to collaborate with the local community, embrace its unique culture, and contribute to the city’s economic growth.”Retiring to ColombiaHailed as one of the easiest countries to gain citizenship as an American and one of the most popular overseas retirement destinations for expats, Colombia can be a retiree’s dream. From the scenic Andes mountains to pristine beaches and lush rainforests, the country offers a diverse geography for retirees to relish and enjoy the outdoors. Retiring in Colombia has many pros and cons, and potential retirees must go through them before deciding to retire to the country.Pros of retiring to the country include the affordable cost of living, friendly locals, affordable and world-class healthcare, as well as delicious cuisine. An individual retiree can live in the country comfortably between $900 to $2,000, depending on their needs and lifestyle choices. The food scene is incredibly diverse, with each region having its fair share of traditional dishes. Moreover, healthcare in the country is comprehensive and quite affordable, an important requisite for retirees.But there are some reasons not to live in Colombia as well. These include the terrible traffic in cities and expensive education. Moreover, mosquito-borne viral diseases, amongst others, are widespread in the country. In conclusion, Colombia's stunning natural landscapes, affordable cost of living, rich culture, and friendly local communities make it a popular retirement destination. So, when asking, ""Is Colombia a good place to live?"" for retirees, the answer is a resounding yes.12 Best Places to Retire in ColombiaPixabay/Public DomainMethodologyIn order to compile the list of best places to retire in Colombia, we have used a number of sources such as International Living, Nomadic Fire, Adam Fayed, amongst others.

We will also be navigating through the current market trends, major players and the top 20 renewable energy companies in the US based on revenue. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the Top 5 Renewable Energy Companies in USA by Revenue.The US Renewable Energy Industry: An AnalysisIn 2022, The International Trade Administration reported that the renewable energy industry in the United States is the second largest in the world, following China. The country produces more renewable energy than the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany combined. Renewable energy has penetrated across the US becoming a major part of the national energy mix. By mid-2030, renewable energy is expected to be the leading source of electricity generation in the country.The renewable energy market is segmented on the basis of the source used to derive energy. The main sources include solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal, and municipal solid waste. In the United States, renewable electricity is produced mainly from the wind. While hydroelectric sources are also consumed for this purpose, solar, biomass, and geothermal contribute in smaller proportions to the overall electricity production.Clean Energy Trends Shaping the Industrial LandscapeThe United States is undergoing a major transition towards cleaner sources of energy and carbon neutrality. The power generation from renewable energy has witnessed a rise with solar and wind power being the most adopted sources. On March 1, Bloomberg NEF reported that the investment in clean energy in the US in 2022 increased to $141 billion, up 11% year over year. Out of the total power generation in the country, renewable energy accounted for 41%. This shift from conventional sources of energy even continued during high inflation and interest rates associated with the commodities in the renewable energy sector throughout 2022.Story continuesExperts believe that government support, relevant legislation, federal permits, and reforms will be necessary to capitalize on the emerging clean energy market in the country. Considering the long waiting times which lasts for two to six years for most of the energy infrastructure projects to receive all state approvals, this is a major limitation to the energy transition in the country.Major Industry PlayersThe renewable energy market in the United States is quite fragmented. The major players in this market include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and the Southern Company (NYSE:SO)Headquartered in Florida, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is one of the major generators of renewable energy, from the sun and wind. On July 25, the company reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023.  The company reported earnings per share of $0.88, beating EPS estimates by $0.07. The company’s revenue for the second quarter amounted to $7.35 billion, up 41.79% year over year, ahead of revenue consensus by $1.18 billion.Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is a leading electric power and gas holding company in the United States. The company contributes to the trend of adopting sustainable energy sources in the country. The company has recently expanded its solar energy resources in Indiana. On June 22, the company reported that it has partnered with renewable energy developer, Ranger Power, to buy up to 199 megawatts of solar power from the Indiana-based Speedway Solar facility. The company will be buying this energy from the facility under a 20-year power purchase agreement. This project will generate enough energy to power more than 37,000 homes and is expected to be operational by 2025.Another leading player in the US renewable energy market is the Southern Company (NYSE:SO). Being an energy provider, the company is one of the largest owners of renewables in the United States. The company operates a fleet of solar, wind, and biomass facilities across the U.S. On September 27, the company reported that it has acquired the South Cheyenne Solar Facility which is a 200-megawatt solar project in Colorado. This acquisition enabled the company to expand its renewable energy portfolio.Thus, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and the Southern Company (NYSE:SO) continue to transform the state of energy transition in the United States.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Medtronic The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.16bUS$6.08bUS$6.22bUS$7.31bUS$7.54bUS$7.74bUS$7.93bUS$8.12bUS$8.31bUS$8.50bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 2.63%Est @ 2.49%Est @ 2.38%Est @ 2.31%Est @ 2.27% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$5.7kUS$5.2kUS$4.9kUS$5.4kUS$5.1kUS$4.9kUS$4.6kUS$4.4kUS$4.1kUS$3.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$48bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.5b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.2%) = US$147bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$147b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$67bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$116b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$78.4, the company appears about fair value at a 9.8% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Medtronic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.002. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MedtronicStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Medical Equipment market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Medtronic, there are three further items you should further research:Risks: Take risks, for example - Medtronic has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does MDT's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Medtronic would retain a stake in the new company of more than 35%, the sources added.The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Medtronic and Carlyle declined to comment.New York-listed Medtronic, which has a market value of $105 billion, makes medical devices that treat more than 70 health conditions across its cardiovascular, diabetes, medical surgical and neuroscience divisions.The Dublin, Ireland-based company raised its annual profit forecast last month, as the return of non-urgent surgery volumes to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels boosted demand for its medical devices.Earlier this year, Medtronic competitor Baxter International Inc also embarked on a pruning of its assets to focus on growth. It said in January it would spin off its renal care and acute therapies units and in May it agreed to sell its biopharma solutions business to a private equity consortium comprising Warburg Pincus and Advent International for $4.25 billion, including debt.Carlyle, one of the world's biggest private equity firms with $385 billion in assets under management, is a prolific investor in the healthcare sector.Its previous deals include primary care clinic operator One Medical, which it took public and then sold to Amazon.com Inc for $3.9 billion last year, and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, a medical screening business it acquired from Johnson &amp; Johnson in 2014 for $4 billion before selling it to COVID-19 test maker Quidel Corp in a $6 billion cash-and-stock deal that was completed last year.(Reporting by David Carnevali in New York; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)]"

If you want to skip our discussion on the robotics industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy Now.According to Precedence Research, the size of the robotics industry stood at $72.2 billion at the end of 2022. The industry is predicted to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.7% from 2022 to 2032 to reach a size of $283.2 billion. Based on the product type of robots, traditional industrial robots dominate the market with a 52% market share in 2022. Meanwhile, collaborative robots or cobots are the fastest-growing product segment as they are designed to help people perform their tasks with a better level of precision and sophistication. In terms of components, the hardware segment accounts for 72% of the market share. The remaining 28% of the market share is captured by software and services segments. When it comes to specific industry applications, manufacturing takes the lead, accounting for a substantial 68% of the market's top-line share. In terms of geography, the Asia Pacific region generates the most revenue, with a share of 46% in 2022. Within the Asia Pacific region, China leads as it has a track record of being responsible for 50% of all global installations taking place in the region over the years.Robotics Industry's Growth ProspectsAccording to the International Federation of Robotics, unit sales of industrial robots compounded at an average annual rate of 7% from 2017 to 2022. Meanwhile, annual unit sales of robots increased by 5% YoY to reach 553,032 in 2022. Overall, in the manufacturing industry, the global density of robots stood at 151 robots per 10,000 employees, and the stock of industrial robots stood at 3.91 million. The IFR anticipates a 7% annual average growth rate in the next three years, which would result in annual installations of 718,000 units by 2026. One of the reasons for the strong demand for industrial robots is significant investments in car manufacturing facilities and the overall modernization of industrial facilities across various sectors. You can also check out the Top 10 Industrial Robotics Companies in the World here, which play pivotal roles in this dynamic industry.Story continuesAccording to Mordor Intelligence, there is a strong demand for industrial robots in the healthcare sector as well. As per the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the most hazardous jobs in the US are performed by employees in the healthcare sector, exposing workers to the highest rates of on-the-job illnesses and non-fatal injuries. According to estimates, there are already 6,000 robots worldwide that are performing one million surgeries annually. Another sector that is a strong end-market for the robotics industry is the building maintenance industry. As per the US Bureau of Labor, there are 2.38 million janitors and cleaners employed across the US, and companies spend around $60 billion annually on these services. This amount does not include the insurance payouts, which are substantial as well due to the risky nature of the job. The heightened risk factor is one of the primary reasons for a stronger demand for cleaning robots. Cleaning robots have already made significant headways in the consumer segment. Around 19 million robots that performed domestic tasks were sold during 2022, marking an impressive year-over-year (YoY) increase of 12% in the largest consumer robot category.The healthy growth outlook of the robotics industry can also be attributed to the global aging population, as the need for robots is expected to rise due to their increased requirement in assistance living and domestic healthcare services. According to the United Nations (UN), every sixth person in the world will be above the age of 65 by the middle of this century as opposed to one in 11 people currently. Meanwhile, in Europe, one in every fourth person could be older than 65 by 2050. The number of population above the age of 80 is anticipated to triple from 143 million in 2019 to 426 million in 2050. The Japanese government is already embracing the impact of an aging population and a shortage of skilled staff as it has announced funding to make up for a gap of 380,000 skilled employees by 2025.Investment Opportunities in Robotics and AutomationIn addition to investing in the best robotics stocks, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), investors can also gain broad exposure to themes of robotics and automation by investing in the 10 Best Robotics ETFs such as iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (NYSEARCA:IRBO). The ETF launched in June 2018 has net assets of $488.2 million and a total of 113 holdings. The ETF has a management fee of 0.47% and generated a return of 23.8% in the last year. It also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index, which yielded a return of 18.7% during the same period. Furthermore, UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) is also amongst the cheap robotics stocks attracting investor attention currently. The New York-based software company founded in 2005 can be regarded as one of the best automation stocks as it provides a platform for robotic process automation (RPA).13 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy NowA robotic arm in the process of assembling a complex circuit board - showing the industrial scale the company operates at.

One such stock that merits attention is Illumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN). The stock, which is currently priced at $136.72, recorded a gain of 3.3% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 26.47%. The stock's fair valuation is $338.39, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ILMN. Click here to check it out. ILMN 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ILMNThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:1. Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.2. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.3. Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Illumina (ILMN) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapIdentifying the RisksHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Illumina should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score and Altman Z-score. These indicators suggest that Illumina, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Company SnapshotIllumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a leading provider of tools and services for analyzing genetic material with life science and clinical lab applications. The company generates over 90% of its revenue from sequencing instruments, consumables, and services. Illumina's high-throughput technology enables whole genome sequencing in humans and other large organisms. Its lower throughput tools enable applications that require smaller data outputs, such as viral and cancer tumor screening. Illumina also sells microarrays that enable lower-cost, focused genetic screening with primarily consumer and agricultural applications.Story continuesThe company's current market cap is $21.60 billion, with sales amounting to $4.50 billion. However, Illumina's operating margin and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) stand at 0, while its Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 11.38. These figures indicate a challenging financial scenario for the company.Is Illumina (ILMN) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapConclusion: Navigating the Value TrapWhile Illumina's stock price appears to be undervalued based on its GF Value, the company's financial indicators suggest potential risks. The low Piotroski F-score and Altman Z-score, coupled with the company's zero operating margin and ROIC, indicate that Illumina may be a potential value trap. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

We will also be navigating through the current market trends, major players and the top 20 renewable energy companies in the US based on revenue. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the Top 5 Renewable Energy Companies in USA by Revenue.The US Renewable Energy Industry: An AnalysisIn 2022, The International Trade Administration reported that the renewable energy industry in the United States is the second largest in the world, following China. The country produces more renewable energy than the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany combined. Renewable energy has penetrated across the US becoming a major part of the national energy mix. By mid-2030, renewable energy is expected to be the leading source of electricity generation in the country.The renewable energy market is segmented on the basis of the source used to derive energy. The main sources include solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal, and municipal solid waste. In the United States, renewable electricity is produced mainly from the wind. While hydroelectric sources are also consumed for this purpose, solar, biomass, and geothermal contribute in smaller proportions to the overall electricity production.Clean Energy Trends Shaping the Industrial LandscapeThe United States is undergoing a major transition towards cleaner sources of energy and carbon neutrality. The power generation from renewable energy has witnessed a rise with solar and wind power being the most adopted sources. On March 1, Bloomberg NEF reported that the investment in clean energy in the US in 2022 increased to $141 billion, up 11% year over year. Out of the total power generation in the country, renewable energy accounted for 41%. This shift from conventional sources of energy even continued during high inflation and interest rates associated with the commodities in the renewable energy sector throughout 2022.Story continuesExperts believe that government support, relevant legislation, federal permits, and reforms will be necessary to capitalize on the emerging clean energy market in the country. Considering the long waiting times which lasts for two to six years for most of the energy infrastructure projects to receive all state approvals, this is a major limitation to the energy transition in the country.Major Industry PlayersThe renewable energy market in the United States is quite fragmented. The major players in this market include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and the Southern Company (NYSE:SO)Headquartered in Florida, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is one of the major generators of renewable energy, from the sun and wind. On July 25, the company reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023.  The company reported earnings per share of $0.88, beating EPS estimates by $0.07. The company’s revenue for the second quarter amounted to $7.35 billion, up 41.79% year over year, ahead of revenue consensus by $1.18 billion.Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is a leading electric power and gas holding company in the United States. The company contributes to the trend of adopting sustainable energy sources in the country. The company has recently expanded its solar energy resources in Indiana. On June 22, the company reported that it has partnered with renewable energy developer, Ranger Power, to buy up to 199 megawatts of solar power from the Indiana-based Speedway Solar facility. The company will be buying this energy from the facility under a 20-year power purchase agreement. This project will generate enough energy to power more than 37,000 homes and is expected to be operational by 2025.Another leading player in the US renewable energy market is the Southern Company (NYSE:SO). Being an energy provider, the company is one of the largest owners of renewables in the United States. The company operates a fleet of solar, wind, and biomass facilities across the U.S. On September 27, the company reported that it has acquired the South Cheyenne Solar Facility which is a 200-megawatt solar project in Colorado. This acquisition enabled the company to expand its renewable energy portfolio.Thus, NextEra Energy, Inc.

Wonder Group has reached a deal with Blue Apron (APRN) to acquire the meal kit company for $103 million. Lastly, Bank of America analysts upgrade Anheuser-Busch's (BUD) stock to a ""Buy"" rating.Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton highlight several of the day's trending stocks after Friday's closing bell.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJOSH LIPTON: Now, let's check in on a few of today's top trending tickers. Nike shares closing the week on a strong note on the back of its first quarter earnings report. The retail giant Nike signaled easing concerns regarding a slowdown in China and saw inventories dip 10% compared to a year ago in its first quarter.So we talked about this when, Julie, it was beaten down heading into this print. Investors--JULIE HYMAN: It was.JOSH LIPTON: --were sellers. There were even some analysts on the Street heading into the print, they downgraded their rating, right? Because they were worried about the consumer. They were worried about the China. Now, maybe in parts a sigh of relief here today.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, most definitely. But a couple of things that are fascinating to me about this. One is the ripple effect that we are--JOSH LIPTON: Yup.JULIE HYMAN: --seeing not just in other shoe makers today, right? Everything from Puma to Adidas to On Holdings, we were seeing a boost there, but also many of the retailers who sell through Nike shoes from a Foot Locker. Even I think Kohl's was getting a bump today. Under Armor also got a bit of a halo effect.And the reason for that seems to be specifically what Nike said about inventories, where it saw some improvement in its inventory levels. Nike had embarked on a bit of a strategy to cut prices in order to clear out its inventory glut. And that seems to have worked. So then the thinking is, well, if it can do it, then others can. And maybe then they'll see some stability in prices and not as much cutting in the prices perhaps. So that seems to be some of the chatter that I'm seeing around this broader ecosystem, if you will--Story continuesJOSH LIPTON: You know, to your point--JULIE HYMAN: --and one of the reasons--JOSH LIPTON: --I mean, you look at the athletic gear sector today-- Foot Locker, Under Armor, Skechers.JULIE HYMAN: I forgot Dick's. That was the one I forgot.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, absolutely all in the green.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, so big increases there. Here's a fun one that we've been watching today. Blue Apron shares-- haven't talked about that in a while-- higher after it was announced that Wonder Group would be buying the online meal kit company. Blue Apron stockholders will be entitled to receive $13 in cash per share of class A common stock through a tender offer.So the shares up 134%. Overall, it's about a $100 million deal. Now, Wonder is an interesting company. This is Marc Lore's food truck company that then pivoted into sort of a ghost kitchen company, right?JOSH LIPTON: Yup.JULIE HYMAN: But Blue Apron has been beat down for years. It's a very crowded field now. And then--JOSH LIPTON: Went public at $2 billion, yep.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.JOSH LIPTON: And then competition Amazon, Kroger--JULIE HYMAN: Exactly.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: But lots of different meal kit. I mean, like, every time you listen to a podcast, you can't get past a-- past it without hearing some meal kit promo and ads. And so it's a very crowded field. But I mean, like, look at the highs of where we saw this stock.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, but-- and now, Marc Lore weighing in here. He's saying, this is going to bring him one step closer to achieving his goal, Julie, of creating a super app for mealtime.JULIE HYMAN: Super app for--JOSH LIPTON: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: --meal time. We'll see if that works. I actually used Wonder when it was still the food truck company. So basically, what it would do is they would drive the truck to your house and cook the food--JOSH LIPTON: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: --like sitting outside of your house and bring it to you.JOSH LIPTON: And listen--JULIE HYMAN: It was all right.JOSH LIPTON: --when Marc speaks, a lot of people listen. Incredible track--JULIE HYMAN: It's true.JOSH LIPTON: --record. He's the one, of course, sold jet.com to Walmart for around $3 billion. So when he speaks, people tend to perk up.JULIE HYMAN: It's true.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. Shares of Anheuser-Busch rising today after Bank of America upgraded its recommendation for the stock from a hold to a buy, citing margins appearing to have reached inflection point as cost of goods, sold pressures have started to ease. Of course, this one, Julie, we know got caught up in a culture war issue that--JULIE HYMAN: Yes.JOSH LIPTON: --did affect the brand and the business. But this analyst sees better times. And they're talking about margins but also talking about how they think this is a brand that's better positioned, especially in markets like Latin America.JULIE HYMAN: I mean, basically, at what point does the negative get priced into the stock?JOSH LIPTON: Right.JULIE HYMAN: And so this analyst is effectively saying it's been priced in.JOSH LIPTON: Yup.JULIE HYMAN: And so after the beating that the stock has seen this year on the heels of that Bud Light promotion that went wrong for the company on a number of different levels, now, you know, it's time for people to take another look is what this--JOSH LIPTON: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: --analyst is saying.JOSH LIPTON: And even with the pop here, though, still down nearly 10% on the year.]"

The main benchmarks lost steam as the session wore on, however, as brinkmanship in Washington D.C. has the U.S. government all but likely to shut down over the weekend.Ahead of the opening bell, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said its August personal consumption and expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation that tracks consumer spending, was up 0.4% month-over-month and 3.5% year-over-year – both figures higher than what was seen in July.Still, the monthly increase (0.1%) and annual increase (3.9%) in core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, were each lower than July's figures. Additionally, the year-over-year core PCE reading was the lowest in two years.""The inflation news was rather positive,"" says Edward Moya, senior market strategist at currency data provider OANDA. "" When you combine today's PCE and consumer data with yesterday's downward revised personal consumption numbers, one should expect that economic activity will slow down quicker in the fourth quarter.""The data boosted expectations the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates steady at both its November and December meetings, even as the central bank at its most recent gathering projected one more potential rate hike this year.According to CME Group, futures traders are pricing in an 86% chance for a pause at the next Fed meeting, up from 73% one week ago. The probability the central bank will keep the federal funds rate unchanged at its current range of 5.25% to 5.5% in December rose to 64% from last week's reading of 58%.Shutdown looms as short-term spending measure failsLowered expectations for future rate hikes sent Treasury yields retreating and stocks soaring out of the gate, though sentiment fizzled into the weekend as investors worried over a looming government shutdown. The deadline to pass funding legislation is Saturday at midnight. This afternoon, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy failed to find support to pass even a stopgap spending measure.Story continuesShutdowns historically have not been all that bearish on stocks. However, one complication could be that a data dependent Fed will find itself flying blind. Economic data will not be tabulated during a shutdown, says Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office. This ""ironically could cause them to err on the side of holding steady, instead of increasing rates, until they get clearer data sets,"" Schleif adds.Nike shines after earningsAfter being up more than 1% this morning, the Nasdaq Composite finished up 0.1% at 13,219. The S&amp;P 500 ended 0.3% lower at 4,288. The Dow Jones Industrial Average underperformed its peers, shedding 0.5% to 33,507, though two of its components – Nike (NKE) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) – were among the day's best stocks.Nike, for its part, jumped 6.7% after the athletic apparel maker reported higher-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings of 94 cents per share. The company also said inventory levels were down 10%. Revenue of $12.9 billion fell short of analysts' estimates. The big earnings beat sent fellow shoe stocks Adidas (ADDYY, +6.1%) and ON Holding (ONON, +6.1%) soaring.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), meanwhile, was the best Dow Jones stock today. Shares of the pharmacy chain popped 6.4% after a Bloomberg report indicated the company is considering Tim Wentworth, a former Cigna (CI) executive, as its next CEO. Earlier this month, Rosalind Brewer announced she was stepping down as head of Walgreens.All three main benchmarks finished the month and quarter with substantial losses.Related contentRecession Odds Decline, but a Slowdown is Still NearKiplinger's Weekly Earnings Calendar for This WeekVanguard ETFs vs Mutual Funds: Which Make for Better Investments?]"

The cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage are great ways to understand the financial strength of a company. Pfizer's cash-to-debt ratio is 0.69, which is lower than 54.59% of 1057 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry.

Its operating margin is 30.09%, which ranks better than 95.05% of 1051 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks Pfizer's profitability at 9 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is a crucial factor in the valuation of a company. A faster-growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Pfizer is 34.4%, which ranks better than 90.37% of 924 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 29.6%, which ranks better than 76.21% of 887 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is another way to determine its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Pfizer's ROIC is 13.17, and its WACC is 7.2.Unveiling Pfizer (PFE)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) shows every sign of being significantly undervalued.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis on the changing status of Greece and moving to the country, go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Greece. The Changing Status of GreeceAccording to CNBC, the interest of foreigners in the Hellenic Republic’s Residency by Investment scheme almost doubled in 2022, with a total of 2,767 requests registered by the Greece Ministry of Asylum and Migration. Requests registered, as of 2021, were around 1,521. 63% of the total number of requests since the effectiveness of this scheme has been from Chinese citizens. Moreover, wealthy internationals from the United States have also been increasingly interested in the Golden Visas of Greece.The last two years have also seen the country putting in a comprehensive legislative framework of tax incentives. The purpose of this framework has been to attract new tax residents and investments to the country. The framework encompasses four distinct laws, each catering to specific demographics: non-domiciled tax residents, foreign retirees, digital nomads, and family investment offices of high-net-worth individuals. Ever since, the government has received more than 1,000 applications from retirees and foreign professionals from 21 countries to declare their tax residency in the country.This program also aims to complement Greece's visa program, namely the Golden Visa program, and has been successful in doing so. To date, the program has attracted more than 9,000 individual investors from abroad.“As shown by the data for the first period of implementation of the new provisions, despite the adverse circumstances of the pandemic, the impact of the new tax incentives is extremely encouraging,” said Finance Minister Christos Staikouras. The minister added further that “Greece, moving forward with planning, vision and confidence, is recovering strongly from the health crisis, developing and is open to attracting investments and human capital.”Story continuesReal estate prices and costs of living in the country are some of the lowest in the European Union, another plus for those looking for the cheapest places to live or retire in Europe. The country has been doing quite well economically, and businesses and investors are increasingly interested in the country. 2022 saw the country's debt-to-GDP ratio decreasing by 20%, reflecting growth, fiscal adjustment, and high inflation. Greece is also emerging as a dynamic source of solutions for countries such as the US, extending its influence beyond energy diplomacy and defense to encompass high-tech innovation, healthcare, and green energy.Foreign Investments in GreeceBetween 2021-2022, the US was the 8th largest source of foreign investment in the country. Prominent examples of investments made in the country include AWS, Cisco, Deloitte, Digital Realty, Google, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Meta, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). Together, these investments aim to make an impact worth billions of dollars over the next few years.“We have seen many American companies, from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Meta, making large investments in Greece,” said US Ambassador to Greece, George Tsunis. ""Right now, even more American companies are coming to invest in our shared future, in recognition of talents present in Greece and the great potential,"" he added, referring to investments in the fields of technology, 5G optic fibers, energy, tourism, and shipping.In particular, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has unveiled its ambitious €1 billion investment blueprint for Greece. The plan aims to open three data center buildings, new well-paying high-tech jobs, and train over 40,000 workers across both the public and private sectors. Meanwhile, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has also been expanding its global footprint by opening their operations center in the country. Pfizer Inc.

Patients are gradually understanding the benefits of obesity drugs like Novo Nordisk’s NVO Wegovy. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly’s LLY Mounjaro (tirzepatide) — already approved for diabetes — could be the second drug for treating obesity, if it is approved for the indication by the FDA this year.The obesity drugs are designed in such a way that they suppress appetite so you eat less and eventually lose weight.According to the World Health Organization, over one billion people worldwide are obese. Obese people have a body mass index (BMI) above 30 while a BMI between 25 and 30 is considered overweight. Obesity has become a global health problem as it can cause other diseases like heart disease, diabetes and stroke. This resulted in an exponential increase in demand for these obesity medicines. Also, social media has somewhat hyped the benefits of these medications.According to a Morgan Stanley report, the market for obesity drugs could reach $77 billion by 2030. Though supply issues may affect sales growth of these drugs in the near term, with the obesity market gaining popularity, analysts are expecting sales to increase. Pharma companies are rushing to enter the marketHere, we discuss three large drugmakers expected to gain the largest share of this fiercely growing market.Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk’s popular GLP-1 receptor agonist, Wegovy (semaglutide – 2.5 mg), is an anti-obesity injection. Wegovy is seeing strong prescription trends and is generating impressive revenues and profits for Novo Nordisk. In clinical studies, patients taking Wegovy have experienced an average loss of 15% of their body weight over a 68-week period. Wegovy sales were up 363% at a constant exchange rate (“CER”) in the first half of 2023.In August, Novo Nordisk reported positive data from the phase III SELECT study, which evaluated Wegovy (semaglutide 2.4 mg) as an adjunctive treatment for preventing cardiovascular (“CV”) diseases in adults with overweight or obesity. Data from the study showed that Wegovy reduced the risk of major adverse CV events by 20%. Obesity is one of the major risk factors responsible for CV diseases. A weight-loss drug like Wegovy, which also has CV benefits, is expected to see increase in sales and demand.Story continuesIn addition, the CV benefit could probably make Wegovy eligible for insurance coverage. Currently, obesity drugs like Wegovy are considered lifestyle drugs and not eligible for coverage under Medicare health plans.Novo Nordisk is also evaluating a once-daily oral formulation of semaglutide for obesity indication in late-stage studies, with a potential FDA filing expected later this year. Novo Nordisk is also developing PYY 1875 for weight management in phase II studies.In August, Novo Nordisk also announced plans to acquire Canada’s private company Inversago Pharma, which makes CB1 receptor blocker therapies for obesity, diabetes and other serious metabolic diseases. CB1 is a cannabinoid receptor that plays an important role in appetite regulation and other cardiometabolic pathways. Inversago Pharma’s lead pipeline candidate, INV-202, an oral CB1 inverse agonist, demonstrated weight loss potential in an early-stage study.Eli LillyLilly reported strong data from obesity studies of its new drug Mounjaro (tirzepatide), a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist. Mounjaro is already approved for type II diabetes and is generating impressive sales. Mounjaro sales totaled $1.55 billion in the first half of 2023.Mounjaro showed a superior weight-loss reduction in clinical studies for the obesity indication. Regulatory applications have already been filed for Mounjaro for the obesity indication in the United States and EU. In the United States, the FDA has assigned priority review to the regulatory filing, with a decision expected by year-end.In addition, Lilly’s pipeline also includes retatrutide (GGG tri-agonist) and orforglipron, which are being developed, in late-stage studies, for type II diabetes and obesity.In August, Lilly acquired private biotech Versanis, which is expected to strengthen its position in the obesity market. Versanis’ lead pipeline candidate is bimagrumab, a monoclonal antibody being developed in a phase IIb study alone and in combination with semaglutide in adults who are overweight or obese. Bimagrumab has the potential to show better quality weight loss by reducing fat mass while preserving muscle mass in people who are obese or have obesity-related complications.PfizerPfizer PFE also has candidates for obesity in its pipeline even though it is behind competition. Pfizer is currently evaluating its oral, small molecule GLP-1-RA candidate danuglipron in a phase II study in patients with obesity and type II diabetes. Data from the phase II study is expected by the end of the year. If this study is successful, it will enable Pfizer to finalize the phase III plan.Among some other companies, Amgen AMGN also has maridebart cafraglutide in its pipeline that is being studied in a phase II study for treating obesity.While Pfizer and Eli Lilly sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Novo Nordisk has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For more companies, head on over to Top 5 Cloud Computing Companies in USA.Cloud computing is one of the hottest buzzwords in the tech market today. But where did this word come from? Some accounts believe that the word dates back to 2006, when the big tech companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Google at that time, began using “cloud computing” to define a new segment of computer software services and file management across the Web. According to the MIT Technology Review, the term “cloud computing” was first used in 1996 at the offices of Compaq Computer, when tech executives were designing the future of the internet, calling it “cloud computing.” Nevertheless, the world got to know more about this technology when companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) began to push cloud computing efforts. One of the first articles covered on cloud computing was on November 15, 2007, when The New York Times reported the headline “I.B.M. to Push ‘Cloud Computing,’ Using Data From Afar.” The article addressed the beginning of internet-based supercomputing. Market OutlookCloud computing is one of the largest segments in IT and it continues to grow considering the increasing demand for cloud products and services across industries, institutions, companies, and governments.

The refinery is working with solar energy developer Sol Systems to install panels on 30-acres of MPC-owned land that's adjacent to the refinery.""During periods of peak sunlight, the panels will deliver five megawatts of electricity,"" Robinson Engineering Supervisor Corie Biggs said. ""Over the course of a year, this could avoid consumption of as much as 11,200 megawatt-hours of electricity from the electric grid, which is equal to the annual energy use of roughly 1,000 homes.""Construction is expected to start in early 2024, and commercial operation is anticipated by the end of next year. As project developer, Sol Systems will coordinate the construction and operation of the solar farm, which will provide power to the refinery at a fixed rate for 20 years. After this period, Robinson will have the option of taking over ownership of the system.This project builds upon sustainability initiatives in recent years that have earned the refinery recognition for its energy efficiency through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ENERGY STAR® program. At the 2022 ENERGY STAR Industrial Partner Meeting, a Robinson steam turbine optimization project was named one of the 12 Top Projects in the U.S. industrial sector. Also last year, Robinson earned its fifth consecutive ENERGY STAR certification with site efficiency in the top 25% of industry peers.Story continues""These achievements reflect the hard work of our teams in continually scrutinizing our refining processes to find ways of further reducing energy use,"" said Robinson Refinery General Manager Amy Macak.

Analysts there see improved profit growth as the impact of the Bud Light boycott fallout, input cost pressures, and its investments in Latin America are already baked into the stock price.""Anheuser-Busch InBev's margins are at an inflection point, in our view, as cost of goods sold (COGS) pressures have started to ease, [the greater than] $1 billion profit hit from Bud Light is in the base and a higher cost of doing business, which has weighed on margins in recent years, is now largely in the base too, we believe,"" Bank of America analyst Andrea Pistacchi wrote in a note to clients.AB InBev stock has looked to recover amid a rocky year for the company. Year to date, AB InBev stock is down 7.7%, while shares of its competitors Molson Coors (TAP) and Constellation Brands (STZ) are up 23% and 8%, respectively.A turning point for declining Bud Light marginsMargins have been declining at the beer giant since 2018, but BofA expects a 300-basis-point increase in the next three years.""From a top-down perspective, in the current environment, ABI offers relatively good earnings visibility, with its Latin America exposure (which should be fairly resilient) and earnings per share growth supported by pricing power, cost of goods deflation and deleveraging,"" Pistacchi wrote. However, the analysts don't see margins returning to 2019 levels.Bud Light parent company AB InBev has seen margins decline for the past three years. (BofA)In its most recent quarterly results, the company posted a slight beat on earnings per share, coming in at $0.72, compared to $0.71 expected. In the third quarter, earnings per share are expected to come in at $0.89, per Bloomberg estimates. AB InBev will report earnings on Oct. 31.Volume declines have yet to recover for AB InBev, though, as the crucial NFL football season unfolds. Story continuesThis football season, beer brands are entering ""uncharted waters"" given Bud Light's struggles this year, Bump Williams of Bump Williams Consulting told Yahoo Finance over the phone.Sales of Bud Light declined sharply in May after a marketing campaign with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked a widespread boycott in April, causing it to lose the top spot to Modelo in May.Now, six months later, Bud Light sales are still down 28.1%, compared to a year ago, according to Bump Williams Consulting data, while competitors such as Coors Light (TAP) continue to get a boost, up 19.6%.Other brands in AB InBev's portfolio have taken a hit too. Sales of Budweiser are down 11.5% while sales of Michelob Ultra, Stella Artois, and Busch Light, among other brands, are down by single-digit percentages.""Bud Light is likely to spend an enormous amount of money to try to rebuild its brand after the shocking declines earlier this year,"" Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University, told Yahoo Finance previously. ""The competitors are going to work very hard to make it difficult for Bud Light to do that.""Former New York Jets player Nick Mangold drinks a Bud Light beer as he is inducted into the Jets Ring of Honor at MetLife Stadium on Sept. 25, 2022, in East Rutherford, N.J.

Our cause is just. Striking for a better future to protect our communities and to defeat corporate greed is not just our right. It's our duty.- Joining us now, Willett Advisors Chairman and CEO and former head of the Obama Auto Task Force, Steve Rattner. Steve, it's great to see you again. Obviously, we just heard some fierce rhetoric there from Shawn Fain, which we have come to know him for in this time that he has been at the head of this union and really leading this strike. It seems like on some points, the union has softened its demands to some extent. For example, reportedly now looking for 30% increase instead of a 40% increase. What do you think here? Do we get some kind of agreement given what you've been seeing between the two sides? IStory continuesSTEVE RATTNER: Think eventually, we'll get an agreement simply because eventually, every strike of consequence like this one does get settled. I would concede that this one looks tougher than many others for two reasons. First, because it's being played out in public, which makes it more difficult for either side, both sides, to back off of demands as the negotiations progress toward some common sense.And secondly, because the UAW, as I've said, has many, many legitimate requests, demands, whatever you want to call them, but they've also asked for some things that are just simply not possible for the companies to comply with, and we'll have to see how they walk back from that.- And Steve, when you mention that, impossible to comply with, what are you specifically referring to?STEVE RATTNER: Well, for example they want to be paid for 40 hours a week but work 32 with one day a week being a personal day off. That obviously is very hard. They want to go back to the old system of defined benefit pension plans, which I certainly think is a better place for workers to be, but it's something that pretty much as a country, we gave up 20 or 30 years ago, and there have been very few new defined benefit pension plans created.They want to improve retiree health care benefits, which again, I'm sympathetic to, but they have pretty generous ones relative to most other retired American workers. And you simply can't turn back the clock to where we were 20 or 30 years ago and maintain a viable Detroit set of companies.- Well, and on that point, Steve, how should Americans understand the auto business right now? In other words, the union says, look at these executives making a lot of money. Look at the record profits that these companies are making. How tough is it for the automakers right now? Because on their side, they would say, well, our margins are slim. We can't just be throwing around money willy nilly. Where's the truth of the matter lie?STEVE RATTNER: As with most of these things, somewhere in between. So look, to take them in order, executive compensation, as I've said over and over again, is out of control across corporate America. The fact that the CEO of General Motors has gone from making 60 times the average worker in the late 1970s to 360 times the average worker today is unconscionable.But then you say to yourself, do you solve this problem by bringing the top down or the bottom up? I certainly would like to bring the bottom up, but the total dollars involved become very large relative to the dollars you save by bringing the top down. And I'm in favor of bringing the top down, but it's not going to create a pool of money that's going to meaningfully change things for the American workers.On your second point, yes, they are making record profits. They also are facing pretty tough competitive situation. And I would again point out that if you bought a share of General Motors when the company went public, you would have received some dividends along the way, but the stock price itself has not changed at all, even though the stock market as a whole is almost four times higher than it was back on that day.So this is a tough business. I have been around this business. It is a tough, globally competitive, relatively low margin business in which costs do matter. And that's why these companies are fighting so hard. I'm very sympathetic to the workers. They have not gotten the kind of increases they need to keep up with inflation. But manufacturing is a very different space than driving a UPS truck or flying an American Airlines plane.- And Steve, the issue has become very politicized. I don't think that surprises anybody. But the engagement of Biden and Trump, is that helping or hurting, Steve, the ability to actually get a deal done here?STEVE RATTNER: Hurting. I don't think there's any real precedent or argument for leaders or presidents to get in the middle of these kinds of negotiations. If it involves something like the railroads where there are national economic implications, I can understand that the federal government has a role. But in this case, I think it just simply inflames the situation.I think that the President should not have gone on the picket lines, but he was egged on by Trump, going to the other factory in Michigan the other night. And I get why he did it, but none of this is helping reach a resolution in my opinion.- Sort of strike aside for a moment, as you said, you've been around the auto business. Is there a way for US automakers to better compete, whether that is some kind of operational change they should be making, or it's some sort of regulatory or policy change that should be happening?STEVE RATTNER: Look, I think the auto companies are in a much better place than they were 15 years ago obviously. They are making good profits. They have dramatically improved their management. This was an industry that did not have good management at all, especially General Motors when we showed up 15 years ago. A lot of those problems have been fixed. A lot of those problems have been fixed.But they are still in a tough, competitive world. And the issue is that you have to think of labor in the auto industry as a worldwide commodity, if you will, that you can source labor from the Midwest where these companies traditionally have done most of their manufacturing. You can source it from the south where there are ununionized plants, both Japanese and other countries, that where the workers get paid 1/2 or 2/3 of what they get paid around the Midwest area. You can source it in Mexico where workers get paid as little as $9 a day and by all accounts are very, very productive.And that's the problem these companies face. And it's not it's not a pretty picture. And I don't take any joy in it. I take a lot of unhappiness about the situation, but this is the world we're living in, and we have no choice but to try to be competitive, which means holding down costs, unfortunately, including those of labor.- And Steve, final question. I'm interested, just to pull back the lens here. Of course, we see big labor on the move here. It's not just the UAW. Hollywood actors and writers, UPS workers, airline pilots. The pendulum seems to be swinging here a bit, Steve, back to labor. I'm interested to get your take on that. Why you think that is. What explains that dynamic, and what you think it means for companies across different sectors and industries in terms of their labor expenses and their profit margins going forward.STEVE RATTNER: Look, I think that's probably a good thing. I think that the power of labor has been circumscribed for 40 years, going back to Ronald Reagan and the air traffic controllers. And that has had consequences for all American workers who have not seen their share of the pie go up commensurately with the share that's gone to corporate profits.And so if you look at the economy broadly, that is definitely developed now over several decades, as I said, that is not welcome. It's come back up today because we have a 3.8% unemployment rate. There's still 1 and 1/2 open jobs for every American looking for one. And so the supply and demand of labor, just to get back to economics 101 stuff, has swung in favor of the workers, and they're now starting to use that ability. And I'm all in favor of it.But you have to make a distinction between service industries, you mentioned the screenwriters, for example, and a manufacturing worker. Whether the screenwriters get paid more or less, or the LA hotel workers are on strike at the moment, I believe, get paid more or less, doesn't really change the competitive situation. Those workers have to be sourced locally. If they get paid more, it comes to some degree out of corporate profits. To some degree, probably prices go up a bit. But that's all fine that is simply redressing the imbalances that have occurred.When you get to manufacturing, which for better or worse, is now a relatively small 10%, 15% of our economy, that's where you get back to this global competition phenomenon that I just described. Where if you pay those workers more, it's going to simply eventually mean-- if you pay them much more, they should get paid more. But if you pay them a huge amount more, it's going to simply result in jobs moving.When we took over, we got involved with the auto companies in 2009, the number of auto workers in Mexico had just about reached the number of auto workers in the US. Today, there are substantially more auto workers in Mexico than in the US. And that's not an accident. It's not a coincidence. And there's not much you can do about it except to try to find a reasonable balance between having these workers get paid a living wage, a fair wage, but also the companies being able to compete against companies elsewhere in the world that have lower labor costs.- Steve Rattner, thank you so much for your time today. It was great insight. We appreciate it.STEVE RATTNER: Thank you, guys.]"

They made last-minute progress with Stellantis. You can note here that they are not expanding their strike against Stellantis.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Basically this is a big deal because GM again hit by these stand-up strikes, this time hitting GM's Lansing Delta Township plant, which makes the Buick Enclave and Chevrolet Traverse. And in the plant hit affected by Ford is Ford's Chicago assembly plant, which makes the Lincoln Aviator and Ford Explorer. So some popular SUVs there that will be sort of shut down here. We've seen estimates that every week that goes on, $100 to $200 million in profit is getting evaporated for the Big Three, based on where they're striking. And of course, it expands and gets worse and worse and worse.DAN IVES: If you looked up in the dictionary ""debacle,"" there'd be the UAW strike. That's who you'd see right now.

But right now, no, this is more about wages and that sort of growth.GREGORY MIGLIORE: I think it's going to take a few weeks for the strike to really have an impact on production and, perhaps, prices and sales, primarily because the strike has been targeted.

And they're far apart on that issue, it seems like still. But there are other issues as well.I mean, we think about pensions and wage tiers, a lot of moving pieces here, and one reason I think some people think this can actually drag on for a while. What's your take?GREGORY MIGLIORE: I think it could be a while. Every day, every week that goes by that we don't see a deal, it looks like there's going to be an expansion of the targeted strike. We saw that again this week with two more factories. There's one near Lansing which makes the Buick Enclave and the Chevy Traverse, and then another Ford factory that makes the Explorer and the Lincoln Aviator.Those are definitely significant factories to go offline for these two automakers. I was a little bit surprised, frankly, to see that there was a fair amount of progress on the Stellantis front. And Stellantis was not included in this latest round of the strike expansion.Story continuesSo I think the more the time passes, the harder it could be to get a deal. I mean, ultimately, they're going to have to work this out. So it will end at some point. But it seems like they're pretty far apart right now.I mean, specifically, I think the wage issue is something-- they're going to be able to iron that out. At some point, you kind of come together. You look at the numbers, and you make a deal.But there are probably more significant issues, like pensions, like the tier system, like the access for the UAW to unionize some of the battery factories. Those are all critical sticking points. And it doesn't seem like they're making a lot of progress there.JULIE HYMAN: Well, there's the substance of the negotiations. And then there's the rhetoric surrounding the negotiations. And on that point, it feels like the claws are now coming out at this stage.I'm just looking at some reports from an automotive news reporter that says-- that quotes Sean Fain as saying Jim Farley is lying about the state of negotiations and kind of gets some other barbs in there. In your time looking at this strike and other strikes, does-- how much does that factor in? In other words, if they're very publicly being sort of nasty to one another, what does that signal about the negotiations?GREGORY MIGLIORE: I mean, sometimes it means nothing. Sometimes it's all basically made for TV. And then what's going on behind the scenes can be very productive. I think perhaps in the past we've seen some of that.The most recent strike that lasted for over a month in 2019 that impacted General Motors, there was definitely some rhetoric, some animosity that went around. But by and large, they did eventually get a deal done in fairly reasonable order.This time around, I think Sean Fain, the UAW president, has done a very good job of controlling the narrative. He's been very active on social media, on Facebook, on YouTube. And those are all modern media tactics that we haven't really seen from the union in recent years.So he's been very-- using that in a savvy manner. Today, I think you saw Jim Farley, who had a press conference at 1 o'clock Eastern time, I think he kind of hit back. He is an executive who's known for basically saying what he thinks. And I think his sort of frustration showed through today.He definitely tried to make his case and take it directly to the media, to the people on their own live stream today. So it definitely seems like not only are the sides farther apart, in the case of Ford, it does seem like things are definitely heating up in perhaps a negative way.]"

Stellantis was spared this time though, with UAW President Shawn Fain saying the carmaker has made in his words, significant progress on key issues. Three weeks into the strike, the economic impact is starting to ripple beyond the big 3 and the auto space.Let's bring in Wedbush managing director and senior equity analyst, Dan Ives, with a breakdown here. Dan I'm looking at the stock moves of the big 3, and not a whole lot of movement on the back of the latest announcement here. How big of a hit is this, or does this intensify in any way compared to where we've been the last two weeks?DAN IVES: Well, look, I mean, this is-- if you looked up in the dictionary debacle, there'd be the UAW strike. That's what you'd see right now. And I think for the street, it's not about the next quarter or two, it's about what this does to the EV strategy. And I think this is just-- it's which poison do you pick, right? Because if they accept this deal, GM, Ford, I mean, I believe this would significantly impair their EV strategy for decades to come. So that's why right now, they're going to continue to fight in this cage match for UAW and fan.Story continues- Let's look at some of the sticking points here. We start with the benefits, specifically looking at what that means from a cost perspective. We got reports yesterday that the UAW has come down from its initial request of pay increase of more than 40%, but we're still looking at roughly 30, maybe in the high 20s where they want it to be. What does that mean from a cost perspective of an EV to the consumer?DAN IVES: Yeah. Because ultimately, the consumer is going to have to pay this. I mean, it's going to get passed down, right? And I think if you look at the current deal, we think $3,000, $4,000 to $5,000 per vehicle. That would be the incremental cost. If you go down to call it mid-20s, that's something that's maybe digestible where we're talking $1,000, $1,500.But look, the big issue here is foreign automakers, and especially Tesla, I think right now Tesla is champagne on ice because this was going to be the lingering competition that's gone after Tesla. And I think the frustration is to watch someone like Mary and the team build this brick by brick for years to get to this point, now the torpedo hits their strategy.- Do they scale back their strategy as a result? I mean, let's take that argument you just made, $1,000 additional. If the carmakers are able to move things in their direction, I mean, we're still talking about cars out there like Ikea, Tesla that already enjoy a cost-- already have a cost benefit because they are selling at a cheaper price point. You add in the government incentives into that, does that prompt the big 3 to say, look, maybe we need to scale back our ambitions so at least from a cost perspective, we can still compete in the market?DAN IVES: I disagree. I mean, to that point, I know someone raised it, they have to dive into deep end of the pool on EVs. I mean, this is the future. This is-- when you look at how GM's built everything from Ultium and the battery technology, I mean, they've built what I view as potentially a transformative strategy in Detroit. I think Farley, obviously, has gotten for in the right direction as well.They cannot take a step back here. I mean, that's why right now, this is going to be a heavyweight boxing match because they understand that is going to be the strategy. But the UAW, they're going to have to play ball in terms of some negotiation here to get a deal done. Otherwise, this is going to be a long and nasty few months.]"

Ford CEO Jim Farley firing back in a statement saying that it is, quote, ""grossly irresponsible"" to expand the strike. And the union is holding a deal hostage over future EV battery plants.But another company securing a labor contract. United Airlines reaching a deal with its pilots' union. And the contract includes a pay raise that could top 40% over four years. It's the last of the big three airlines to reach a deal with its pilots amid an industry shortage. The pilots' union says the deal is worth $10 billion.And the city of New York coming to a near standstill. we can tell you this from experience. As a result of continuing rain and major flooding, roads and subways facing closures and delays throughout the day, 23 million people across New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut are under a flood watch. One of LaGuardia airport's main terminals has been closed for most of the day. And hundreds of flights have been delayed or canceled.]"

If you want to skip our discussion on the robotics industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy Now.According to Precedence Research, the size of the robotics industry stood at $72.2 billion at the end of 2022. The industry is predicted to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.7% from 2022 to 2032 to reach a size of $283.2 billion. Based on the product type of robots, traditional industrial robots dominate the market with a 52% market share in 2022. Meanwhile, collaborative robots or cobots are the fastest-growing product segment as they are designed to help people perform their tasks with a better level of precision and sophistication. In terms of components, the hardware segment accounts for 72% of the market share. The remaining 28% of the market share is captured by software and services segments. When it comes to specific industry applications, manufacturing takes the lead, accounting for a substantial 68% of the market's top-line share. In terms of geography, the Asia Pacific region generates the most revenue, with a share of 46% in 2022. Within the Asia Pacific region, China leads as it has a track record of being responsible for 50% of all global installations taking place in the region over the years.Robotics Industry's Growth ProspectsAccording to the International Federation of Robotics, unit sales of industrial robots compounded at an average annual rate of 7% from 2017 to 2022. Meanwhile, annual unit sales of robots increased by 5% YoY to reach 553,032 in 2022. Overall, in the manufacturing industry, the global density of robots stood at 151 robots per 10,000 employees, and the stock of industrial robots stood at 3.91 million. The IFR anticipates a 7% annual average growth rate in the next three years, which would result in annual installations of 718,000 units by 2026. One of the reasons for the strong demand for industrial robots is significant investments in car manufacturing facilities and the overall modernization of industrial facilities across various sectors. You can also check out the Top 10 Industrial Robotics Companies in the World here, which play pivotal roles in this dynamic industry.Story continuesAccording to Mordor Intelligence, there is a strong demand for industrial robots in the healthcare sector as well. As per the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the most hazardous jobs in the US are performed by employees in the healthcare sector, exposing workers to the highest rates of on-the-job illnesses and non-fatal injuries. According to estimates, there are already 6,000 robots worldwide that are performing one million surgeries annually. Another sector that is a strong end-market for the robotics industry is the building maintenance industry. As per the US Bureau of Labor, there are 2.38 million janitors and cleaners employed across the US, and companies spend around $60 billion annually on these services. This amount does not include the insurance payouts, which are substantial as well due to the risky nature of the job. The heightened risk factor is one of the primary reasons for a stronger demand for cleaning robots. Cleaning robots have already made significant headways in the consumer segment. Around 19 million robots that performed domestic tasks were sold during 2022, marking an impressive year-over-year (YoY) increase of 12% in the largest consumer robot category.The healthy growth outlook of the robotics industry can also be attributed to the global aging population, as the need for robots is expected to rise due to their increased requirement in assistance living and domestic healthcare services. According to the United Nations (UN), every sixth person in the world will be above the age of 65 by the middle of this century as opposed to one in 11 people currently. Meanwhile, in Europe, one in every fourth person could be older than 65 by 2050. The number of population above the age of 80 is anticipated to triple from 143 million in 2019 to 426 million in 2050. The Japanese government is already embracing the impact of an aging population and a shortage of skilled staff as it has announced funding to make up for a gap of 380,000 skilled employees by 2025.Investment Opportunities in Robotics and AutomationIn addition to investing in the best robotics stocks, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

(ISRG): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-intuitive-surgical-130007212.html,1695992407.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -5.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Intuitive Surgical, Inc. falls in, has lost 6.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.57 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +19%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.45 indicates a change of +15.9% from what Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $1.77 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.7%. The $7.13 billion and $8.16 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14.7% and +14.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIntuitive Surgical, Inc. reported revenues of $1.76 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.4%. EPS of $1.42 for the same period compares with $1.14 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.35%. The EPS surprise was +7.58%.Over the last four quarters, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Ross Stores basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Ross Stores, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Ross StoresFor the fiscal year ending January 2024, this discount retailer is expected to earn $5.23 per share, which is a change of 19.4% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Ross Stores. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 6.1%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Ross Stores to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Throughout September, Regions Online Banking is proud to help support the fight against prostate cancer.NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / September 29, 2023 / Regions BankBy Doug SegrestDr. Jeffrey Nix first met Mike Slive the conventional way, as physician and patient.Now Nix is ensuring that Slive's vision remains intact as a member of the Mike Slive Foundation board of directors.""There are very few men who wielded the power and influence Mike had and still remain the same person,"" Nix said. ""Sometimes, there's a tradeoff, but there never was with Mike. He could come in and, with his presence, command a room. But he always remained approachable, and he was easy to become friends with.""Slive, the longtime SEC Commissioner and one of the most powerful forces in college athletics during his tenure, passed away in 2018 from complications due to his lengthy battle with prostate cancer.Five years later, his mission to fund research for prostate cancer and educate men on how best to fight the disease continues on with a new generation. And, once again, Regions Bank is helping play a role.Throughout September, Regions is supporting The Mike Slive Foundation's fight against prostate cancer - and helping save lives by funding innovative research. Through Sept. 30, $1 will be donated to the Mike Slive Foundation for every new qualifying consumer Regions Online or Mobile Banking, Bill Pay, Zelle® and External Transfer transaction.You can find more details on regions.com.Nix, the Joe Chamblis endowed professor for prostate cancer reasarch and innovation, and the Director of Robotic Surgery at UAB, said the Mike Slive Foundation is unique because of its founder.""The Foundation has been pretty remarkable,"" Nix said. ""Most cancer startups, in terms of research funding, take years before they become well-enough established to start the process of grant funding. Yet the Slive Foundation started grant funding within the first year, which is amazing.""Story continuesIn addition, Slive's connection throughout the sports world ensured another facet of his vision - education - would be a factor from the start.Events like Block Cancer feature 30 college basketball games in 28 cities, providing free cancer screenings and opportunities to learn about combatting the disease. For the past two years at the Regions Tradition, a major event on the PGA TOUR Champions schedule, fans of Hall of Fame golfers also had the chance to get free screenings. In a matter of minutes.Cure rates are really high when detected early. You want to get screening and detection early so we have options.Jeffrey Nix, member of the Mike Slive Foundation board of directorsThe field of prostate cancer research has seen numerous breakthroughs over the last few years. Certainly, research funded by the Mike Slive Foundation and others has played a significant role.But the best prevention remains the standard: early screening.""Cure rates are really high when detected early,"" Nix said. ""You want to get screening and detection early so we have options. But at the same time we need more research for prostate cancer at advanced stages so we don't have to continue to lose family members like Mike..""The Mike Slive Foundation also fills a void in an area of the country that has some of the highest incidences of prostate cancer, but also lacks access to screening and treatment.""When we started, we knew there was a regional void in the Southeast in terms of research,"" Nix said. ""And there are higher instances of prostate cancer here. But just a few hours from where we are in Birmingham (Alabama), access to healthcare is dramatically different.""By making screening and treatment more accessible, and by funding research to find a cure, the Mike Slive Foundation is following its founder vision.""Mike knew this was a big space, with room for improvement,"" Nix said. ""And, each day, we are seeing improvement and better results.""But many of the hangups remain entrenched.Most cancer startups, in terms of research funding, take years before they become well-enough established to start the process of grant funding. Yet the Slive Foundation started grant funding within the first year, which is amazing.Jeffrey Nix""When you get a cancer diagnosis, it's hard to get men to talk about it or to feel good about it. Our relationship between sports and men's health is an obvious way to reach men.""We've seen a myriad of breakthroughs, but the reality is that research takes money. That remains a major focus.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this global payments processor have returned -5.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Visa falls in, has lost 3.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Visa is expected to post earnings of $2.23 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0%.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.65 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +15.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.77 indicates a change of +13% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Visa is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $8.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9.8%. The $32.59 billion and $35.88 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.2% and +10.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $8.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.7%. EPS of $2.16 for the same period compares with $1.98 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.72%. The EPS surprise was +2.37%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers.

It estimated Brazil's 2024/25 (April-March) sugarcane crop at 629 million tons, and sugar production at 41.1 million tons. (Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; editing by Grant McCool)]"

The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$514 and falling to the lows of US$445. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether KLA's current trading price of US$458 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at KLA’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for KLA What Is KLA Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 7.11% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy KLA today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $427.69, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because KLA’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will KLA generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. KLA's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? KLAC’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on KLAC, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into KLA, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Having said that, from a first glance at Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Verizon Communications:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.093 = US$31b ÷ (US$380b - US$51b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, Verizon Communications has an ROCE of 9.3%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return, but it's much better than the Telecom industry average of 6.4%. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications roceIn the above chart we have measured Verizon Communications' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For Verizon Communications Tell Us?In terms of Verizon Communications' historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 13% over the last five years. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Verizon Communications' ROCETo conclude, we've found that Verizon Communications is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Since the stock has declined 25% over the last five years, investors may not be too optimistic on this trend improving either. On the whole, we aren't too inspired by the underlying trends and we think there may be better chances of finding a multi-bagger elsewhere.If you want to continue researching Verizon Communications, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.While Verizon Communications may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

To skip our detailed analysis of the nature and scope of the generative AI industry in 2023, go directly and see 10 Greatest Classical Music Composers of All Time.According to the McKinsey Global Survey, 2023 has been nothing short of a breakout year for generative AI. Less than one year since generative AI stocks like NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have had their moment in the sun, one-third of McKinsey's survey respondents admit using generative AI tools like Bard and ChatGPT in at least one business function. To read about more companies which are currently dominating the generative AI market in 2023, check out our coverage of the 18 Biggest Generative AI Companies In The World. Amid recent strides, AI has risen from a topic delegated to tech employees to one of the primary concerns of top business leaders in the world;  25% of surveyed C-suite executives admit to personal use of generative AI in daily business operations. Furthermore, more than 30% of respondents from companies have said that generative AI is of utmost priority on their boards' agendas. More interestingly, 50 percent of survey respondents have claimed that their companies are likely to substantially increase investment in AI overall due to the resounding success of generative AI tools in modern business practices. According to McKinsey, organizations which have already integrated company operations with AI capabilities have generally been the first to explore the potential of generative AI, and companies which are already basking in the profits generated by traditional AI are already outpacing competitors in their adoption of gen AI tools. Although the expected business disruption due to the rampant adoption of generative AI is more than substantial, respondents are also anticipating workforce cuts in certain areas and undergoing massive reskilling efforts to address changing organizational dynamics. Story continuesCan AI Imitate the Greatest Classical Music Composers of All Time?Despite the fact that generative AI is postulated to become a $1.3 trillion industry by 2032 at an astonishing CAGR of 42% according to Bloomberg, the complete nature and scope of its utility is still something that experts have not exactly figured out. However, in light of the recent SAG-AFTRA strikes, employees in the music industry are contemplating the future of their employment with respect to the advent of generative AI capabilities. They constantly find themselves wondering whether gen AI can imitate the best screenplay writers or musical composers. It would be pertinent to note that the concept of using generative AI to imitate the greatest classical music composers of all time is hardly a new phenomenon, as the history of algorithmic composition can be traced back to about 500B.C. In that time period, ancient Greek philosopher and music theorist Pythagoras expounded the intricate relationship between mathematics and music. From the 11th to the 14th centuries, music theorists like Guido d'Arezzi and Franco of Cologne established strict regulations for music notations, including but not limited to the time values of single notes, pitches, and rhythms. According to an article by NBC, due to this intricate interconnection between music and mathematics, the rules that govern the pitch and harmonic progression in classical music are fundamentally programmable and interpretable to generative AI as well. Algorithmic analyses imitate the process of human-composed classical music, which is then developed into motifs of more sophisticated melodies and themes, articulating a coherent and comprehensive form of classical music.According to an article by The New York Times, R.A.V.E. is an excellent example of machine learning, a classification of AI technology which composers have experimented with since the early 90s. But in the face of rapid development, the arrival of publicly available, AI powered music tools and the dominating influence of high-profile initiatives by large tech companies like NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), R.A.V.E. is now able to reconstruct its input, compress audio signals it receives, and extract the salient features of the sound to resynthesize it in its entirety. R.A.V.E. has since been used in concerts around the world. According to The Washington Post, the technology has gone far beyond the mere reconstruction of classical music. Generative AI is swiftly becoming part of popular culture. In 2019, TikTok's parent company ByteDance acquired AI music platform Jukedeck, that created tools to let users significantly resynthesize music to match videos. In 2020, Shutterstock Inc. (NYSE:SSTK) purchased assets of Amper, which auto-generated music based on specific criteria like mood, length, tempo and instrumentation. However, according to an article by The Washington Post, although AI music is now slowly finding its way into the mainstream, the tailwinds associated with generative AI in music are not likely to be long lasting. According to composer Tod Machover:""This technology is generating infinite music that isn’t actually composed by anybody, and that’s a terrible, scary, awful way of thinking about where music could go. I mean, really, it’s the worst kind of elevator music.""For Machover, the human touch is infinitely integral to music. He postulates that AI represents a way to exponentially enhance access to music and creative tools for making it and that it cannot imitate the works of some of the greatest classical music composers of all time. Machover's work has largely focused on the creation of what he terms ""hyperinstruments"" which tend to use sensors, signal processors, and software to enhance the musical power of performers, all the while building interactive musical instruments for nonprofessional musicians. He argues that generative AI tools for music today merely use machine learning to sift through archives of data to discern patterns and textures. However, its grasp over the complexities and emotiveness of music is still arbitrary. Like other generative AI tools by companies like NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), these systems can imitate music in limited ways as they do not know much about music in general.How are Music Companies Navigating Generative AI?In February 2023, an AI song entitled ""Heart on My Sleeve"" which imitated the voices of certain popular music celebrities went viral on Spotify Technology's (NYSE:SPOT) music platform. Soon after taking it down, the company's CEO explained in a BBC interview that the legitimate use of generative AI included tools which improved music, much similar to auto-tune. However, music companies like Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have clarified that the use of generative AI systems to impersonate and imitate the greatest classical music composers of all time and other artists will not be permitted on the platform. In keeping with this announcement, in April 2023, Spotify and Apple Music removed dozens of songs which used generative AI capabilities to clone the vocals of different artists. To know more about how leading music streaming platforms are navigating through different technological advancements, check out our article on the 15 Most Popular Music Streaming Services.Amid strong opposition from certain artists like Hozier, music streaming companies like Spotify Technology S.A.(NYSE:SPOT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have admitted to taking a nuanced approach. They have announced that there will be no blanket ban on music generated by artificial intelligence if the use of AI in music is deemed to be valid. However despite this announcement, Spotify Technology S.A.(NYSE:SPOT) has since decided to pilot a feature which will leverage the company's generative AI capabilities to translate podcasts into different languages while retaining the voice of the speaker. As music companies Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) deliberate over the incorporation of generative AI in their operations, it presents huge potential for companies investing in gen AI like NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META).Our MethodologyTo compile our list of the 50 greatest classical music composers of all time, we decided to undertake a consensus based approach by acquiring data from a variety of different credible sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). We picked composers that appeared at least twice in these sources, assigning them a cumulative score based on the numbers at which they appeared on the lists. For example, if a composer was ranked at number 5 on one list and number 6 on another, we gave them a total score of 11. Some of the criteria we considered for inclusion in the list were originality, influence, craftsmanship, and enjoyability. We then ranked all the entries based on their cumulative scores, from highest to lowest. Where there was a tie, we broke it based on the frequency at which a composer appeared in our research.To watch for companies which are diverting great investments in generative AI in order to capitalize on the industry's major upside potential, check out our coverage of the Top 10 Generative AI Companies to Invest In.50 Greatest Classical Music Composers of All Time50.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends Nvidia (NVDA) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 31.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 219.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -27.1%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Nvidia has an S/TA ratio of 0.74, which means that the company gets $0.74 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.72, it can be said that the company is more efficient.In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Nvidia is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 81.8% this year versus the industry average of -6%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2.4% over the past month.Bottom LineNvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Nvidia is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

227,72c9d09c-56e4-35da-9c43-052f4ad01bfa,MCK,2023-09-30,4 Stocks That Stand Out on Attractive Interest Coverage Ratio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-stand-attractive-interest-121800920.html,1695989880,STORY,"['MOD', 'MOH', 'MCK']","[We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter, thus offering a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on. But if you are seeking long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage,” which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Story continuesModine Manufacturing Company MOD, Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. SFM, Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH and McKesson Corporation MCK boast an impressive interest coverage ratio.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening:Modine Manufacturing, a diversified global leader in thermal management technology and solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of A.

228,a52022f9-5a22-3435-9368-c2f5c7fe0568,TRV,2023-09-30,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 83%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/travelers-companies-inc-nyse-trv-132033684.html,1695993633,STORY,['TRV'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Travelers Companies' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 15 shareholders own 51% of the companyUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyA look at the shareholders of The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 83% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Travelers Companies. See our latest analysis for Travelers Companies ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Travelers Companies?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Travelers Companies. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Travelers Companies' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Travelers Companies. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.4% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.8% and 7.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 15 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Travelers CompaniesThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that The Travelers Companies, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$141m worth of shares (at current prices).

236,99a28367-47f4-309e-a297-acbe436267b5,DIS,2023-09-30,Disney Plus announces crackdown on password sharing in Canada,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-plus-announces-crackdown-password-153803808.html,1696001883,STORY,['DIS'],"[NEW YORK (AP) — Password-sharing crackdowns are becoming more and more common in the streaming world today. And Disney Plus is following suit.In an email sent to the users in Canada earlier this week, Disney announced restrictions on Canadian subscribers' “ability to share your account or login credentials outside of your household.”Disney Plus’ updated Canadian Subscriber Agreement says users cannot share a subscription outside their household unless permitted by their account tier — noting that violations could lead to Disney Plus limiting or terminating service. “Household” covers the collection of devices associated with a subscriber’s primary residence and used by the individuals who live there, per the streamer's help center.These password-sharing restrictions are part of multiple updates to Disney Plus' Subscriber Agreement set to go into effect for most Canadian users Nov. 1. Annual subscribers in Quebec could see the changes a bit later, depending on their billing cycle — and users who switch their plan prior to Nov. 1 will see the updates apply immediately, this week's email said.As previously announced in August, Nov. 1 is also the date that Disney Plus will roll out ad-supported tier offerings both in Canada and select European markets. Disney Plus’ ad tier has are already been in the U.S. since December 2022.It's unclear when or if similar household restructions could be seen beyond Canada. When contacted by The Associated Press, a spokesperson for Disney Plus did not share additional details.In an earnings call last month, Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger vowed to make its streaming services profitable — notably through via a planned October price hike on its ad-free Disney+ and Hulu plans in the U.S. and a crackdown on password sharing expected to extend through next year.At the time, Iger didn’t provide details about the password-sharing crackdown beyond saying that Disney could reap some benefits in 2024, although he added that the work “might not be completed” that year and that Disney couldn’t predict how many password sharers would switch to paid subscriptions.New streaming restrictions go well beyond Disney. Netflix, for example, notably made headlines cracking down on password sharing. In the U.S., freeloading viewers are now being required to open their own accounts unless a subscriber with a standard or premium plan agrees to pay an $8 monthly surcharge to allow more people living in different households to watch.]"

Per a recent report by The Verge, the company has already informed its Canadian Disney+ subscribers through email that the restriction will begin from Nov 1.Moreover, a new account sharing section in the Canadian Disney+ subscriber agreement notes that Disney may monitor user accounts and failing to comply with the agreement could lead to account limits or termination.Password sharing has been a headwind for streaming providers including Netflix NFLX, which has introduced paid sharing in more than 100 countries, which represents more than 80% of its revenue base. Paid sharing boosted its subscriber base in the second quarter of 2023.Meanwhile, Disney CEO Bob Iger on the fiscal third-quarter conference call stated that it is exploring ways to address account sharing and the best options for paying subscribers to share their accounts with friends and family.In terms of monetization, early this month, Disney launched an ad-free bundled subscription plan featuring Disney+ and Hulu in the United States. Moreover, it is set to launch ad-supported Disney+ subscription offerings in Canada and select markets across Europe, beginning Nov 1.The Walt Disney Company Price and ConsensusThe Walt Disney Company Price and ConsensusThe Walt Disney Company price-consensus-chart | The Walt Disney Company QuoteAt the end of the fiscal third quarter, Disney had signed up 3.3 million subscribers to the ad-supported Disney+ option. Moreover, since its inception, 40% of new Disney+ subscribers have selected an ad-supported product.Disney is also raising the price for Disney+ ad-free to $13.99 per month, up from $10.99 per month. Hulu ad-free will be available from $17.99 per month, up from $14.99 per month.Disney Prospects Suffer From Stiff CompetitionDisney’s password-sharing crackdown initiative is expected to boost its subscriber base. Disney+ has been benefiting from a strong content portfolio despite stiff competition from the likes of Netflix, Amazon AMZN and Comcast CMCSA.Disney shares have lost 7.8% year to date, underperforming Netflix, Amazon and Comcast, which have returned 27.8%, 28.4% and 50.1%, respectively.However, a revival in the Parks, Experiences and Products segment bodes well for the company despite stiff competition from Comcast.Disney is planning to expand investment in its Parks, Experiences and Products segment, which accounted for 37.3% of total revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2023. Over the next decade, it plans to double its capital expenditure to nearly $60 billion.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company now plans to spend on expanding and enhancing domestic and international parks and cruise line capacity.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this entertainment company have returned -4.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry, which Disney falls in, has lost 5.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Disney is expected to post earnings of $0.76 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +153.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.8%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.72 points to a change of +5.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.18 indicates a change of +39.4% from what Disney is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Disney is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Disney, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $21.33 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $88.98 billion and $93.09 billion estimates indicate +7.6% and +4.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDisney reported revenues of $22.33 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.8%. EPS of $1.03 for the same period compares with $1.09 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.44 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.48%. The EPS surprise was +4.04%.Over the last four quarters, Disney surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Disney is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Disney. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We will also be navigating through the current market trends, major players and the top 20 renewable energy companies in the US based on revenue. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the Top 5 Renewable Energy Companies in USA by Revenue.The US Renewable Energy Industry: An AnalysisIn 2022, The International Trade Administration reported that the renewable energy industry in the United States is the second largest in the world, following China. The country produces more renewable energy than the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany combined. Renewable energy has penetrated across the US becoming a major part of the national energy mix. By mid-2030, renewable energy is expected to be the leading source of electricity generation in the country.The renewable energy market is segmented on the basis of the source used to derive energy. The main sources include solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal, and municipal solid waste. In the United States, renewable electricity is produced mainly from the wind. While hydroelectric sources are also consumed for this purpose, solar, biomass, and geothermal contribute in smaller proportions to the overall electricity production.Clean Energy Trends Shaping the Industrial LandscapeThe United States is undergoing a major transition towards cleaner sources of energy and carbon neutrality. The power generation from renewable energy has witnessed a rise with solar and wind power being the most adopted sources. On March 1, Bloomberg NEF reported that the investment in clean energy in the US in 2022 increased to $141 billion, up 11% year over year. Out of the total power generation in the country, renewable energy accounted for 41%. This shift from conventional sources of energy even continued during high inflation and interest rates associated with the commodities in the renewable energy sector throughout 2022.Story continuesExperts believe that government support, relevant legislation, federal permits, and reforms will be necessary to capitalize on the emerging clean energy market in the country. Considering the long waiting times which lasts for two to six years for most of the energy infrastructure projects to receive all state approvals, this is a major limitation to the energy transition in the country.Major Industry PlayersThe renewable energy market in the United States is quite fragmented. The major players in this market include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and the Southern Company (NYSE:SO)Headquartered in Florida, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is one of the major generators of renewable energy, from the sun and wind. On July 25, the company reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023.  The company reported earnings per share of $0.88, beating EPS estimates by $0.07. The company’s revenue for the second quarter amounted to $7.35 billion, up 41.79% year over year, ahead of revenue consensus by $1.18 billion.Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is a leading electric power and gas holding company in the United States. The company contributes to the trend of adopting sustainable energy sources in the country. The company has recently expanded its solar energy resources in Indiana. On June 22, the company reported that it has partnered with renewable energy developer, Ranger Power, to buy up to 199 megawatts of solar power from the Indiana-based Speedway Solar facility. The company will be buying this energy from the facility under a 20-year power purchase agreement. This project will generate enough energy to power more than 37,000 homes and is expected to be operational by 2025.Another leading player in the US renewable energy market is the Southern Company (NYSE:SO). Being an energy provider, the company is one of the largest owners of renewables in the United States. The company operates a fleet of solar, wind, and biomass facilities across the U.S. On September 27, the company reported that it has acquired the South Cheyenne Solar Facility which is a 200-megawatt solar project in Colorado. This acquisition enabled the company to expand its renewable energy portfolio.Thus, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and the Southern Company (NYSE:SO) continue to transform the state of energy transition in the United States.

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 5.42, the question arises: is the stock fairly valued? This article aims to provide an in-depth analysis of ONEOK's valuation, encouraging readers to delve into the subsequent financial assessment.Introduction to ONEOK Inc (NYSE:OKE)Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with OKE. Click here to check it out. OKE 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of OKEONEOK provides natural gas gathering, processing, storage, and transportation as well as natural gas liquids transportation and fractionation. It owns extensive assets in the midcontinent, Permian, and Rocky Mountain regions. With a current stock price of $63.84 and a GF Value of $62.84, the stock appears to be fairly valued. This valuation is based on a comparison of the stock's price with its intrinsic value, estimated using GuruFocus' proprietary GF Value method.ONEOK (OKE): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Fair Market ValueUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.ONEOK (NYSE:OKE) appears to be fairly valued according to GuruFocus' valuation method. The GF Value estimates the stock's fair value based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the stock's share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. Conversely, if the stock's share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have high future returns.

Therefore, it is crucial to carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy its stock. A good starting point is to look at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. ONEOK has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.01, which is worse than 95.45% of 1034 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. GuruFocus ranks ONEOK's overall financial strength at 5 out of 10, indicating that its financial strength is fair.ONEOK (OKE): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Fair Market ValueONEOK's Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies is less risky, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term. A company with high profit margins is usually a safer investment than those with low profit margins. ONEOK has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $19.20 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $5.42. Its operating margin is 19.22%, which ranks better than 66.16% of 984 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Overall, ONEOK's profitability is ranked 8 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. The faster a company is growing, the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of ONEOK is 26.8%, which ranks better than 80.16% of 862 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. However, the 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 7.9%, which ranks worse than 59.28% of 830 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.ONEOK's ROIC vs WACCAnother way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, ONEOK's ROIC was 12.19, while its WACC came in at 9.51.ONEOK (OKE): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Fair Market ValueConclusionOverall, ONEOK (NYSE:OKE) stock appears to be fairly valued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. However, its growth ranks worse than 59.28% of 830 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.

To skip our detailed analysis of the cybersecurity industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Cybersecurity Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying.Interest and Investments In Cybersecurity On The RiseCybersecurity has become a major concern for governments and corporations alike as the prevalence of cyber attacks and breaches has steadily been rising. Governments are becoming increasingly involved in the cybersecurity discourse because of an overall desire to protect national economies from competitors abroad. With wide ranging allegations of economic espionage by way of cyber attacks being made throughout American history, particularly in relation with China, it is evident that the US government considers the cybersecurity of its top companies of utmost importance. Even apart from governmental concerns, companies themselves feel the need to invest in cybersecurity to ensure the safety of not only precious trade secrets, but also employee and customer identities. As a result of these factors, we have been seeing an overall rise in corporate investments flowing towards the cybersecurity sector.A report published by Moody's on September 28 highlights how cyber budgets in major companies have been steadily growing in light of a higher prevalence of cyber attacks and breaches in recent years. The report mentions that between 2014 and 2020, in particular, the number of cyber breaches rose exponentially - although they do seem to have ""plateaued"" since then. The greatest prevalence of reported cyber attacks between 2013 and 2022 was seen in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, however, this does not mean that the Americas were any less impacted by this plague.Are Cybersecurity Stocks An Investment Worth Considering?In light of these developments, the Moody's survey found that between 2019 and 2023, companies and organizations grew their spending on cybersecurity by 70%. Among these respondents, corporates were reported to have increased their cybersecurity budgets the most - by 100%. At the same time, the report also highlighted the fact that those who were not insured for cyber attacks are now beginning to rush for this insurance. This is resulting in projections stating that the global cyber insurance market will grow to about $33 billion in premiums by 2027, as compared to its current value of about $12 billion in premiums.Story continuesAnother interesting thing to note in the report is how organizations are seemingly only focused on basic cybersecurity measures at the moment - sometimes referred to as ""cyber hygiene."" This is because many companies do not have the budget to implement more advanced security measures, which can put them at a disadvantage relative to other corporations that are willing to go the extra mile. However, the existence of pricier, more advanced cybersecurity solutions also means that as organizations become more aware of all the risks associated with cyber breaches, they will be further incentivized to make even bigger investments in their cybersecurity, all to the advantage of cybersecurity providers.All of these developments go to show that the cybersecurity market is set to benefit from immense growth in the near future, especially as awareness of the risks of cyber breaches and attacks is also on the rise. As a result, companies heavily invested in the cybersecurity industry, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), SentinelOne, Inc. (NYSE:S), and Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS), are expected to profit immensely as more individuals, corporations, and governments sign on for their cybersecurity products and solutions. Investors can thus benefit from keeping a close eye on cybersecurity stocks in the market today, particularly those being backed by influential hedge funds and institutional investors. Since this is appearing to be an area of rapid growth in investments, now is the right time for investors to enter this space by adding a few exceptional cybersecurity stocks to their portfolios. In light of this, we have compiled a list of some of the best cybersecurity stocks in the market today. These include stocks of some of the fastest growing cybersecurity companies, alongside those that are veterans in this industry.11 Best Cybersecurity Stocks Hedge Funds Are BuyingOur MethodologyWe used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter to find cybersecurity stocks that were popular among hedge funds in that quarter.

(NASDAQ:HAS) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 15th of November, with investors receiving $0.70 per share. This means the annual payment is 4.3% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Hasbro Hasbro's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Hasbro is unprofitable despite paying a dividend, and it is paying out 290% of its free cash flow. This makes us feel that the dividend will be hard to maintain.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio will be 8.8%, which makes us pretty comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendHasbro Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.44 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.80. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 6.9% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.Dividend Growth Is DoubtfulInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. In the last five years, Hasbro's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 7.3% per annum. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.The Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. In the past the payments have been stable, but we think the company is paying out too much for this to continue for the long term. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for Hasbro that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the covered call strategy and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Stocks for Covered Calls. What is a Covered Call Strategy?A covered call strategy is an options trading strategy where an investor holds a long position in a specific stock or other underlying asset and simultaneously sells a call option on that same asset. The objective of this strategy is to generate income from the premiums received from selling the call option while potentially benefiting from the stock's price appreciation up to a certain point.The covered call strategy has gained attention because it has historically provided appealing returns when considering the level of risk involved. The CBOE S&amp;P 500 BuyWrite Index (BXM), a benchmark index designed to track the performance of a hypothetical covered call strategy, is often said to offer similar average returns as the S&amp;P 500 Index but with about two-thirds less volatility, according to a paper published by CFA Institute. The index has delivered an 8.29% return to shareholders since the start of the year and its 12-month return came in at 11.78%, as of September 22. The report also mentioned that the covered call strategy has gained attention among investors over the years. In the 10 years that ended June 2014, the assets managed using these strategies have grown by over 25% each year.Another Goldman Sachs study from January 2012 looked at 16 years of covered call trading (from 1996 to 2011) and found that using covered call strategies improved returns and reduced risk in diversified portfolios. The advantage amounted to a 3.6% annual increase in returns and a 20% decrease in the variability of monthly returns. This improvement was based on selling covered calls that were 10% out-of-the-money and had a one-month duration on S&amp;P 500 stocks with readily tradable options. In addition to this, the study discovered that writing call options on large-cap companies was more effective than on small-cap companies. However, it didn't find a significant difference in results between value and growth stocks.Story continuesThe popularity of this investment approach is evident in the success of the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI), the largest covered call exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, with assets totaling $26.8 billion. It has not only attracted the most new investments of any actively managed ETF this year but has also become the largest actively managed ETF overall. According to VettaFi’s data, $9.7 billion has been invested in JEPI ETF this year so far. One of the main reasons for this huge inflow is that JEPI is structured to hold a ""defensive"" portfolio of stocks, further minimizing risk.Given the current market situation with continuous interest rate hikes and growing inflation, analysts advise investors to add defensive stocks to their portfolios and sell call options on these defensive securities. Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, spoke about the strategy in his interview with the Financial Times. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Covered call strategies really started to gain traction with investors last year when there was more downside in the market . . . they were a way for investors to get above average income without taking on undue risk.”For a covered call strategy, investors should consider established, large-cap, and blue-chip stocks that have a history of stability and are less likely to experience extreme price fluctuations. Some of the best stocks for covered calls include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). In this article, we will discuss some other best stocks for covered calls.What is a Covered Call? 10 Best Stocks For Covered CallsSource:PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we selected the best stocks for covered calls based on hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

(NYSE:LOW) is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential operated by a superb management team that has been successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation. In recent quarters, industrywide sales have retrenched slightly, driven by record lumber deflation, moderation in DIY discretionary demand (particularly with big-ticket items), a mix-shift from large to smaller Pro-specific projects, and a general trend of consumers reallocating budgets from goods to services. Sales remain elevated relative to 2019 baseline levels driven by a combination of price and mix, while units have largely normalized. Against this backdrop, Lowe’s headline same-store-sales growth has been modestly negative, offset by material margin expansion and the benefits of Lowe’s best-in-class share buyback program positioning the company to generate roughly flat earnings growth in 2023.

Statements from the September Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) meeting confirming another rate hike in 2023, high interest rates for longer and fewer cuts in 2024 triggered a brutal across-the-board REIT sell-off.Although the last two days of September were positive, many of the stalwart REIT leaders, such as Realty Income Corp.

Wall Street ignored the weaker year-over-year AFFO numbers and instead focused on Modiv beating estimates and increasing its revenue.Story continuesRecent insider activity is also encouraging.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Oshkosh (OSK) earns a Zacks Rank #1 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.37 a share, just 27 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 26, 2023.Oshkosh's Earnings ESP sits at 8.36%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.37 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.19.OSK is just one of a large group of Auto-Tires-Trucks stocks with a positive ESP figure. Paccar (PCAR) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Paccar, which is readying to report earnings on October 24, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $2.13 a share, and PCAR is 25 days out from its next earnings report.For Paccar, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.06 is 3.34%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, OSK and PCAR could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

(NYSE: UPS) will offer rebates to offset early-termination penalties should customers break their new contracts to return their traffic to the carrier.UPS CEO Carol B. Tomé affirmed the policy at an analyst breakfast this week, according to those in attendance. According to Ken Hoexter, analyst at Bank of America, Tomé said the costs of the rebates would be minor and would not impact the company’s or the industry’s yield focus. There were no specifics about how widespread the rebate program would be.UPS lost about 1.2 million daily parcels as shippers concerned about service disruptions shifted traffic to other carriers. Rival FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) received about 400,000 of the diverted parcels. The rest was split between the U.S. Postal Service and an array of regional delivery carriers.UPS has said it hopes to win back most, if not all, of the diverted volumes by the end of 2023 and expects year-on-year domestic parcel volume growth to return to flat by year’s end, compared to what was a 10% year-on-year drop in the second quarter. September volumes are returning at a faster clip than in August, UPS told analysts.Much of the analyst meeting focused on UPS’ attempts to leverage automation to drive down labor costs in its facilities. To offset its union contract cost — nearly half of the overall increase will occur in the first year — UPS plans to lower the 140,000 part-time employee head count inside its sort centers over the next few years, analysts were told. Collectively, these part-time unionized workers represent about $3 billion a year in potential cost savings, according to analysts attending the meeting.Language in the contract requires UPS to negotiate with the Teamsters at least 45 days before it introduces certain technology such as drones, driverless vehicles and platooning into its network. Much of the public discussion, however, centered on technology like autonomous vehicles and drones that support transportation functions. It did not address the use of robotics, for example, inside the company’s sortation centers.Story continuesIt is believed that UPS gained broader freedoms to use inside-the-facility technology in return for the significant wage increases in the contract’s first year. Increases will be muted in years two through four and re-accelerate in year five, though not as significantly as in year one.The company will expand on its labor-savings and productivity efforts in March when it hosts an investor’s day in Atlanta, where it is based.At the meeting, UPS executives acknowledged that volumes continued to be pressured by macro weakness in the U.S. and abroad. Inflation, a slowing economy and a shift in consumer expenditures from goods to services are all impacting volume growth, executives said.The post UPS offers rebates to win back diverted volumes appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Zimmer Biomet’s Knee business to drive pricing stability, mix benefit and competitive conversions. However, a difficult macroeconomic situation leading to mounting expenses puts pressure on the operating margin.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has increased 7.6% compared with the 1.2% rise of the industry and the 20.3% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The leading musculoskeletal healthcare company has a market capitalization of $23.50 billion. The company has an earnings yield of 6.78% against the industry’s -1.62%. Zimmer Biomet surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and was breakeven in one, delivering an average earnings surprise of 4.47%.Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsBusiness Recovery Continues: Zimmer Biomet has witnessed a rebound in its business for the past few quarters despite macroeconomic challenges.U.S. sales rose 5% in the second quarter, well ahead of the company’s expectations, with elective procedure volumes recovering and procedure cancellation rates returning to pre-pandemic levels. International sales grew 7.2%, driven by strong EMEA and Asia Pacific performance. All regions benefited from continued recovery of elective procedures, backlog recapture and strong commercial execution and new product uptake.Focus on Emerging Markets to Drive Growth: Over the recent past, Zimmer Biomet has been working to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets that provide long-term opportunities for growth. The company's strategic investments in these regions over the past several quarters to improve operational and sales performance are yielding results. While the integration of Biomet is over, the combined company has started to benefit from a strong presence in emerging markets with an extended portfolio that includes upper and lower joints. According to the combined company, this will help develop the extremities and trauma business in the future. Zimmer Biomet expects to establish critical mass in spine and dental that will position the company to compete effectively and gain a share in these significant markets.Story continuesGradually Stabilizing Market: Despite challenging market conditions in the form of pricing pressure, the last few quarters witnessed gradual stability in the global musculoskeletal market with better-than-expected sales growth in specific geographies, banking on improved procedural volume. This was driven by favorable demographics and the growing utilization of musculoskeletal healthcare in emerging and under-penetrated developed markets. The focused execution of the company's global sales teams amid a stable global musculoskeletal market also helped accelerate global sales for Persona, the personalized knee system.DownsidesMacroeconomic Concerns: Although Zimmer Biomet is gradually coming out of the impact of the two-and-a-half-year-long healthcare crisis, the ongoing industry-wide trend of staffing shortages and supply chain-related hazards is denting growth. Deteriorating international trade, with global inflationary pressure leading to a challenging situation related to raw material and labor costs as well as freight charges and rising interest rates all have put the dental treatment space (which is highly-elective) in a tight spot.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPricing Pressure Continues to Persist: Pricing remains a major headwind for Zimmer Biomet. The company's top-line growth in the reported quarter was partially offset by continued pricing pressure, mainly in the Americas and Europe operating segments. We remain concerned about the pricing scenario as it will be affected by cost containment efforts by governmental healthcare, local hospitals and health systems. Zimmer Biomet expects price erosion of 100-150 basis points in the second half of 2023.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Zimmer Biomet’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has increased from $7.45 to $7.51 in the past 90 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $7.40 billion.

Yet, factors like macroeconomic uncertainties, pricing pressure and unfavorable currency fluctuations continue to adversely impact Zimmer Biomet's sales. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.Zimmer Biomet has implemented four meaningful pillars inside its Knee business to drive pricing stability, mix benefit and competitive conversions. As part of the first pillar, the company is focusing on ROSA Robotic Platform combined with its Persona cementless Knee. According to the company, this is a powerhouse combination that will continue to accelerate growth. Zimmer Biomet expects ROSA and Persona together to enhance its robotics and cementless penetration from the current mid-teen level to 50% or better.The second pillar is focused on Persona revision. It provides meaningful conversion and mix opportunities inside the revision category. The third pillar involves Zimmer Biomet’s plans to work on the overall shift of the company’s legacy knee systems to a fully rounded-out Persona portfolio. The fourth pillar focuses on the development of the world's first and only Smart Knee- Persona iQ. which is in limited launch per its current status.Zimmer Biomet is witnessing a rebound in its business since the past few quarters despite macroeconomic challenges.

In addition, the company also noted acute supply challenges within Sports and Trauma. All these are creating significant pressure on the company’s operating profit. During the second quarter, Zimmer Biomet witnessed a 4.4% increase in SG&amp;A expenses and a 18.8% rise in R&amp;D expenses.Also, a substantial portion of Zimmer Biomet’s foreign revenues is generated in Europe and Japan. In recent times, significant increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and other currencies are having an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations.

If you are not interested in reading the detailed analysis of the global cocoa market, head straight to the Top 5 Cocoa Producing Countries In The World. Cocoa, often called the ""food of the gods,"" holds a special place in the global agricultural landscape. As a critical ingredient in producing chocolate and other delectable treats, it plays a pivotal role in the world's economy. The top cocoa-producing countries in the world like Ghana and Ivory Coast wield significant influence over the cocoa industry, driving its production and direction. The Global Cocoa Landscape The global cocoa market is on a robust growth trajectory, with projections indicating an impressive expansion from $48.29 billion in 2022 to an estimated $67.88 billion by 2029, showcasing a CAGR of 4.98% throughout the forecast period. This growth is mainly driven by the rising demand for cocoa ingredients, which are used in various products in the confectionery industry, non-alcoholic beverages and indulgent baked goods.The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) anticipates a 10% increase in global cocoa production over the next decade, underscoring the industry's potential. The food and beverage sector, a pivotal player in this surge, is witnessing global flourishing, with cocoa-infused products, especially chocolate, leading in new launches within beverages, bakery items, and confectionery. This trend is expected to fuel the demand for cocoa butter and cocoa powder further in the foreseeable future. The cocoa market's recent growth can be chiefly attributed to the burgeoning demand for confectionery products. This global demand for cocoa ingredients and flavors reflects their increasing presence across various food and beverage products. However, to sustain this growth, the industry must focus on maintaining sustainability, emphasizing the need for additional investments to meet these evolving market requirements. Story continuesIn light of these developments, the Sustainable Agricultural Network/Rainforest Alliance cocoa program has grown significantly over the past five years, covering 1 million hectares of cocoa production. This ambitious project impacts at least 10% of the world's cocoa output, totaling 350,000 tonnes, cultivated on 750,000 hectares by 250,000 farmers. Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is one of the world's largest chocolate manufacturers, and is renowned for their iconic confectionery brands, including Cadbury, Toblerone, and Milka. The company is deeply committed to sustainable cocoa sourcing, with a goal of sourcing 100% certified and sustainable cocoa by 2025. Mondelez pursues this vision through its Cocoa Life program, focused on enhancing the well-being of cocoa farmers and their communities, preserving forests, and advocating for gender equality in cocoa-growing regions.Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is also doing well on the market front. The company reported a robust Q2 2023 performance. Revenues surged by 17% YoY, primarily due to a 15.8% growth in Organic Net Revenue in 3 out of 4 regions. Diluted EPS rose by 27.8% to $0.69, and Adjusted EPS grew by 21.5% in constant currency. The Chief Executive Officer of Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) -- Dirk Van De Put -- said the following in the Q2 earnings call:""You can see that the first half of 2023 showed continued momentum across our entire business. We delivered the first half organic net revenue growth of $2.7 billion, up nearly 18% versus prior year and significantly ahead of our already strong 12% in full year 2022. This includes a 15.8% growth for the quarter. We also delivered adjusted gross profit dollar growth of more than $1 billion. Again, we are well ahead of last year’s pace with 18.9% growth.""Ghana, a vital player in global cocoa production, contributes 20% of the world's cocoa. The Cocoa Processing Company Limited (CPC) in Ghana, listed as ""CPC"" on the stock exchange, processes raw cocoa into iconic chocolate varieties and champions sustainability through initiatives like the Cocoa Abrabopa Association (CAA) and the Cocoa Health and Extension Division (CHED). Top 20 Cocoa Producing Countries In The WorldOur Methodology In our methodology, we ranked the world's top cocoa-producing countries for the year 2021, using data sourced from Our World in Data.Here is our list of the top 20 cocoa producing countries in the world. 20.

If that coffee passed grading, it would re-enter ICE stocks as fresh, without the penalties or price discounts the exchange applies to coffees that are sitting there for years.Those traders did not even need to move the coffee from the warehouse, according to the previous rules.The practice infuriated some roasters in the United States that were taking delivery of ICE coffees when buying futures at the exchange, and found that sometimes they were receiving coffees several years old.""It undermines the entire legitimacy of the contract. Five-year-old coffee is priced at even money, so true fresh coffee must carry an enormous premium,"" said one of the roasters after Reuters published a story about the practice last year. He asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the topic.""That depresses the value of the coffee market, and keeps differentials very abnormally high. These bastardized re-re-regrades have broken the entire system,"" he said.(Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira Editing by Chris Reese)]"

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Vertex currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.58, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 24 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.58 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 24 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy, representing 70.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for VRTXBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for VRTXCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Vertex here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Vertex, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is VRTX a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Vertex, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $14.66.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Vertex. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Vertex.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

276,ff726854-981d-3b52-93c2-3b1dea885a8a,TXT,2023-09-30,3 Top Stocks to Buy in October Despite Market Fears,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-stocks-buy-october-120000423.html,1695988800,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'TXT', 'NXPI', 'ROAD']","[Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks digs into some key stock market levels and data as the market closes out September and the third quarter on a downbeat note. Despite the wave of selling in a historically weak month for stocks, the overall bullish backdrop remains, and some indicators appear to be flashing buy signals to investors who can handle more volatility and the possibility of near-term selling.The three highly-ranked Zacks stocks we explore today are Textron (TXT), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), and Construction Partners (ROAD).The S&amp;P 500 popped on Thursday to prevent it from having to test its 200-day moving average for the first time since March. It’s possible the bears ramp up the selling to start the fourth quarter and the benchmark is forced to test its 200-day, or even its 50-week or 200-week moving averages. But there is no denying that the S&amp;P 500 appears to be rather oversold at the moment—at levels it last hit when the market bottomed at the end of Q3 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe bears keep waiting for earnings revisions to fall off a cliff. Yet, the earnings outlook is improving and the most recent Zacks data showcases that the S&amp;P 500 is projected to return to growth in Q4 and then roar back in a big way in 2024 (+12.0%) and 2025 (+11.4%), which hardly signals a major U.S. recession is right around the corner.On top of that, the Fed is near the end of its rate hiking efforts, even if it has to turn up the temperature a bit more as the U.S. labor market and economy remain sturdy. It is also worth remembering that many investors are the most excited to buy stocks at what will be the near-term highs and nervous to buy at the eventual near-term lows.First up is Aerospace–Defense industry standout Textron (TXT) which also operates commercial segments. Textron’s Arctic Cat is a leader in the small off-road vehicle space, while Cessna is a major player in private aviation. TXT’s portfolio also includes Bell, which landed a potentially massive contract with the U.S. Army in late 2022 to make its next-generation helicopters.Story continuesTextron posted an impressive beat-and-raise quarter over the summer and its upbeat EPS outlook helps it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. Zacks estimates call for TXT to post 8% revenue growth this year and another 6% next year to help boost its adjusted earnings by 32% and 7%, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTXT stock is up 190% in the last 10 years to blow away its industry’s 7% and top the S&amp;P 500’s 162%, including a 33% climb over the past 12 months and a 17% jump in Q3. Textron is attempting to hit new highs and break out of its current range. On the valuation front, Textron trades at a 24% discount to its industry and 33% below its own 10-year highs at 14.2X forward 12-month earnings.Next up is Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). NXP Semiconductors is a leading chip maker with huge exposure to the automotive industry, as well as industrial segments, IoT, mobile devices, wearables, energy infrastructure, and more. On top of that, Wall Street is starting to pay attention to NXP’s ability to benefit from the wider AI and machine learning revolution within self-driving vehicles and beyond. Zacks estimates call for the company to return to top and bottom line growth next year after it faces a slight downturn in 2023, with it up against a monster stretch of growth. NXPI trades at 14.8X forward 12-month earnings. This represents 45% value vs. its own highs, as well as a 16% discount to its industry and 34% value vs. the Zacks Tech sector despite its long-term outperformance of both. Plus, NXP Semiconductors’ dividend yields 2.1% at the moment, which is a nice bonus for a chip stock.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNXPI shares have climbed roughly 400% in the last decade vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s 225% and its Semiconductor-Analog and Mixed industry’s 380%. The stock is up 60% during the past three years to blow away Tech’s 22%. And NXP Semiconductors is currently finding support at its long-term 21-week moving average.  Last up is vertically integrated civil infrastructure firm Construction Partners, Inc. (ROAD) which specializes in road construction and maintenance across six states including Florida, North Carolina, and Georgia. Its core business is centered around publicly funded projects such as local and state highways, bridges, and more. ROAD also has a private sector, and it is one of the fastest-growing civil contractors in a booming region of the country.ROAD topped our Q3 FY23 estimates and raised its guidance to help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment. Construction Partners is projected to post 20% sales growth this year and 8% higher next year to help boost its adjusted earnings by 105% and 39%, respectively—which comes up against an impressive stretch. And the U.S. is finally focused on infrastructure spending after decades of neglect.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchROAD shares have climbed around 200% since the company’s 2018 IPO vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 60% and its industry’s 53%. The stock is up 34% YTD and it is trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Construction Partners also trades roughly in line with its own five-year median of 31.5X forward earnings and at a 53% discount to its highs.(Disclosure: Ben Rains owns NXPI in Zacks Alternative Energy Innovators service). Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

279,81f815cf-f6f7-31aa-ac5c-4547957393bf,KO,2023-09-30,What is a Covered Call? 10 Best Stocks For Covered Calls,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/covered-call-10-best-stocks-150825324.html,1696000063,STORY,"['F', 'LOW', '^GSPC', 'PEP', 'COP', 'KO', 'WMT', 'MCD']","[In this article, we discuss what is a covered call and 10 best stocks to buy or covered calls. You can skip our detailed analysis of the covered call strategy and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Stocks for Covered Calls. What is a Covered Call Strategy?A covered call strategy is an options trading strategy where an investor holds a long position in a specific stock or other underlying asset and simultaneously sells a call option on that same asset. The objective of this strategy is to generate income from the premiums received from selling the call option while potentially benefiting from the stock's price appreciation up to a certain point.The covered call strategy has gained attention because it has historically provided appealing returns when considering the level of risk involved. The CBOE S&amp;P 500 BuyWrite Index (BXM), a benchmark index designed to track the performance of a hypothetical covered call strategy, is often said to offer similar average returns as the S&amp;P 500 Index but with about two-thirds less volatility, according to a paper published by CFA Institute. The index has delivered an 8.29% return to shareholders since the start of the year and its 12-month return came in at 11.78%, as of September 22. The report also mentioned that the covered call strategy has gained attention among investors over the years. In the 10 years that ended June 2014, the assets managed using these strategies have grown by over 25% each year.Another Goldman Sachs study from January 2012 looked at 16 years of covered call trading (from 1996 to 2011) and found that using covered call strategies improved returns and reduced risk in diversified portfolios. The advantage amounted to a 3.6% annual increase in returns and a 20% decrease in the variability of monthly returns. This improvement was based on selling covered calls that were 10% out-of-the-money and had a one-month duration on S&amp;P 500 stocks with readily tradable options. In addition to this, the study discovered that writing call options on large-cap companies was more effective than on small-cap companies. However, it didn't find a significant difference in results between value and growth stocks.Story continuesThe popularity of this investment approach is evident in the success of the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI), the largest covered call exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, with assets totaling $26.8 billion. It has not only attracted the most new investments of any actively managed ETF this year but has also become the largest actively managed ETF overall. According to VettaFi’s data, $9.7 billion has been invested in JEPI ETF this year so far. One of the main reasons for this huge inflow is that JEPI is structured to hold a ""defensive"" portfolio of stocks, further minimizing risk.Given the current market situation with continuous interest rate hikes and growing inflation, analysts advise investors to add defensive stocks to their portfolios and sell call options on these defensive securities. Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, spoke about the strategy in his interview with the Financial Times. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Covered call strategies really started to gain traction with investors last year when there was more downside in the market . . . they were a way for investors to get above average income without taking on undue risk.”For a covered call strategy, investors should consider established, large-cap, and blue-chip stocks that have a history of stability and are less likely to experience extreme price fluctuations. Some of the best stocks for covered calls include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). In this article, we will discuss some other best stocks for covered calls.What is a Covered Call? 10 Best Stocks For Covered CallsSource:PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we selected the best stocks for covered calls based on hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. The companies mentioned below are blue-chip stocks with a history of performing well over the long term. Moreover, these companies also pay dividends to shareholders.

Here is what the firm has to say:Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential operated by a superb management team that has been successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation. In recent quarters, industrywide sales have retrenched slightly, driven by record lumber deflation, moderation in DIY discretionary demand (particularly with big-ticket items), a mix-shift from large to smaller Pro-specific projects, and a general trend of consumers reallocating budgets from goods to services. Sales remain elevated relative to 2019 baseline levels driven by a combination of price and mix, while units have largely normalized. Against this backdrop, Lowe’s headline same-store-sales growth has been modestly negative, offset by material margin expansion and the benefits of Lowe’s best-in-class share buyback program positioning the company to generate roughly flat earnings growth in 2023.

For more companies, head on over to Top 5 Cloud Computing Companies in USA.Cloud computing is one of the hottest buzzwords in the tech market today. But where did this word come from? Some accounts believe that the word dates back to 2006, when the big tech companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Google at that time, began using “cloud computing” to define a new segment of computer software services and file management across the Web. According to the MIT Technology Review, the term “cloud computing” was first used in 1996 at the offices of Compaq Computer, when tech executives were designing the future of the internet, calling it “cloud computing.” Nevertheless, the world got to know more about this technology when companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) began to push cloud computing efforts. One of the first articles covered on cloud computing was on November 15, 2007, when The New York Times reported the headline “I.B.M. to Push ‘Cloud Computing,’ Using Data From Afar.” The article addressed the beginning of internet-based supercomputing. Market OutlookCloud computing is one of the largest segments in IT and it continues to grow considering the increasing demand for cloud products and services across industries, institutions, companies, and governments. The US remains a prominent market, with some of the biggest cloud computing companies in the world operating in the region. The current economic circumstances have created a rift in cloud spending, but the market continues to grow at a healthy rate despite short-term market disruptions. On August 3, Synergy Research Group posted the data of the cloud computing enterprise spending for the second quarter of 2023. During Q2 2023, the global enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services was around $65 billion, up by $10 billion year over year. This marks the third consecutive quarter in which the cloud market spending grew by $10 billion. Story continuesAccording to Gartner, global IT spending is forecasted to reach $4.7 trillion in 2023, a rise of 4.3% from 2022. Despite the uncertainty in the market due to economic disruption, the cloud computing industry continues to remain resilient. In 2023, the global end-user spending on public cloud services is estimated to grow by 20.7% from 2022-levels to $591.8 billion. Gartner has also projected that global public cloud services will grow by 20.1% in 2023, compared to 2022.USA Cloud Computing Companies by Market ShareThe US has the largest cloud computing market compared to the rest of the world. According to Fortune Business Insights, the cloud computing market size of North America stood at $401.49 billion in 2022, while the global cloud computing market was reported at $569.31 billion in 2022.

283,8d343d51-1139-3acd-ae0f-6b95a1ae6a09,SYK,2023-09-30,13 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-robotics-stocks-buy-200517569.html,1696017917,STORY,"['EMR', 'ROK', 'DE', 'ZBRA', 'SYK', 'SPLK', 'TER', 'ISRG', 'TMO']","[In this article, we discuss the 13 best robotics stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our discussion on the robotics industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy Now.According to Precedence Research, the size of the robotics industry stood at $72.2 billion at the end of 2022. The industry is predicted to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.7% from 2022 to 2032 to reach a size of $283.2 billion. Based on the product type of robots, traditional industrial robots dominate the market with a 52% market share in 2022. Meanwhile, collaborative robots or cobots are the fastest-growing product segment as they are designed to help people perform their tasks with a better level of precision and sophistication. In terms of components, the hardware segment accounts for 72% of the market share. The remaining 28% of the market share is captured by software and services segments. When it comes to specific industry applications, manufacturing takes the lead, accounting for a substantial 68% of the market's top-line share. In terms of geography, the Asia Pacific region generates the most revenue, with a share of 46% in 2022. Within the Asia Pacific region, China leads as it has a track record of being responsible for 50% of all global installations taking place in the region over the years.Robotics Industry's Growth ProspectsAccording to the International Federation of Robotics, unit sales of industrial robots compounded at an average annual rate of 7% from 2017 to 2022. Meanwhile, annual unit sales of robots increased by 5% YoY to reach 553,032 in 2022. Overall, in the manufacturing industry, the global density of robots stood at 151 robots per 10,000 employees, and the stock of industrial robots stood at 3.91 million. The IFR anticipates a 7% annual average growth rate in the next three years, which would result in annual installations of 718,000 units by 2026. One of the reasons for the strong demand for industrial robots is significant investments in car manufacturing facilities and the overall modernization of industrial facilities across various sectors. You can also check out the Top 10 Industrial Robotics Companies in the World here, which play pivotal roles in this dynamic industry.Story continuesAccording to Mordor Intelligence, there is a strong demand for industrial robots in the healthcare sector as well. As per the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the most hazardous jobs in the US are performed by employees in the healthcare sector, exposing workers to the highest rates of on-the-job illnesses and non-fatal injuries. According to estimates, there are already 6,000 robots worldwide that are performing one million surgeries annually. Another sector that is a strong end-market for the robotics industry is the building maintenance industry. As per the US Bureau of Labor, there are 2.38 million janitors and cleaners employed across the US, and companies spend around $60 billion annually on these services. This amount does not include the insurance payouts, which are substantial as well due to the risky nature of the job. The heightened risk factor is one of the primary reasons for a stronger demand for cleaning robots. Cleaning robots have already made significant headways in the consumer segment. Around 19 million robots that performed domestic tasks were sold during 2022, marking an impressive year-over-year (YoY) increase of 12% in the largest consumer robot category.The healthy growth outlook of the robotics industry can also be attributed to the global aging population, as the need for robots is expected to rise due to their increased requirement in assistance living and domestic healthcare services. According to the United Nations (UN), every sixth person in the world will be above the age of 65 by the middle of this century as opposed to one in 11 people currently. Meanwhile, in Europe, one in every fourth person could be older than 65 by 2050. The number of population above the age of 80 is anticipated to triple from 143 million in 2019 to 426 million in 2050. The Japanese government is already embracing the impact of an aging population and a shortage of skilled staff as it has announced funding to make up for a gap of 380,000 skilled employees by 2025.Investment Opportunities in Robotics and AutomationIn addition to investing in the best robotics stocks, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

The focused execution of the company's global sales teams amid a stable global musculoskeletal market also helped accelerate global sales for Persona, the personalized knee system.DownsidesMacroeconomic Concerns: Although Zimmer Biomet is gradually coming out of the impact of the two-and-a-half-year-long healthcare crisis, the ongoing industry-wide trend of staffing shortages and supply chain-related hazards is denting growth. Deteriorating international trade, with global inflationary pressure leading to a challenging situation related to raw material and labor costs as well as freight charges and rising interest rates all have put the dental treatment space (which is highly-elective) in a tight spot.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPricing Pressure Continues to Persist: Pricing remains a major headwind for Zimmer Biomet. The company's top-line growth in the reported quarter was partially offset by continued pricing pressure, mainly in the Americas and Europe operating segments. We remain concerned about the pricing scenario as it will be affected by cost containment efforts by governmental healthcare, local hospitals and health systems. Zimmer Biomet expects price erosion of 100-150 basis points in the second half of 2023.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Zimmer Biomet’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has increased from $7.45 to $7.51 in the past 90 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $7.40 billion.

O. Smith Corp. AOS and EnerSys ENS.Industry: ElectronicsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2157057/3-manufacturing-electronics-stocks-to-gain-from-improving-supply-chainsWhile weakness in the manufacturing sector is dampening demand in the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry, recent signs of an uptick in manufacturing activities hold promise. Improving supply chains, deceleration in inflation, focus on digitization and inorganic activities are expected to foster growth of the industry. Resiliency in some prominent end markets bodes well for these companies.Amid buoyant near-term prospects, companies like Eaton Corporation plc, A. O. Smith Corp. and EnerSys are poised for growth.About the IndustryThe Zacks Manufacturing-Electronics industry comprises companies that manufacture electronic products like battery chargers, battery accessories, outdoor cabinet enclosures, power transmission products, electrical motion controls and motive power devices. Some industry players also provide water-treatment products, engineered flow components, process equipment and turn-key systems. These companies also offer state-of-the-art customer support and after-market services to end users.These companies are increasing investments in developing innovative technologies, boosting customer and employee experience, as well as supply-chain modernization programs. The manufacturing electronic companies sell products and services in various end markets, including robotics, semiconductor, defense, aerospace, medical equipment and satellite communications.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Manufacturing Electronics IndustryPersistent Weakness in the Manufacturing Sector: Continued weakness in the manufacturing sector has been weighing on demand in the industry. Per the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report, in August, the Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Manager's Index) touched 47.6%, contracting for the 10th consecutive month. A figure less than 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. The New Orders Index remained in the contraction territory at 46.8%, declining 0.5 percentage points from the figure recorded in July.Story continuesWhile the manufacturing sector remains in the contraction territory, it is showing signs of gradual improvement. The Manufacturing PMI has been steadily improving over the past few months. In August, the index increased 1.2 percentage points from the figure recorded in July. The uptick in manufacturing activities augurs well for the manufacturing electronics industry.End-Market Strength: Despite a slowdown in manufacturing activities, demand across key end markets remains stable. Well-diversified end markets, such as gas, mining, refining, energy, renewable, life sciences, metals, electrification and automation, should help industry players offset weakness in demand associated with a single market. Additionally, the digitalization of business operations is helping industry participants boost their competitiveness through enhanced operational productivity, product quality and better cost management. Inorganic growth strategies bode well for the industry's prospects.Easing Supply-Chain Disruptions: While supply-chain disruptions persist, especially related to the availability of electronic components, the situation has improved, as evident from the ISM report's Supplier Deliveries Index, which reflected faster deliveries for the 11th straight month in August. Easing supply-chain issues should support manufacturing electronics companies' growth in 2023. Additionally, a reduction in raw material costs, thanks to the deceleration in inflation, should aid the bottom line of manufacturing electronics companies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Manufacturing – Electronics industry, housed within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #83. This rank places it in the top 34% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Aflac in FocusHeadquartered in Columbus, Aflac (AFL) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 7.97% so far this year. The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.42 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.16%. This compares to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.64% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.7%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 12.36%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Aflac's payout ratio is 30%, which means it paid out 30% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, AFL expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $6 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 12.57%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, AFL presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Per the American Society of Civil Engineers, water main breaks occur every two minutes in the United States due to the aging of the existing water infrastructure, resulting in the wastage of millions of gallons of potable water.Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, an estimated $744 billion investment is necessary to maintain and expand drinking water and wastewater services to meet demand over the next 20 years.Too many small water service providers work in the United States and the lack of financial strength of the small operators creates operational challenges in meeting the requirement for replacement and adding to the aging water and wastewater infrastructure. Large water utility companies continue to acquire small players to ensure the extension of high-quality services to customers and the investment required to upgrade old and acquired assets.American Water Works, through its subsidiaries, is making systematic acquisitions and taking essential steps to upgrade the old infrastructure of its acquired assets. AWK has added 7,100 customers till Jun 30, 2023, by acquiring five companies. The company’s pending acquisitions (as of Jun 30, 2023), when completed, will add another 74,800 customers to its customer base. In addition, AWK has long-term investment plans to upgrade and expand its water infrastructure and efficiently serve customers.Another water utility, Essential Utilities WTRG, is also making acquisitions to expand its operations. Since 2015, Essential Utilities has expanded utility operations by completing many water and wastewater acquisitions, adding 129,000 customers. The six acquisitions completed in 2023 added 11,025 customers. At present, there are four pending acquisition deals for a total purchase price of $335.8 million, which, when completed, will add 208,000 customers to its existing customer base.Essential Utilities plans to invest $1.1 billion annually in the 2023-2025 period to further strengthen its water and natural gas operations.Another utility, California Water Service Group CWT, is also expanding operations through inorganic routes. In June 2023, California Water’s unit, New Mexico Water, received approval from the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission to acquire the assets of Monterey Water Company and provide regulated water utility service to Monterey’s customers.California Water Service is expected to invest $360 million and $365 million in 2023 and 2024, respectively, to upgrade its infrastructure and efficiently serve its expanding customer base.Story continuesPrice PerformanceOver the past three months, shares of AWK have lost 13.4% compared with the industry’s 10.8% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Ranks &amp; Another Stock to ConsiderAmerican Water currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another top-ranked company from the same industry is American States Water AWR, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

307,bb0aa16a-5bfd-395e-945a-f93d862dce5a,AWK,2023-09-30,American Water Works (AWK) Could Be a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-water-works-awk-could-154509935.html,1696002309,STORY,['AWK'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.American Water Works in FocusAmerican Water Works (AWK) is headquartered in Camden, and is in the Utilities sector. The stock has seen a price change of -18.92% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.71 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.29%. In comparison, the Utility - Water Supply industry's yield is 2.15%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.7%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.83 is up 10.2% from last year. In the past five-year period, American Water Works has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 9.52%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, American Water Works's payout ratio is 59%, which means it paid out 59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.AWK is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.80 per share, with earnings expected to increase 6.43% from the year ago period.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that AWK is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:FCX),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-freeport-mcmoran-120026649.html,1696075226,STORY,['FCX'],"[Key InsightsFreeport-McMoRan's estimated fair value is US$45.39 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityFreeport-McMoRan's US$37.29 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimateOur fair value estimate is 2.6% lower than Freeport-McMoRan's analyst price target of US$46.61How far off is Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.21bUS$7.10bUS$7.91bUS$6.04bUS$5.04bUS$4.48bUS$4.17bUS$3.99bUS$3.90bUS$3.86bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -16.60%Est @ -10.97%Est @ -7.04%Est @ -4.28%Est @ -2.35%Est @ -1.00% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% US$4.8kUS$6.1kUS$6.2kUS$4.4kUS$3.4kUS$2.8kUS$2.4kUS$2.1kUS$1.9kUS$1.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$36bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.9b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.2%) = US$65bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$65b÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$29bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$65b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$37.3, the company appears about fair value at a 18% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Freeport-McMoRan as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.220. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Freeport-McMoRanStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Metals and Mining market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the covered call strategy and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Stocks for Covered Calls. What is a Covered Call Strategy?A covered call strategy is an options trading strategy where an investor holds a long position in a specific stock or other underlying asset and simultaneously sells a call option on that same asset. The objective of this strategy is to generate income from the premiums received from selling the call option while potentially benefiting from the stock's price appreciation up to a certain point.The covered call strategy has gained attention because it has historically provided appealing returns when considering the level of risk involved. The CBOE S&amp;P 500 BuyWrite Index (BXM), a benchmark index designed to track the performance of a hypothetical covered call strategy, is often said to offer similar average returns as the S&amp;P 500 Index but with about two-thirds less volatility, according to a paper published by CFA Institute. The index has delivered an 8.29% return to shareholders since the start of the year and its 12-month return came in at 11.78%, as of September 22. The report also mentioned that the covered call strategy has gained attention among investors over the years. In the 10 years that ended June 2014, the assets managed using these strategies have grown by over 25% each year.Another Goldman Sachs study from January 2012 looked at 16 years of covered call trading (from 1996 to 2011) and found that using covered call strategies improved returns and reduced risk in diversified portfolios. The advantage amounted to a 3.6% annual increase in returns and a 20% decrease in the variability of monthly returns. This improvement was based on selling covered calls that were 10% out-of-the-money and had a one-month duration on S&amp;P 500 stocks with readily tradable options. In addition to this, the study discovered that writing call options on large-cap companies was more effective than on small-cap companies. However, it didn't find a significant difference in results between value and growth stocks.Story continuesThe popularity of this investment approach is evident in the success of the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI), the largest covered call exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, with assets totaling $26.8 billion. It has not only attracted the most new investments of any actively managed ETF this year but has also become the largest actively managed ETF overall. According to VettaFi’s data, $9.7 billion has been invested in JEPI ETF this year so far. One of the main reasons for this huge inflow is that JEPI is structured to hold a ""defensive"" portfolio of stocks, further minimizing risk.Given the current market situation with continuous interest rate hikes and growing inflation, analysts advise investors to add defensive stocks to their portfolios and sell call options on these defensive securities. Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, spoke about the strategy in his interview with the Financial Times. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Covered call strategies really started to gain traction with investors last year when there was more downside in the market . . . they were a way for investors to get above average income without taking on undue risk.”For a covered call strategy, investors should consider established, large-cap, and blue-chip stocks that have a history of stability and are less likely to experience extreme price fluctuations. Some of the best stocks for covered calls include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). In this article, we will discuss some other best stocks for covered calls.What is a Covered Call? 10 Best Stocks For Covered CallsSource:PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we selected the best stocks for covered calls based on hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

(NYSE:LOW) is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential operated by a superb management team that has been successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation. In recent quarters, industrywide sales have retrenched slightly, driven by record lumber deflation, moderation in DIY discretionary demand (particularly with big-ticket items), a mix-shift from large to smaller Pro-specific projects, and a general trend of consumers reallocating budgets from goods to services. Sales remain elevated relative to 2019 baseline levels driven by a combination of price and mix, while units have largely normalized. Against this backdrop, Lowe’s headline same-store-sales growth has been modestly negative, offset by material margin expansion and the benefits of Lowe’s best-in-class share buyback program positioning the company to generate roughly flat earnings growth in 2023.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for odronextamab to treat adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) or R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who have progressed after at least two prior systemic therapies. The target action date for the FDA decision is March 31, 2024. Odronextamab is an investigational CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody designed to bridge CD20 on cancer cells with CD3-expressing T cells to facilitate local T-cell activation and cancer-cell killing.The BLA was supported by data from a Phase 1 and pivotal Phase 2 trial (ELM-1 and ELM-2). Results from these studies investigating odronextamab in both FL and DLBCL were last presented at the 64th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.The FDA previously granted odronextamab Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Designation for FL and DLBCL. In August, the European Medicines Agency accepted for review a Marketing Authorization Application for odronextamab for the treatment of adult patients with R/R FL or R/R DLBCL who have progressed after at least two prior systemic therapies.FL and DLBCL are the two most common subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). FL is a slow-growing subtype, and although many patients are responsive to initial treatment, approximately 20% are expected to relapse within two years and have shorter remissions with each successive line of therapy. DLBCL is an aggressive subtype, with up to 50% of high-risk patients experiencing progression after first-line treatment (e.g., relapsing or refractory to treatment). As these blood cancers progress, they become increasingly hard to treat, especially in the third-line setting and beyond, leaving patients with few treatment options.Story continuesOdronextamab is currently under clinical development, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Odronextamab Clinical ProgramELM-1 is an ongoing, open-label, multicenter Phase 1 trial to investigate the safety and tolerability of odronextamab in patients with CD20+ B-cell malignancies previously treated with CD20-directed antibody therapy, including an expansion cohort evaluating DLBCL patients who had progressed on CAR-T therapy (post-CAR-T). ELM-2 is an ongoing, open-label, multicenter pivotal Phase 2 trial investigating odronextamab in 375 patients across five independent disease-specific cohorts, including DLBCL, FL, mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and other subtypes of B-NHL. The primary endpoint of ELM-2 is objective response rate according to the Lugano Classification, and secondary endpoints include complete response, progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response, disease control rate, safety and quality of life.Regeneron is also initiating a broad Phase 3 development program to investigate odronextamab in earlier lines of therapy and other B-NHLs, representing one of the largest clinical programs in lymphoma.About Regeneron’s Approach to Cancer ResearchAt Regeneron, we’re applying more than three decades of scientific innovation with the goal of developing paradigm-changing therapies for patients with cancer.Our portfolio is built around two foundational approaches – our approved PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc) and investigational bispecific antibodies – which are being evaluated both as monotherapies and in combination with emerging therapeutic modalities.
