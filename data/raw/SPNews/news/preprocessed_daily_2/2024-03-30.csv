If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on retirement uncertainties, you may go to 5 Worst Places to Retire if You Have No Savings.', ""Americans aren’t feeling great about their financial futures. Everything from the pandemic, to the inflation, and market volatility, has significantly dampened their morale. According to a BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) Read on Retirement Survey, only about half of workplace savers feel that they are on track to retire with the lifestyle they desire. This percentage was 68% back in 2021 but dropped to a mere 56% in 2023. So what is hampering retirement confidence for workers around the USA? BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) highlights four key stressors. According to them, increased market volatility, high levels of inflation, recessionary fear, and a lack of retirement income are forcing individuals to delay their retirement plans. While these concerns weigh heavily on savers, the flip side of the coin doesn't yield contrasting findings. The BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) Read on Retirement Report highlights that plan sponsors are just as worried, with 3 out of 4 revealing their concerns about inflation eroding their participants’ retirement savings."", 'Adding to the complexity are the myriad financial responsibilities, with retirees struggling with a financial vortex assumingly at play, notes The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). This financial vortex is inhibiting savers from adequately saving for their retirement years. Moreover, a survey from The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) reveals that Americans now believe they need at least $1.8 million in savings to retire comfortably anyway. Sadly, the median retirement savings for baby boomers stands at $202,000 only. The substantial disparity between retirement savings and the ideal retirement threshold, as highlighted by the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) survey, is further eroded by the financial challenges identified as a vortex by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). In essence, this points to a stark reality: retirees are inevitably faced with the need to scale down their lifestyles during retirement. This is what a majority of retirees are doing anyway, according to reports by U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) and Hire a Helper.', 'According to U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL), the top growth states for 2023 were Texas, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. These are the best places to retire with no money, considering the various financial advantages they bring to their residents.', '“While one-way transactions in 2023 remained below the record-breaking levels we witnessed immediately following the pandemic, we continued to see many of the same geographical trends from U-Haul customers moving between states”.', '- John “J.T.” Taylor, U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) International president.', 'For states like Texas and Florida, the advantages are pretty clear. These are one of the few states that don’t tax retirement income, \xa0so all income to the residents goes tax-free at the state level. Add in the advantages of low cost of living and pleasant weather, and these states present themselves as ideal candidates for retirement. Since a majority of retirees largely depend on Social Security benefits only, they may choose to retire to any of the states that don’t tax Social Security benefits, depending on other factors such as proximity to family, healthcare, and other factors important to them. Rightly so, taxes shouldn’t be the only factor to consider for potential retirees making a move.', ""“Whether you're a retiree, a remote worker, or just looking for a change of scenery, the idea of pulling up stakes for purportedly greener pastures isn't that unusual these days. However, the tax implications can be profound, so it's smart to take a hard look before you break out the packing tape”."", '-Hayden Adams, director of tax and financial planning at The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) Center for Financial Research.', 'In conclusion, it is safe to say that potential retirees are largely interested in retiring to places that can give them the best bang for their buck. We already have crafted a list of the best places to retire if you have no savings, here is a list of worst places to steer clear of.', 'f11photo/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile the list of worst places to retire if you have no savings, we began by listing out the worst states to retire on social security and the worst states to retire in 2024.

2,a98ea4d6-2d9b-3042-b6f1-4f85121849b4,WDC,2024-03-30,4 Spectacular Growth Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying in the New Nasdaq Bull Market,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a98ea4d6-2d9b-3042-b6f1-4f85121849b4/4-spectacular-growth-stocks.html,1711789560,STORY,"['GOOG', 'COMP', 'LOVE', 'WDC', 'FSLY']","[""For the lion's share of this decade, volatility has ruled the roost on Wall Street. Beginning in 2020, all three major stock indexes began vacillating between bear and bull markets in successive years (not including 2024), with the growth stock-focused Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) seeing the largest percentage swings."", ""After losing a third of its value during the 2022 bear market, the Nasdaq Composite has catapulted higher by 57% since the beginning of 2023 and taken out its previous high. There's no question that the innovation-fueled index is in the early stages of a bull market."", ""But here's the thing about Wall Street's major indexes: Value can always be uncovered, no matter how pricey stocks may seem as a whole. Even with the Nasdaq rocketing to fresh highs, patient investors can still find growth stocks trading at a discount."", ""What follows are four spectacular growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market."", 'The first awe-inspiring growth stock you\'ll be kicking yourself for not grabbing with the Nasdaq Composite in a fresh bull market is ""Magnificent Seven"" member Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). Alphabet is the parent of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube, among its many ventures.', ""The only reason Alphabet hasn't completely blown the roof off of its previous high set in 2021 has to do with uncertainties tied to the advertising industry. In 2023, approximately 76% of Alphabet's $86.3 billion in net sales traced back to its vast advertising platforms. With a couple of money-based metrics (e.g., M2 money supply) and recession-predicting tools pointing to a potential downturn in the U.S. economy, ad-driven companies like Alphabet are at risk for near-term weakness."", ""But even though recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle, they're over relatively quick. Only three recessions since the end of World War II have reached the one-year mark, with none surpassing 18 months. Comparatively, most periods of growth endure for multiple years, which is fantastic news for ad-driven businesses."", 'Alphabet\'s operating ""heart and soul"" continues to be its internet search engine. In February, Google accounted for a 92% share of worldwide internet search, which is a practical monopoly. Being the undisputed leader means businesses are willing to pay Google a premium to get their message(s) in front of users.', ""But the latter half of the decade should see Google Cloud play a larger role in Alphabet's cash flow generation. Google Cloud is the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform by spend (as of September, per Canalys), and it just closed out its first year of profitability. Cloud-service margins are more robust than advertising margins, which should lead to a sizable boost to Alphabet's operating cash flow in the years to come."", 'The icing on the cake is that Alphabet is valued at 13.5 times forward-year cash flow estimates, which represents a 24% discount to its five-year average multiple to cash flow.', 'Amazing deals can be found in under-the-radar companies as well. The second spectacular growth stock you\'ll regret not adding to your portfolio with the Nasdaq Composite finding its stride is furniture stock Lovesac (NASDAQ: LOVE). Yes, I said ""furniture stock"" and ""growth stock"" in the same sentence.', 'Typically, furniture companies are slow-growing, heavily reliant on brick-and-mortar stores, and they purchase their goods from the same small group of wholesalers. Lovesac is completely altering this perception with its furniture and sales approach.', 'The obvious differentiator for Lovesac is the company\'s products. Specifically, about 90% of its revenue comes from selling ""sactionals"" -- modular couches that buyers can rearrange dozens of ways to fit most living spaces. The yarn used in sactional covers is made entirely from recycled plastic water bottles, and buyers have more than 200 different covers to choose from. No other product offers this combination of functionality, optionality, and eco-friendliness in the furniture space.', ""Something else key to Lovesac's ongoing success is its targeting of well-to-do consumers. Lovesac's unique products come with an assortment of upgrade options, including built-in surround sound and wireless charging, which can lift the price of sactionals well above a traditional sectional couch. Thankfully, this isn't an issue, since its core, higher-earning customer is rarely fazed by minor economic disruptions."", ""What ties everything together for Lovesac is its omnichannel sales platform. While it does have a traditional brick-and-mortar presence in 40 states, it's notably leaned on pop-up showrooms, brand-name partnerships (e.g., Costco Wholesale and Best Buy), and digital sales, as a means to reduce its overhead expenses and boost margins."", ""Despite low double-digit sales growth, Lovesac's stock is valued at just 10 times forward-year earnings."", ""The third eye-catching growth stock you'll regret not buying with the Nasdaq bull market finding its footing is storage solutions specialist Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC)."", 'There are often two prevailing headwinds for data storage companies. The first (as would be expected) is the health of the U.S. economy. Tech stocks are usually cyclical, so any potential for a downturn in the economy is likely to weigh on the storage industry.', 'The other is the overzealousness of storage companies. When pricing improves, they have a tendency to flood the market with supply and hurt their own margins.', 'The good news for Western Digital is that it should enjoy exceptional demand throughout the remainder of the decade on two fronts. First, enterprise cloud spending is still arguably early in its ramp-up. Researchers at Fortune Business Insights expect the global cloud computing market to grow by an annualized rate of 20% through 2030, ultimately reaching $2.43 trillion. As enterprise cloud expands, so does the need for storage solutions.', ""To add to this, Western Digital's NAND flash-memory solutions are ideally positioned to benefit from growing enterprise cloud needs. The higher transfer rates associated with NAND flash memory may make it an enterprise data-center staple by the turn of the decade."", ""Western Digital can also benefit from the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Analysts at PwC believe AI can add over $15 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030. As the computational needs of AI-accelerated data centers grows, Western Digital's storage solutions will be in higher demand."", ""The valuation makes sense, too. With the sales forecast to grow by nearly 50% over the next four years, Western Digital's forward-year price-to-earnings ratio of 11 is a bargain."", ""A fourth spectacular growth stock you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market is edge computing company Fastly (NYSE: FSLY). The company is best known for its content delivery network (CDN), which moves data from the edge of the cloud to end users as quickly and securely as possible."", ""The reason Fastly has underperformed over the past three years is its bottom line. Wider-than-expected losses and sizable share-based compensation under the company's previous CEO, Joshua Bixby, turned investors off to this growth story. However, the arrival of Todd Nightingale as the company's new CEO can change everything."", ""Nightingale officially took over in September 2022 and filled in key pieces of the puzzle that were missing. He previously worked as the lead for Cisco Systems' Enterprise Networking and Cloud segment. Not only does he have a keen understanding of what initiatives Fastly should tackle to grow its enterprise customer base, but he knows where costs can be reduced to move Fastly toward recurring profitability. Consensus estimates call for Fastly to reach recurring profits in 2025."", 'Similarly to Western Digital, Fastly is set to benefit from the steady shift of enterprise data online and into the cloud. As everything becomes more digital, end user demand for content grows. Since Fastly is a usage-driven platform, this is a recipe for higher gross profit.', ""Another reason long-term-minded investors can be excited about Fastly's prospects is that many of its key performance indicators are pointing higher. Average enterprise customer spend has increased 16% to $880,000 since March 31, 2022, while its dollar-based net expansion rate (DBNER) has stuck like molasses to the 118% to 123% range over the last eight quarters. What DBNER shows is that existing customers are spending between 18% and 23% more on a year-over-year basis."", ""Fastly's expected annualized earnings growth rate of 30% over the next five years makes it a premier growth stock to own."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

Over the last few months, however, inflation numbers have started stagnating. Latest data indicates that even though inflation was clocked at 3.2% in February, up slightly from 3.1% at the end of January, the annual rate of inflation actually slipped from 3.9% at the end of January to 3.8% at the end of last month. The central bank aims to bring this number down to around 2% and pave the way to a loosening of monetary policy.\xa0', 'Coupled with the resilience in the labor market, financial experts predict that positive growth numbers from the end of 2023 extend the runway for the central bank to act to bring down rates. Torsten Slok, the chief economist at private equity firm Apollo Global, recently told Financial Times that if the financial conditions continued to ease like they had done over the past few months, growth will likely remain strong, He also forecast that such conditions would allow the Federal Reserve to delay rate cuts. Ellen Zentner, the chief US economist at investment advisory Morgan Stanley, echoed these comments, noting that strong growth would extend the runway the Fed has to act over rate cuts.\xa0', 'Despite uncertainty regarding financial policy, investors at the stock market have been bullish on the health of the US economy.

Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.', 'Citi’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion.

Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions.

With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, the system is unable to answer questions unrelated to making travel reservations.

According to a report by the US Department of Agriculture, in 2022, agriculture and related industries contributed $1.42 trillion to the GDP of the country. The large contribution corresponded to 5.5% of the overall GDP. The hefty amount of $223.5 billion came directly from the outputs of America's farms and accounted for 0.9% of the global GDP. Although agriculture directly contributes a certain percentage, 0.9%, to the GDP, its overall impact on the economy is greater than this percentage suggests.

Another 19.6 million jobs were supported by employment in industries related to agriculture and food. The largest portion of these jobs, around 12.7 million, was in food services, including eating and drinking establishments, while food and beverage stores supported 3.3 million jobs. The remaining agriculture-related industries contributed an additional 3.5 million jobs to the economy.', ""One of the latest trends in the agriculture industry is innovation in agriculture inputs.

That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).', 'Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors.

First and foremost, it's the biggest retailer in the world with nearly $650 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. Its more than 10,600 stores carry everything from groceries to home goods to auto parts and more."", ""In short, investors can always expect consumers will patronize Walmart -- it sells almost everything and its massive stores are conveniently located to serve communities throughout the country. In other words, it's not a business that investors need to worry about."", ""Here's another positive: Walmart's e-commerce operations are now a $100 billion annual business. And having a digital platform of this scale allows the company to grow its advertising business, which will be an important driver for profits in the coming years."", ""That said, it's possible to criticize Walmart stock from an investment perspective right now. When looking at the stock's valuation from multiple perspectives, this is one of the least timely moments to buy it in the past decade."", ""Walmart's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is at a 10-year high. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is higher than the average for the S&P 500. And the company's dividend yield is at a 10-year low."", ""Therefore, I want to highlight three other discount retail chains I like more than Walmart as investment opportunities right now: Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings (NASDAQ: OLLI), Five Below (NASDAQ: FIVE), and Dollar General (NYSE: DG)."", ""Earnings growth tends to drive rising stock prices, and that's good news for shareholders of Ollie's. The pandemic hit the company's profitability, creating supply chain issues and added labor expenses. But Ollie's bounced back in 2023 with a huge 74% increase in operating income, and future growth seems likely."", ""In 2024, Ollie's plans to open 48 new locations, which is nice growth from the 512 locations it had at the end of 2023. And investors can expect new openings at a rapid clip for some time, considering management just increased its long-term goal to 1,300 stores."", ""Profit margins for Ollie's have historically held steady as it has grown. This is a good reason to believe that management has a handle on the business and can keep profitability strong as it expands. Therefore, with hundreds of new stores in the pipeline, I expect earnings to increase for Ollie's, leading to upside for the stock price."", ""The investment thesis for Five Below is similar to that of Ollie's: The company has profitable stores and plans to open many more, leading to earnings growth and upside for investors. The difference between these two, however, is that Five Below has a more defined (and aggressive) timeline."", 'There were more than 1,500 Five Below locations at the end of 2023. But management intends to have more than 2,600 locations by the end of 2026 and more than 3,500 locations by the end of 2030.', 'Keep in mind that Five Below is completely debt-free because its cost to open a new store is relatively low and the payback period is just one year. Think of it like a cash-flow snowball rolling downhill. The company is profitable, and uses cash to open new locations. These locations quickly pay for themselves, and the cash-flow snowball grows.', 'The good news for investors right now is that Five Below stock is down about 16% year to date, giving investors a better entry point for a long-term investment.', ""Whereas business is humming for Walmart, Ollie's, and Five Below, Dollar General has some problems. On one hand, its revenue is at an all-time high, powered both by new locations and same-store sales growth at existing stores. However, its diluted earnings per share (EPS) fell in 2023, and they're expected to fall again in 2024."", 'The silver lining is that Dollar General is still seeing plenty of consumer demand, and it is still profitable. Therefore, this business is salvageable. Management just needs to identify the problems that are keeping its profits down and fix them.', ""In reality, Dollar General already knows that the key problem is sub-optimal inventory management, and it's working to correct it. Based on management's guidance, the turnaround won't be complete this year. But I believe it will happen sooner than later, boosting the company's earnings by a surprising amount in the coming years."", ""In the meantime, those who buy Dollar General stock today can be rewarded while they wait. Unlike Ollie's or Five Below, Dollar General stock pays a dividend. The yield is higher than Walmart's -- another reason to prefer Dollar General. And on top of that, Dollar General stock will likely increase its payout again in 2024, just as it has done for eight straight years."", ""In summary, I understand why investors love Walmart stock, but it's not necessarily a good value right now. Therefore, for investors who love the discount retail space, Ollie's, Five Below, and Dollar General offer better opportunities for earnings growth. I'd buy shares of all three today before buying shares of Walmart."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Five Below right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Five Below, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Five Below wasn’t one of them.

Unfortunately, these improvements may not make its stock a buy today. Here's why."", ""Despite the stock's past struggles, Walmart has finally learned to leverage e-commerce to its advantage. It acquired Flipkart in 2018, a major e-retailer in India, giving it some degree of success internationally. This is critical, as many of its attempts to compete internationally as a brick-and-mortar retailer ended with embarrassing failures."", ""Walmart's move into e-commerce domestically seems to have succeeded. As a result, e-commerce has become the fastest-growing part of its business. Moreover, e-commerce plays a role in turning its market saturation in the U.S. to its advantage. About 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart, leaving little room for additional in-store sales growth. However, this proximity to customers helped Walmart to build a competitive advantage through omnichannel retailing, allowing it to combine in-store and e-retailing to offer a superior customer experience."", 'Additionally, entering the e-commerce business allowed it to copy Amazon with respect to digital advertising and a similar subscription service, Walmart+.

This amounts to a dividend yield of 1.4%, a level close to the S&P 500.', 'Nonetheless, the S&P 500 gives investors the diversification that comes from holding about 500 stocks. Although Walmart is a stable business offering market-matching returns, buying its stock leaves shareholders dependent on one management team participating in just a few industries. Thus, it brings higher risks for comparable returns, leaving new buyers less incentive to choose it over the S&P 500.', 'Admittedly, some current shareholders may fare better, particularly long-term investors and those who bought when the stock had struggled. A $1,000 investment in its August 1972 debut on the New York Stock Exchange would leave an investor with around $2.6 million today, a massive return an index would struggle to surpass.', 'Also, even those who have not held it that long have benefited from its dividend growth.

Hence, if one earns a double-digit (or higher) dividend yield from their original investment in the Dividend King, it makes sense to stay in the stock.', 'Ultimately, Walmart looks like a solid stock to hold. Steady increases and rising dividend yields have brought significant returns, especially if one has held the stock for decades.', 'However, its current dividend yield and total returns match the S&P 500.

We have also discussed the global unemployment rates. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in the World.\xa0', 'The International Labour Organization (ILO) has reported that global unemployment rates are anticipated to rise in 2024, despite a slight improvement in the previous year. The 2023 unemployment rate saw a modest decrease to 5.1 percent from 5.3 percent in 2022. However, the outlook for 2024 suggests an additional two million job seekers, pushing the global unemployment rate to 5.2 percent. This rise is concerning, particularly amid growing social inequalities and stagnant productivity.', 'Notably, there are significant variations between higher and lower income countries. In 2023, the jobs gap rate in high-income nations was 8.2 percent, contrasting with 20.5 percent in low-income countries. Similarly, while the unemployment rate in high-income countries remained at 4.5 percent, it was 5.7 percent in low-income nations. These disparities underscore the challenges faced by different economic strata in accessing decent work opportunities.', 'Moreover, despite some improvements since 2020, working poverty persists, with both extreme and moderate poverty levels increasing in 2023. Income inequality has widened, which could impede economic recovery efforts. The report highlights the urgency of addressing structural imbalances in the labour market to ensure sustained recovery and promote social justice, emphasizing the need for swift and effective action to mitigate these challenges.', 'In the World Economic Outlook Update for January 2024, global growth is forecasted to remain stable at 3.1 percent throughout the year, with a slight uptick to 3.2 percent expected in 2025. The report attributes this steady growth to efforts by central banks to combat inflation through heightened interest rates and the scaling back of fiscal support, particularly in the face of mounting debt burdens. Notably, inflationary pressures are easing more rapidly than anticipated across most regions, driven by the resolution of supply-chain disruptions and the implementation of tighter monetary policies.', 'Projections suggest a decline in global headline inflation to 5.8 percent for 2024, followed by a further decrease to 4.4 percent in 2025. However, it is noted that the forecast for 2025 has been revised downwards, indicating a more optimistic outlook for inflationary trends in the near future. Despite these positive developments, challenges persist, particularly regarding the impact of restrictive monetary policies and reduced government spending on overall economic activity.', 'Before getting into our list of countries with the highest average salaries in the world in 2024, let’s look at some companies that have recently increased salaries for their employees.', ""Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) has recently revealed salary increases for its managers. Effective from February 1st, the base pay for Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) store managers has increased from $117,000 to $128,000 annually. Additionally, depending on the profitability of the store, annual bonuses could skyrocket to up to 200% of a store manager's salary.\xa0"", 'Moreover, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) is not just focusing on managerial roles but is also investing in its hourly workers. The hourly wage is set to increase to over $18, demonstrating the Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)’s dedication to supporting its employees at all levels. These wage increases, coupled with other recent initiatives like sensory-friendly store hours and expansion of drone delivery services, showcase Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)’s multifaceted approach to enhancing both the employee and customer experience.\xa0', 'On the other hand, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced major pay increases for its factory workers effective January 8, with hourly wages ranging from $22 to $39, according to leaked internal documents. The company has structured its pay tiers based on three regions, reflecting varying costs of living. Workers in California, including those in Fremont and Palo Alto, receive the highest pay, while those in Austin, Texas, and Sparks, Nevada, receive the lowest. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s pay structure also includes performance-based incentives, with employees eligible for bonuses every six months, determined by individual and company performance. Additionally, workers can move between pay levels every six months based on performance evaluations. It is worth highlighting that the US is one of the top 10 countries with the highest average salaries in the world.', ""Compared to the average auto worker's hourly wage of $28, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s pay rates represent a competitive offer. However, the company is not alone in increasing wages; other automakers like Toyota and Hyundai have also boosted pay at their US factories, influenced in part by the United Auto Workers' contract negotiations. Despite these improvements, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) faces ongoing unionization efforts, with employees at its Fremont Factory reportedly forming a UAW organizing committee."", 'Copyright: sifotography / 123RF Stock Photo', 'To list the countries with the highest average salaries in the world, we relied on our database of the highest average salary countries for different professions ranging from engineers to doctors to caregivers to bankers and even designers.

Additionally, Israel places a high emphasis on education, producing a skilled workforce capable of contributing to these industries. Both of these factors explain the high salaries in the country.\xa0', 'Average Salary: $43,920', 'Italy is one of the countries with the highest monthly average salaries in the world. Apart from paying high salaries, Italian work culture highly prioritizes achieving a healthy work-life balance, often seen through the acceptance of extended vacations and the allowance for personal time off.\xa0', 'Average Salary: $44,323', ""The UK's job market offers a spectrum of earning potentials. Median full-time weekly pay in April 2023 was £682, a 5.8% rise from the previous year, while part-time workers earned £241 weekly, up by 5.5%. High-paying roles are often in managerial and professional sectors, particularly in IT, communications, finance, and insurance. The median gross annual earnings for full-time employees hit £34,963 in April 2023, marking a 5.8% increase from 2022. Despite wage inflation at 5.6%, outpacing the 3.4% inflation rate, disparities persist with men more likely to earn higher wages than women.\xa0"", 'Average Salary: $45,000', ""Japan's largest companies have agreed to a substantial 5.28% wage increase for 2024 which is the highest hike in 33 years, as reported by the country's main union. This decision speaks volumes about an impending shift in the Bank of Japan's long-standing stimulus efforts.\xa0"", 'Average Salary: $45,348', 'In 2024, Belgian employers are planning a 4.9% increase in salary budgets, aiming to address high inflation and labor market challenges. This increase, while lower than the 11.3% seen in 2023, reflects efforts to remain competitive. Factors driving this include inflationary pressure (71%) and the need to respond to a tighter labor market (49%).\xa0', 'Average Salary: $45,870', ""ADP's research forecasts increased take-home salaries in the Netherlands for 2024, primarily due to enhanced tax credits. Individuals earning a gross monthly salary of 3,400 euros ($3795) could see approximately 80 euros ($86.74) more in their bank accounts monthly, attributed to elevated income-related tax reductions. Notably, those on minimum wage with full-time positions may experience the most significant boost, potentially up to 267 euros ($290) extra monthly.\xa0"", 'Average Salary: $46,020', ""The Swedish authorities have raised the minimum monthly salary requirement for work permits to SEK 27,360 ($2590) without provisional regulations. This increase is based on the current year's median wage, aims to impact 10-20% of work permit applicants, particularly in service, health care, sales, and forestry sectors.\xa0"", 'Average Salary: $46,379', 'According to Statistics Austria, the gross monthly salary for Master’s graduates in full-time positions has risen from €3,100 ($3360) to €3,300 ($3577) between the academic years of 2008/09 and 2020/21. Conversely, Bachelor’s degree holders have also experienced an increase in earnings, with the median income climbing from €2,653 ($2878) to €2,986 ($3236) per month over the same period.\xa0', 'Average Salary: $46,951', 'In Hong Kong, 78% of employees anticipate a salary increase in 2024, with 35% hoping for a 3-5% raise.

Despite only 68% receiving raises in 2023, mostly between 3-5%, optimism prevails.\xa0', 'Average Salary: $47,703', 'According to the Trade Me jobs report, the national average salary increased by 8% from the previous year. Notably, 15 industries hit record average salaries, with regions like Wellington, Southland, and Otago witnessing between 9 to 10% increases. The healthcare sector experienced the most substantial annual wage growth at 10 percent, reaching $70,649, while trades and services, manufacturing and operations, education, and hospitality and tourism all saw major upticks ranging from 8 to 9%.\xa0', 'Average Salary: $48,607', 'Temporary immigration pathways have exerted downward pressure on wage growth in Canada, particularly in low-pay sectors such as accommodation and agriculture. Statistics Canada reports that the majority of temporary foreign workers are employed in these industries, which are characterized by lower wages compared to other sectors. With over one million unfilled jobs in May 2022, which decreased to 637,365 by November 2023, the influx of temporary workers has filled vacancies but likely impacted the wages of established Canadians.', 'Average Salary: $48,887', ""Ireland's emphasis on education produces a highly skilled workforce, attracting global talent.

Motley Fool money starts now."", ""It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Dylan Lewis, joining me in the studio. Motley Fool Senior Analysts, Matt Argersinger, and Andy Cross. Gentlemen, great to have you both here."", 'Matt Argersinger: Hey, Dylan.', 'Andy Cross: Hey, Dylan.', ""Dylan Lewis: We've got a run-down on retail, the state of things at Paramount and of course, stocks on our radar. But we're kicking off with real estate news, Matt, after several years and lawsuits related to excessive fees and antitrust activity, we might be looking at a new real estate market."", ""Matt Argersinger: We might be, Dylan, if you ever sold a home. It's always been confounding well, at least for me, that in addition to paying a commission to your agent, in that case, the seller's agent or the listing agent, you'd also have to pay a 2.5, 3% commission to the buyer's agent. And this was essentially, for decades, a mandate of the National Association of Realtors, NAR, of which the vast majority of agents in the US are members of. It's why commissions on transacting home haven't traditionally been set in this 5-6% range, split evenly, usually by the seller's agent and the buyer's agent."", ""So instantaneously on every transaction, in addition to other closing costs, repair expenses, 5-6% of your homes' equity would instantly, that had been built up maybe for over many years, and worth tens of thousands of dollars would instantly go away for these commissions. It always seemed like one of the final areas of the market that had yet to be disrupted. Because if you think about what's happened to travel agents, what's happened to brokerage commissions, certainly transacting and almost everything in the country has gotten cheaper overtime except transacting a house."", ""If you look at the median price of a home in the US, right around $400,000, that's 20,000 or more in commissions just to sell a house. But here we are. The NAR has essentially settled, which means they are not contesting any more of these lawsuits, the civil action suits against them, they're paying a fee and the idea is that they're going to lose their monopoly position on the marketplace. Now, agents won't be required to be members of the NAR."", ""They won't be forced, for example, to subscribe to MLS listings already get paid and essentially makes real estate agents, free agents that can set their own commissions. And if you're a home seller, or a homebuyer, gives you far more negotiating power. You can pay a commission to a buyer that you want to pay, and it's no longer causing a mandate to pay a commission to the other side of the transaction."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, and looking at this news, I was trying to process both the news itself and then the follow-on impact that it would have. And I feel like for buyers and sellers, we're probably looking at lower fees and a little bit more flexibility. Beyond that in the business landscape of real estate, I feel like it's really hard to nail down what it means for companies like Zillow, Redfin, and other operators."", ""Matt Argersinger: I think clearly for the publicly traded agencies, this is not going to be great news. I mean, those fees are coming down, their margins have to come down. The business is going to change. There's going to be less agents in the marketplace. For companies like Redfin and Zillow, it is a little cloudy for me, because for one, Redfin who has already trying to disrupt the whole transaction fee of this marketplace anyway and with Zillow, Zillow really depends on the vast majority of its revenue still comes from agents who pays a low for leads on their marketplace."", ""They need agents, and they depend on the traditional model. So for Zillow, it's also could be disruptive, although a little confusing. I would just say this, good real estate agents do deserve to get paid. I don't want to make it seem like these commissions were being paid out the door for nothing. I mean, many work really hard. I've worked with agents that had been great. They spent a lot of time working with buyers or sellers, and they deal with a lot of paperwork. There's a lot of value to what they do. So I feel like it's still, in a way, it makes the marketplace better for them because I think good agents will thrive. Good agents will still get paid. A lot of agents who were just living off these richly undeserved agent commissions will not thrive."", ""Dylan Lewis: This week we've also got updates in AI sending tech companies in two different directions. We're going to kick off looking at Adobe here, Andy. Company reported earlier this week, results were good, but it seems like the guidance and the general outlook on how AI might be affecting the business has the market concerned."", ""Andy Cross: Yeah. Dylan, it's like that Damocles hanging over Adobe. AI is just waiting for that string to catch, to end up doing some serious damage to this company. This is a company that's been in investing in AI for a long time. Their Firefly solution, since its launch, now has more than 6.5 billion images created. They're investing in this space, and they talk a lot about this. However, even though that quarter was really quite good, revenues up 11%, adjusted earnings per share up 18%. They didn't have to pay a billion-dollar fee for the Figma transaction getting canceled. Their digital media revenue was up 12%."", ""Their ending annual recurring revenue, which is very important when you think about this business, up 14%. The Document Cloud business, which is part of their solutions and part of this package, was up 23%. So that's really impressive. Their digital experience revenue, that's their new marketing business they've been growing. That was up 10% with remaining performance obligations up 16%. So the quarter was all really positive, very good. However, it was all in the conversation about the guide in their future revenues, thinking about the bookings and how artificial intelligence is or is not impacting their business."", ""Especially it's things like OpenAI Sora, which is their text to video creating device and how much that's impacting, not just creating videos and imaging, but also giving clients the ability to edit those. Lots of conversations around what that means for their business. They didn't come out very enthusiastic about the guide going forward. Lots of conversations around with the analysts about what this means after minutia at the timings at this quarter, next quarter, a lot of concerns that so much of the growth of the year is going to be back-ended into the second half."", ""Clearly you see the stock reacting, more down 13% as we're going into tape this. The market clearly having some discussions and some hesitations about Adobe, which is the leader in this space. By the way, the stock has done very well over the last year. So I think the most pullback maybe a little ahead of itself and this is some of the pullback we're seeing."", ""Dylan Lewis: A different story with AI over at Oracle. This is a company that is catching the tailwinds of AI. Matt shares up 10% this week following the company's fiscal Q3 report. Thanks in large part to demand for the company's Cloud offerings."", ""Matt Argersinger: Absolutely. I mean, if you look at the headlines, revenue up 7%, adjusted EPS up 16%, both better-than-expected, but the two likely reasons, and you hit one of them, the stock has been up so much. First Oracle's remaining performance obligation, RPO, Andy mentioned this for Adobe as well. This is basically sales that Oracle is contractually obligated to fulfill, but hasn't yet quite recognize as revenue or if you're a simple investor like me, it's called backlog."", ""That's up to 80 billion, up 29% year over year. So that's just revenue growth is going to continue to be fairly robust going forward for Oracle. But the Cloud revenue for Oracle, 25% year over year, Cloud infrastructure business, 49% increase year over year. That's the piece that really competes with the bigger at Cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft's Azure."", ""You can conclude right there that Oracle is gaining market share. The big reason for that is a CEOs Safra Catz, demand for Oracle's Artificial Intelligence Cloud capabilities far exceeding supply. To address this, Oracle actually signed a new agreement with Nvidia in the quarter, investing heavily in opening and expanding its data center network. The AI plug in here for Oracle is very real and very robust, and it's got investors really excited about the business, obviously."", 'Dylan Lewis: Matt, right there, you name checked a lot of the big companies and brands that we associate with cloud discussion, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon. We have generally left Oracle out of the conversation for the big Cloud players, do you feel like we need to start bringing them into that group?', ""Matt Argersinger: I think so. This might eventually become a big four with Oracle. Because if you think on Oracle, all the other three companies that you mentioned all have big leads, big market shares, but they're also doing very different things in a lot of different markets. Amazon in particular, Alphabet of course, with advertising and YouTube. This is Oracle's business. I mean, database networking Cloud infrastructure is their business. It's their focus. I think they're going to continue to gain market share."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break over at Under Armour, it's meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis joined in studio with Matt Argersinger and Andy Cross. We've got a rundown on retail and apparel. We're going to start things off with Williams-Sonoma, a huge week for them, Andy, shares up 18% following the company's earnings release. Even though net income declined year over year and revenue was basically flat. Andy, what's going on here?"", ""Andy Cross: Well, on the earnings per share, because they buy back so much stock, it was actually up a little bit just 3%, but far ahead of analysts' estimates and the sales were down 7%. Again ahead of estimates was much better than how management had guided. Laura Alber has been leading Williams-Sonoma for so many years, so successfully years. I think very conservative when she thinks about running this company, she and her team. Been talking about the challenging market."", ""We're having comp sales down. Almost 7%, that was better than two years ago but worse than a year ago. The four-year company, you go back four years, Williams-Sonoma Lakes have focused on that pre-pandemic. They were up almost 30%. I mentioned the earnings per share, gross margins is where they won Dylan in this quarter. Higher merchandise margins, lower supply costs. Williams-Sonoma has been really effective at managing their supply costs."", ""Being very efficient as how they have taken out more and more costs from their supply chain, how the pricing is starting to impact that. They've been talking about that for the past year, which is one reason why their stock has done so well. That allows them to get more efficient when it comes at gross margin up at 46% versus 41% a year ago. The inventories were down 14%. Again, they're just managing this business, blocking and tackling very well."", ""Operating cash flow was up 60% for the year. But because they've been so efficient on their capital expenditure, free cash flow more than doubled, that allowed them to announce a 26% increase in the dividend certainly helps with the stock price performing so well. Even though comps really for the year where basically down across the board and for the quarter."", ""Dylan Lewis: Andy, this is probably not accompanying that a lot of people necessarily have on their radar and it is to their detriment. Shares up 140% over the last 12 months. It's been an incredible performer. The stock is currently at all-time highs for people that maybe haven't been following this business. Do you feel like the valuation is in a good spot or do you think it's getting a little rich?"", ""Andy Cross: Here's just some context behind that. I'm a fan of Williams-Sonoma and a shareholder and we've recommended the stock in lots of different spots here at The Motley Fool. The market cap is more than 18 billion. It sells at around an earnings multiple of around 20 times. Historically their earnings multiple is more in the low double-digits or call it the 12, 13, 15 times range. When it got so cheap, it got down to single digits, which is one reason why the stock has done so well. If you want to nibble, fine, don't go all rushing, but put it on your watchlist. Certainly, if you don't have it as one to keep an eye on."", 'Dylan Lewis: We have a less glamorous story going on over at Under Armour. News out this week that founder Kevin Plank will be stepping back into the CEO role and Matt, the market did not seem too excited about it.', ""Matt Argersinger: Not at all, Dylan. The stock sold off pretty hard. I think there's a few reasons for this, which we'll get into. One, it's interesting, the current or now former CEO, Stephanie Linnartz, she's only on the job for about a year and she was in the first year of what she thought was going to be a three-year turnaround for the business. Clearly, that turnaround is not happening to the satisfaction of the board and probably to a lot of investors."", ""But I just found that press release from Under Armour very short, very vague. I felt like this needed a letter from Kevin Plank saying why he's coming back, why he thinks it's important for him to step back into the CEO role. We didn't get that. We just got a pretty short press release. That's interesting. If you look at Under Armour stock, it's been stuck in the low single-digits for what seems like forever. Maybe there's a little bit of desperation here, but you have to remember how Plank left the CEO spot in 2019. Putting aside his various personal scandals, he didn't leave the company in exactly a great state."", ""Revenue growth had already flatlined for a few years, he made several poor acquisitions to try to digitize the brand. Inventory hadn't been managed well. They failed to gain traction at leisure market which I feel they basically invented it. Yet they see that to Lululemon and Nike and others. This isn't Steve Jobs coming back to the doors. This is not Howard Schultz coming in or Michael Dell coming back. A founder that's going to come back and lead the company to glory. I think that's why the market is taking a very cautious look here and saying this is a CEO with a pretty tumultuous tenure at the end. Coming back can a turnaround really happen now?"", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, I have not sold very many stocks that I've owned and when I have almost without exception, it has been the wrong decision. The exception to that is Under Armour. [laughs] I sold my shares, I think when it was in the mid-teens and this business has not managed to get back on track. It's down about 50% from then. Recently, shares are at their lowest level in almost a decade. What is the return to normal even look like for this business?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I don't know, Dylan. Unfortunately, I'm still a shareholder, and Under Armour withheld throughout. You see the stocks at a 10-year low. I looked at it. It's about a 17-year low in the stock price. But this is a situation where I step back and say, wait a second, how much worse can this actually get? Because if you look at Under Armour's stock, it's trading for about 0.6 times revenue. For comparison, Nike trades at three times revenue."", ""The stock's at a 17-year low. This is the kind that still generates healthy cash from operations. We were talking about before the show, that the brand has to have some equity value. That's probably greater or somewhere in the vicinity of three billion, which is its market cap. Maybe it can't get worse and just maybe Kevin Plank finds a little bit of that entrepreneurial magic he had early on in Under Armour. Three years from now, four years from now we're looking at Under Armour and it's $25 stock."", 'Andy Cross: Six dangerous words in an estimate. How much lower can this go? Just be mindful of that.', ""Dylan Lewis: You're pumping the brakes there a little bit there Andy."", 'Andy Cross: Be cautious there.', ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to wrap the company updates with a look at Ulta Andy, shares the cosmetic company down 5% after earnings. What's the story here?"", ""Andy Cross: It's interesting, the quarter was actually pretty good. It wasn't anything to really crow about. Revenues were up almost 10%. Earnings at $8.08 ahead of estimates so that was actually quite strong. Their comp sales were at 2.5% but that was versus 16% a year ago so a pretty good deceleration and a little bit lower than the estimates, which I think is what has the stock lower."", ""Transactions up 4.5% but pricing or average cost of the goods that someone buys down almost 2%. The gross margin was up a little bit. Lower shipping, better supply chain costs. Same thing was we sold Williams-Sonoma. I don't think quite as effective at Ulta, but a little bit better, but lower on the merchandise margin, which was different than what we saw at Williams-Sonoma. Sales gross and operating margin the cost down at 23.1% versus 23.6%."", ""They're doing a pretty good job of managing the cost that boosted the operating margin to 14.5% versus 13.9%. A lot of numbers there, but ultimately, they've done a pretty good job managing the cost in a relatively slower-growth business. Skincare up very much. One interesting little tidbit there. They talked about the sales for the makeup category decreased in low-single-digit range. They saw softness in prestige cosmetics was partially offset by growth in mass makeup. They pointed at Elf Beauty as one of the ones that are doing pretty well at Ulta."", ""Dylan Lewis: It's interesting. I haven't taken a look at the quarter, but I'm wondering if they said anything about shrink or anything like that, Andy. I don't know if you guys caught it, I only caught a little bit of it, but CNBC did this pretty large report this past week about retail theft. I can't remember the exact story, but I guess there was a ring of resellers who had stolen millions of dollars and Ulta is one of the big victims here of just ceiling this high-margin makeup, reselling it, pocketing the difference and I know they made some arrest. But it was a remarkable story."", ""Matt Argersinger: It was a huge enterprise, actually a criminal enterprise. Now I think this quarter didn't get nearly the tension as we've seen in the past. I think you'll see that they're starting to peak a little bit in there talking about shrink I think but it still continues to be an issue. The guidance, by the way, just very quickly is that comp sales at 4-5% versus 5.7%. That's for the full year guided ahead. Comp sales for this year ahead, not quite as good as last year."", ""Dylan Lewis: I'm glad you brought up the shrink story there, Matt because I remember looking at Target's results earlier this earnings season and I think it was two quarters ago, shrink was the narrative. They made that statement, I think it was a $500 million adjustment. Some of the numbers that they were looking out for the year saying that shrink was the culprit."", ""We didn't see a lot of headlines on that. We didn't see a lot of discussion of that with the most recent earnings release but we've actually dig into management's calls. It came up 12 times. It is still a story for some of these retailers and we're still hearing management talk about it but it seems like one of those things that has crested as a wave already when it comes to financials."", ""Matt Argersinger: When CNBC does a special report or in a special documentary and something that usually as Andy alluded to, it's looked at the peak but it might be one of those situations where hopefully companies are figuring it out and moving on."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt Argersinger, Andy Cross, fellows, we're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next, we dig into the turmoil at Paramount and the possible path forward for the entertainment giant. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Award season is over, but there's still plenty of drama unfolding in Hollywood. Motley Fool Money is Ricky Mulvey caught up with Bloomberg entertainment reporter Lucas Shaw for a look at the business of streaming, the power of incentives and corporate infighting at Paramount."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It's a tough time to be a movie company, but do you think there's starting to be a greater willingness to go for those singles and doubles now that there's some adult dramas that are doing poorly. Ferrari did not make money. But Anyone but You, which was a romantic comedy made more than 200 million at the box office. Like A24 eked out a profit with Iron Claw. So is that door continuing to open a little bit for those adult dramas that used to just go to streaming."", ""Lucas Shaw: I get very mixed signals on this and I think it's hard to answer that holistically. I don't think that these companies are giving up the Tentpole strategy, which is, let's have a handful of really expensive, really big movies. Because when those hit, they make so much money that it pays for everything else. They can't really move away from that for that reason. But you do see certain studios. I think Universal, Sony, and Warner Brothers, foremost among them making a wide range of movies, believing that there is value in having to use your metaphor, a single or a double, in addition to the home run."", ""If you look at the types of programming that Netflix is going to do, I think they are going to take fewer really big swings and make more movies. That cost in the 20-$100 million range, which is, I don't know that it's going to be a bunch of dramas. I think it's going to be comedy, and thriller, and action, and things like that. But I do think you'll see a good number of movies made that are in that middle that the big studios had really forsaken over the last several years."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, and I want to own a move to Paramount, which you covered in a story called How Paramount Became A Cautionary Tale Of The Streaming Wars. The only thing on their upcoming slate seems to be those big Tentpole films after the Bob Marley movie, and they did Mean Girls. But then upcoming it seems that it's a Transformers movie, they're going to do a PAW patrol movie and it's not these small movies. They might have trouble attracting creators right now to get those smaller to midsize movies for their studio."", ""Lucas Shaw: The problems at Paramount have made it very hard for that studio to do deals. I've spoken with executives there who've been very pleasantly surprised, I should say, at some of the talent who've reupped their relationships with the studio, including John Krasinski though, filmmaker of A Quiet Place. But you talked to a lot of producers and they're pretty clear that Paramount would be their last choice, both because it's a company that just hasn't made that many movies."", ""Other than basically Top Gun, hasn't delivered a lot of huge hits. But I think more than anything because of the uncertainty at the corporate level where you have a controlling shareholder in Shari Redstone who pretty clearly would like to sell the business, is looking for buyers, is struggling to find buyers. She's looking to exit, not because this is a great time to sell and you can get a great deal, but because the business has been declining and she wants to get out while she still can."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Can you take us into the informal auction going on for for Paramount right now. Where's that sit?"", ""Lucas Shaw: Actually, you know what? Let's let's take it back a step. I think Shari decided that she wanted to sell at some point last year. Some people say over the summer, some people say in the fall. Either way, she had been approached over the years by a few parties. She really started late last year talking to David Ellison, who runs a company called Skydance, whose father is Larry Ellison, one of the richest men in the world. David Ellison's company is a co-financier and producer of Top Gun, of the Mission Impossible movies, of Star Trek movies, all Paramount biggest franchises."", ""David Ellison would like to buy Shari Redstone out of National Amusements, which is the family holding company, a movie theater chain that has the stake in Paramount and then merge his company with Paramount. The challenge with this is that while that deal is great for Shari Redstone, it's not necessarily great for Paramount. I think there's some people who are skeptical about why you would want to merge with Skydance other than because David Ellison wants them to and there would certainly be a dispute over valuation."", ""So you've got Shari Redstone and her camp looking to see if there are other bidders. Because anytime you're trying to sell, you want to have multiple bidders so you can drive up the price. So she's talked to David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Brothers discovery. She's talked to Apollo, the private equity firm, and she's talked to some other potential buyers. At the same time, you've got the company of Paramount with advisors looking to see if there are other offers because they don't necessarily love this David Ellison idea."", ""That's the state of play. We know that David Ellison is interested and has at least made a preliminary offer. We know there have been conversations with a couple of other parties, but it's not clear that there is another tangible offer or real buyer on the table right now for the company. So it's an open question as to whether they're going to get a deal done."", 'Ricky Mulvey: In the past, Netflix was a part of the conversation. Warner Brothers discovery looked at it briefly.', ""Lucas Shaw: It should be noted. I should just on that point, that yes, Netflix has been part of the conversation, but Netflix was part of the conversation in so much as it wanted to buy just the studio, Paramount Pictures. I think there are a lot of entities that would be happy to buy just the studio because it's got a good library that they could exploit and film and television, it's got, honestly great real estate that lot in Hollywood alone is worth billions of dollars."", ""The problem is that if you're Shari Redstone and you don't want to sell just the studio because it's your most valuable asset. So then you're left with a bunch of stuff nobody wants. If you're a buyer, it's the stuff nobody wants. Like you don't necessarily want to take these declining cable networks. So it's going to be interesting to see Shari Redstone's probably going to have to sell at a discount to unload the stuff that nobody wants in order to unload the whole company."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It seems that there has been a little bit of pride when they've had offers on the table. BET was one of them where the deal is off by a billion dollars, so everybody walks away. Now Paramount may get to a point where there's no option other than the buyer that's willing to take on the company."", ""Lucas Shaw: Yeah. I mean, it's crazy that they almost sold. They could have sold BET, they could've sold Showtime. That would have raised enough money between the two of them. If they did the deals, they probably could've gotten 4.5-5 billion dollars, that would solved a lot of problems. They could have paid off a lot of debt. They could have funded a bunch of stuff for the streaming service and yeah, they just didn't want to do it."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Is the cardinal misstep that Paramount made with streaming, which is their main loser of money. Just that they were late to the party or were there other mistakes along the way?', ""Lucas Shaw: They were definitely late. But that was not the cardinal sin because every company was late and every company that went in is facing the same conundrum right now, whether it's Paramount, or Warner Brothers Discovery, or Disney, or in a lesser way, Comcast because there are more diversified enterprise. But entities that have a bunch of cable networks are just watching as they fall into the sea and their streaming service is not rising fast enough."", ""So should they have moved faster? Yes, Disney moved a little bit faster. Having a lot of the same problems. I think the issue is that this was always going to be painful and you have this incredibly lucrative business that was going away and entities that made a lot of money from that business were not going to rush to kill it. It's the the classic innovator's dilemma that people talk about. Netflix was able to come in as a new player and disrupt this business and none of the competition moved fast or move quickly enough to respond."", 'I do think that Paramount has made some specific missteps. I mean, you look at it and I should also say Paramount was hamstrung by the corporate infighting. There were two separate entities, CBS and Viacom, that the Redstones controlled. Shari Redstone had to spend many years fighting to cement family control over them in disputes with management of both companies, when she did actually put it together. That then took a while to make it happen. So there were a lot of hurdles to making it work. Then they spent a lot of money really quickly.', ""They didn't think about it. All these companies made the same mistake. They had to try to compress 15 years of Netflix's building into a short time frame and we can debate, is there any way in which that would have gone well? Or was it just a function of going late and I'm not sure the answer. I'm sure that there were sounder strategies with these companies. I also think that had they acted five-years earlier, there's no guarantee it would have worked."", ""Ricky Mulvey: On Paramount, Shari Redstone wants a buyer. What happens if Paramount doesn't find a buyer?"", ""Lucas Shaw: It's a good question. It's the one facing all of these enterprises. Then Shari faces a couple of options. She can stay the course and believe that we've suffered maximum pain right now and the streaming service is going to keep growing, or we're going to manage costs and we'll figure it out. I don't think Wall Street would be very happy to hear that because it isn't working right now. There's a strategy where they resort to selling individual pieces again or where they halt costs a bit more. Then there's a more dramatic one which some have proposed which I still don't see them doing."", ""But this notion of them becoming a pure arms dealer, which means that they shut down the streaming service and just be a studio and sell the others. But considering that that company makes basically all of its money from cable networks and to some extent from streaming. That's where most of the employees are. That would require, I should say, gutting the business. You'd fire 50-80% of the staff, which is why I see that is unlikely but she'll have to have to make some big changes if she cuts it because if they come out and say, they haven't officially said that they're for sale but if there was a bunch of coverage basically saying that the deal talks were over, their stocks is going to tank."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I think there's also an interesting angle on this with the power of incentives. I want to talk about David Zaslav in a sec, but in this case, there's an early misstep from the CEO, Philipe Dauman, this guy was making so much money in stock awards. He incentivized to boost the stock price and then in order to do so, he's buying back stock, which means they're not investing into content and growing the business for the long term."", ""Lucas Shaw: Philipe Dauman, really one of the worst media CEOs of the last 20-plus years, I would say. Maybe, ever. He took what was one of the most vibrant and great businesses, in Viacom, drove it into the ground. He didn't understand Netflix, he didn't understand YouTube and rather than invest a bunch of money in streaming, which he should've done because they had the networks that were most exposed. MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, they speak to young people so you could see the trends early. I"", 'nstead of investing in streaming, he just bought back a bunch of stock. He did whatever he could to prop up the share price and it was really destructive to the enterprise long term. All the mistakes that Shari Redstone and Bob Bakish may or may not have made Philipe made more. Sumner Redstone, who was in charge of the company at the time and was the was the owner, they deserve the largest share of the blame, no question.', ""Ricky Mulvey: I wonder if there's an incentive problem right now. If Warner Brothers discovery and you've talked about it on the town, where David Zaslav has compensation award tied to the free cash flow of the business. I was talking to one of our investment analysts, Tim Buyers earlier. Basically, that's an uncommon way to incentivize a CEO. Feel free to break down this theory but now you have HBO or the company that's essentially shelved movies, one of which recently was the Wiley Coyote vs Acme movie. You get a tax loss on that, which is going to boost. You get the immediate boost of free cash flow but then, you might be killing ideas, drawing away creators."", ""Lucas Shaw: It's a question of whether he's incentivized to just cut cost to make cash flow look good and get himself paid more rather than act in the best interest of the company. It's a tough press. I don't think that David Zaslav made free cash and the Board made free cash flow the most important metric for his pay just because they knew that they were going to cut costs. I think they wanted to set the target. We have all this debt and we need to save money to pay it off. How are we going to incentivize people to do that? We're going to incentivize them to generate free cash flow and that's what they did."", ""That being said, it's just a terrible look for this guy who's about to get paid a ton of money, even though their stock is in the toilet, nobody thinks the company is performing very well. By the way, that free cash flow being the metric for performance and how people are paid, that doesn't apply to most of the employees of that company. It mostly applies to David Zaslav and maybe the inner circle. They're really perverse incentives there."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Listeners, you can catch Lucas Shaw on X. He is @Lucas_Shaw. Coming up after the break, Andy Cross and Matt Argersinger return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Dylan Lewis: As always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis joined again by Matt Argersinger and Andy Cross. If you went all in on the Stanley tumbler craze, you're going to have to make room in your cupboard for another weird household item that has caught fire. Andy, grocer Trader Joe's began selling mini tote bags for $3 in March. They are now selling for hundreds of dollars online. What are you make of this new consumer craze?"", ""Andy Cross: How many is many on the per square inch of tote bags? This has got to be a record if they're really small. We just bought a Stanley for $35 at REI and those things are some serious piece of hardware. We're now part of the Stanley craze, I think we have two of them now at the house so I can understand that. If it's me, when I go to Trader Joe's, I buy a lot of stuff. I'm bringing tote bags, hanging them on my shoulder, pulling them out of my jackets. Minis are not helping me very much."", 'Dylan Lewis: I think you timed the market well on that. I think you got in on the tumblers slightly after the peak and maybe have a good cost basis there. Matt, what do you make of these consumer phrases?', ""Matt Argersinger: I can't speak to this. I'm a guy who takes brown bags run reused bags to the grocery store and reuses them so I have I can't believe people are paying $100 for tote bags. I cannot believe it."", ""Dylan Lewis: I'm just happy people are using reusable bags. That makes me happy."", 'Andy Cross: There you go.', ""Dylan Lewis: I'll take that. Let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question. Matt, you're up first this week, what are you looking at?"", ""Matt Argersinger: Weird special situation here, Equity Commonwealth, the ticker is EQC. Equity Commonwealth, it's a two billion dollar real estate investment trust with 2.2 billion in net cash. Do the math there. Yes, it's trading below the cash on its balance sheet. Now it does own four office buildings that are cash-flowing but materially they're a very small part of the story here. Management is essentially sitting on 2.2 billion in cash collecting 5% with treasuries, which is good but waiting to make a transformative investment for the business."", ""The problem is they've been sitting on their hands for quite a while now. Investors are starting to get a little impatient and now there's a hedge fund called Land and Buildings Investment Management, LLC. That's a mouthful them but they own 3% of EQC shares, and they've submitted a letter demanding that EQC actually liquidate the business because under their model, liquidating the business would actually result in a net asset value of about 20% above where EQC is trading in the public markets. We'll have to see if this gets any traction. But I think it's a fastening situation to watch over the next few months."", ""Dylan Lewis: Dan, a special situation with Equity Commonwealth. What's your question?"", ""Dan Boyd: A special situation is called for, it doesn't make any dang sense. I'm sorry, are you trying to sell us on cash or office buildings, Mattie?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I think cash but it sounds like I'm actually trying to sell Dan a tote bag from Trader Joe's Andy, you're going to be able to beat that? What's on your radar?"", ""Andy Cross: I got Landstar guys, LSTR, an asset-light logistics company that generates more than five billion in sales, market cap value almost seven billion more cash than debt. It's an asset-light business, so it doesn't really own a lot of the assets. It uses technology to help clients, which is more than 25,000 customers across 1,100 independent agents. Basically get our goods from point A to point Z. Mostly inter-modal trucking, van shipments but also some Aaron Freight."", ""They help make sense of all the logistics challenges to be able to get all our stuff from when we buy it to when we want to consume it. Now it's been a tough two years post-pandemic because we're not buying as much stuff. Inventories are going lower. Companies are trying to run down all those inventories. You're just not seeing the volumes come across their net worth. That's been a big hit to their sales and to their profits. But this is a very talented management team. They focus very heavily on returns on capital and free cash flow. Ultimately in a pretty good spot, I think for Landstar."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Landstar.', 'Dan Boyd: First off, absolutely gorgeous stock chart here for the maximum time since they came out in 1993, whatever, just up until the right you love to see it But this is one of those companies where you read about it and you got to read four paragraphs to figure out the day. Make technology or make programming to help people do trucking. Not crazy about this company.', ""Andy Cross: But that's the magic behind Dan. Two tough businesses this week, Dan, which one's going on your watchlist?"", ""Dan Boyd: Well, I'm not going with whatever Mattie said Come on. I don't even know what he was talking about."", ""Dylan Lewis: Landstar wins. Matt, Andy, I appreciate you being here. That's going to do it for us.

Last year, the group unveiled a fiber-shed testing methodology designed to inform product developers about the microplastic and microfiber shed potential of the products they design.', 'Created to help the company reach its goal of making 75 percent of its products with low-shed materials by 2030, the testing method helps quantify the shed rate of specific materials. High-shed fabrications are either redeveloped or discontinued before they enter the market, the group said in 2023.', '“What gets measured gets managed,” Levine said, noting that Under Armour worked with leading textile testing equipment manufacturer James Heal, research and testing firm the Hohenstein Institute, the Nature Conservancy and the Microfibre Consortium to develop the methodology. “This is an example of something that we did to try to get better, and we use it to develop fabrics and materials that shed less,” he added. “If you come home and your home is flooded, you can bail out the water, or you can turn off the tap. This is really an effort to turn off the tap.”', 'Test kits retail for $4,000 to $5,000 through James Heal. “They take up less space, they’re scalable, and we want to evolve it with the help of the industry,” he added. “The ask that we have is, ‘Come use the method.’”', 'Collaboration has also led to the development of a next-generation material that the company believes has the potential to replace traditional stretch technology.', 'Through a partnership with North Carolina State University and chemicals and materials solutions provider Celanese, Under Armour has “come up with a material that provides the stretch in fabrics that Spandex currently provides, but has the ability… to be recyclable,” Levine said. “It gets rid of also some very harmful solvents earlier in the process, and we think that’s a win.”', 'According to the VP, the material, dubbed NeoLast, will make its first appearance over the course of the next year, and a small amount will be made available commercially as well.', '“I want to stress here that we think this has a lot of potential, and it’s an innovation that we’re not keeping as an Under Armour innovation… it’s going to be open to industry use,” he added. “Our hope is that we’ll find ways to use it in increasing concentrations and products, and work with others to bring infrastructure to bear that will scale it.”']"

If you want to skip our overview of the industrial sector, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Best Industrial Machinery Stocks to Invest in. ', 'The industrial machinery industry is one of the most capital intensive in the world. Setting up a firm that makes these machines is not an easy task, and it often requires years of expertise and hefty amounts of capital which until very recently were only available to sizeable nation states such as the United States and the Soviet Union.', 'Over the course of time, these companies, which often trace their roots back to the industrial boom in the U.S. during the second world war, have become private entities. At the same time, the high barriers of entry mean that not only are the top industrial machinery stocks among some of the most advanced companies in the world but also that these firms enjoy the comfort of economies of scale that are hard to compete with.', 'As an example, consider some of the most valuable industrial machinery stocks in terms of market capitalization. A couple of such firms are General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW), and Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN). General Electric, makes and sells some of the most advanced machines in the world. These include jet engines which are the backbone of the U.S. Air Force and nuclear reactors. These reactors are some of the most exacting engineered products on the planet due to the high stress environment in which they operate and the extreme catastrophe that awaits them should even the slightest thing go awry.', 'Similarly, Eaton plays an integral role in the global aviation supply chain. An average jet engine for a commercial airliner can contain as many as fifty thousand individual components, from high precision crystal fan blades to pipes, pumps, and hydraulic motors. All of these have to be kept in prime condition, and they are built to a standard that not many firms can achieve.', 'However, unlike high growth technology stocks, industrial machinery stocks are more down to Earth. Like their technology peers, their performance depends on interest rates since funding pricey manufacturing plants and other equipment requires loans. Similarly, the rosier the economic outlook is, the better industrial machinery stocks fare on the stock market since the demand for their products is assumed to be stable.', 'As an illustration of this aspect of industrial machinery stock performance, consider the shares of General Electric and Eaton. They bled as much as 51% of their share price value on the stock market after the coronavirus lockdowns were put into place, as investor outlook for the global economy darkened.', 'But what about recent stock performance? After all, investor expectations of an easing in interest rates could also generate tailwinds for industrial machinery stocks. 2024 has seen investors start off the year on an optimistic note for rate cuts, but settle with the knowledge that the Fed might take longer than they would like. Year to date, both GE and Eaton are up by 39% and 31%, respectively, with GE enjoying slightly higher returns in the wake of its announcement that it will split into two companies.', ""Analyzing industrial machinery stocks means that investors have to focus on their product portfolio and the potential to both reduce costs (often dubbed as 'improving margins') and gain market share. Both these themes were also present during the latest full hedge fund investor letter cycle which was for the fourth quarter of 2023."", 'For instance, Southeastern Asset Management mentioned General Electric in its investor letter for the period as it outlined:', 'General Electric - Industrial conglomerate General Electric (GE) was the top performer for the year. We exited this multi-year investment as its price went above our appraisal. In 1Q23, GE spun out GE Healthcare, which we sold as it traded at our value. The share price continued its strong performance throughout the spring and summer, and we ultimately sold the position in the third quarter when we no longer saw a margin of safety for the business.

If you want to skip our overview of the US insurance industry and the latest trends and news, then you can take a look at the 5 Largest Insurance Companies in the US by Assets in 2024. ', ""A little known fact about the insurance industry is that it's one of the oldest in the world. The history of insurance dates back to the time of the Code of Hammurabi, one of the first sets of written laws in human history. Since then, the insurance industry has existed in one form or another, and in 2024, the sector has to battle cyber threats and be ready for challenges ushered in by changing global climate trends."", 'As an example, insurance in America has been through quite some trouble over the past couple of years. An insurance company works by collecting money from its customers, and then making payouts in case any of them suffers from an accident or any other untoward life event. The weakness that these companies have to contend with is that they might be unable to make payouts if too many customers qualify for them, and for Florida insurers such as Weston Property & Casualty Insurance Co., the Southern Fidelity Insurance Company, and UPC Insurance, the nightmare scenario materialized in 2022 and 2023 as they went bankrupt. For UPC, the catastrophe came just after the firm announced that it would leave Florida, but the decision came too late and Hurricane Ian caused too much damage for the firm to be able to fund.', 'Since then, at least the property and casualty insurance market in the U.S. is on more stable footing. One report that attempts to cover the state of the US insurance industry comes from the Swiss Re Institute. According to the analysis, personal insurance in America can benefit from lower inflation, as buyer budgets accommodate for more insurance plans. Additionally, the report also adds that the US insurance industry ended up underwriting $33 billion in losses in 2023, making it unsurprising that the Florida insurance industry is now a significantly different sector than it was at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.', ""Yet, while the US casualty insurance industry might be out of trouble for now, the first quarter of 2023 has also seen another sector become the center of media attention. This is the health insurance sector that seemingly got caught in the middle of a feud between law enforcement and ransomware organizations. One of America's biggest insurance companies, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), saw its claims processing disrupted in a cyberattack that saw reverberations all over America. This wasn't the end of the intrigue, as while UNH has since recovered, the group said to be responsible for the attack has pulled off a disappearing act."", ""According to Reuters, the ransomware group BlackHat's website now claims that the group has been taken down by coordinated action from law enforcement agencies. However, all agencies mentioned have either refused or failed to comment or outright denied disrupting the infrastructure."", 'Thought only casualty and health insurance were facing disruptions? Think again as March 2024 has also seen Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company inform nearly 30,000 customers that a data breach led to sensitive details such as Social Security numbers being compromised. For more on the UNH hack, you can also take a look at the 12 Best Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. To add to this, the collapse of the Francis Scott Bridge in Baltimore is also making marine insurers tremble. Experts believe that the partial bridge collapse could set new records in marine insurance, and some estimates believe that a payout could sit at a whopping $4 billion.', 'So, as the US insurance battles new challenges in the age of artificial intelligence, we decided to see which insurance companies in America have the greatest assets.

That growth was largely driven by its brisk sales of data center GPUs for processing AI tasks."", ""The market's appetite for those high-end GPUs could continue to outstrip Nvidia's available supply for the foreseeable future. Its revenue soared 126% in fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), and analysts expect it to maintain a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 as the artificial intelligence (AI) market expands."", ""The bulls believe Nvidia still has plenty of room to run, even as AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) ramps up its production of its own AI GPUs and major customers like OpenAI and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) start developing their own in-house chips. However, a new threat might be emerging: Some of the world's largest tech companies have formed a new open-source alliance to prevent Nvidia from dominating the AI market with its closed-source programming platform."", ""To develop apps optimized for Nvidia's GPUs, software developers need to access the chipmaker's closed-source CUDA (Computer Unified Device Architecture) programming platform. Those developers would need to access other programming platforms -- like Intel's OneAPI and AMD's MIOpen -- to port their applications to other brands of GPUs."", ""Since Nvidia already dominates the data center GPU market, there's not much of an incentive for developers to rewrite their applications for other GPU brands. Many of Nvidia's critics believe the symbiotic relationship between its GPUs and CUDA platform supports its near-monopolization the GPU market and locks in its software developers."", ""That's why it wasn't too surprising when Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Qualcomm, Samsung, Arm, Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Cloud, Broadcom's Vmware, Fujitsu, and Imagination Technologies recently teamed up to create the UXL (Unified Acceleration) Foundation."", 'The UXL Foundation plans to use Intel\'s OneAPI as a foundation to create an open-source alternative to Nvidia\'s CUDA platform. It doesn\'t plan to release its first ""mature"" platform until the second half of this year, but its arrival could potentially loosen Nvidia\'s iron grip on the GPU software and hardware markets.', ""These tech titans clearly want to challenge Nvidia's dominance of the AI market, but the UXL Foundation probably won't make much near-term progress for three simple reasons."", ""First, Nvidia still develops the world's most powerful data center GPUs. Even though its customers are dealing with supply constraints for its newest GPUs, they won't abruptly switch over to Intel or AMD's discrete GPUs just to save a few dollars."", ""That's why the vast majority of Google Cloud's GPUs are still Nvidia chips, even though it's been gradually developing and testing its own first-party chips in recent years. Therefore, a battle between the CUDA and UXL platforms won't even matter unless one of the GPU underdogs takes a meaningful bite out of Nvidia's dominant market share."", ""Second, AMD -- Nvidia's closest competitor in the discrete GPU race -- hasn't joined the UXL Foundation yet. Another missing tech giant is OpenAI's top backer, Microsoft, which recently started buying AMD's AI GPUs. Therefore, AMD and Microsoft might be quietly working on more ways to promote AMD's MIOpen as an open-source alternative to CUDA and UXL. That fragmentation could, ironically, weaken the open-source push against CUDA and indirectly help Nvidia."", ""Lastly, the UXL Foundation plans to expand its open-source programming platform to Nvidia's GPUs in the future. That roadmap might make it easier for developers to optimize their software for a wider range of GPUs, but it also seems to be a blatant admission that Nvidia will remain the 800-pound gorilla of the GPU market."", ""Nvidia's stock dipped after the UXL announcement, but I think it's a lot of sound and fury that signifies nothing. These big tech companies are teaming up to create an open-source alternative to CUDA, but that alliance is missing two major players and isn't co-developing any new chips that could actually challenge Nvidia.

At the time, I admired the strength of its digital media products, the stickiness of its subscriptions, its stable growth rates, and its reasonable valuations.', 'However, I trimmed my position last August and sold the remaining shares for a slight profit following the release of its first-quarter earnings report on March 14. These are the five core issues that changed my opinion about the cloud services giant.', 'Adobe generates nearly three-quarters of its revenue from its Digital Media segment, which houses its flagship Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro services. The rest comes from its Digital Experience services for enterprise customers. Both business divisions grappled with slower sales growth over the past two fiscal years.', 'Metric', 'FY 2021', 'FY 2022', 'FY 2023', 'Digital Media Revenue Growth', '25%', '11%', '11%', 'Digital Experience Revenue Growth', '24%', '14%', '11%', 'Total Revenue Growth', '23%', '12%', '10%', 'Data source: Adobe.', 'For the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (which started last December), Adobe expects its revenue to only rise 9%-10% year over year. For the full year, analysts anticipate 11% growth.', ""Adobe blames some of that slowdown on the macro headwinds, but the competitive landscape is also evolving. Figma has been gaining ground against Adobe XD in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) software design markets. Canva, which had already been chipping away at Photoshop with its online image editing tools, recently acquired Affinity to expand its suite of digital media editing services. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), which integrated OpenAI's generative AI tools into its Bing Image Creator and Designer platforms, is evolving into a competitor with its text-to-image creation services."", ""Adobe's responses to these threats aren't reassuring. It initially tried to buy Figma in Sept. 2022, but regulatory hurdles forced it to abandon the $20 billion deal last December -- and forced it to pay its growing competitor a $1 billion termination fee instead. Adobe responded to the seismic shift toward generative AI by expanding its own Firefly platform for creating images and digital models, but that effort hasn't meaningfully boosted its revenue yet."", 'To offset its persistent slowdown, Adobe is cutting costs, raising its prices, and buying back shares to boost its earnings per share (EPS). Yet those tactics make it more similar to a slow-growth tobacco company instead of a high-growth tech giant.', 'Adobe raised the prices of its Creative Cloud services by about 10% in late 2023. Therefore, most of its growth this year will likely be driven by price hikes for its existing customers instead of the organic expansion of its customer base.', ""And during Adobe's latest earnings report, its management announced a new $25 billion buyback plan. That seemed like a move to appease investors after it failed to buy Figma, but earmarking all that cash for buybacks doesn't make much sense when it should be making bigger and bolder investments to widen its competitive moat."", ""Adobe's future growth relies heavily on its ability to lock customers into its subscriptions. However, it recently disclosed that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had launched a probe into those subscription cancellation policies."", 'The FTC has been investigating Adobe\'s policy of charging prorated penalties to customers who cancel their subscriptions after the first 14 days. Adobe admitted that it could incur ""significant monetary costs or penalties"" to settle that investigation, while the FTC could reduce the stickiness of its cloud services by banning its cancellation fees.', ""Analysts expect Adobe's adjusted earnings to grow 12% this year. Based on that forecast, its stock might seem reasonably valued at 28 times this year's earnings."", ""But Microsoft, which is growing at a faster rate, trades at 31 times forward earnings. Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), which competes against Adobe in the enterprise software market, is also growing faster and trades at 31 times forward earnings. Therefore it doesn't make much sense to invest in Adobe's troubled business when you can pay a slightly higher multiple for Microsoft or Salesforce. That might be why Adobe's insiders sold more shares than they bought over the past 12 months, even as its board greenlit another buyback plan equivalent to 11% of its market cap."", ""Adobe's stock might bounce back if it gets its act together, but the red flags are too bright to ignore.

Gentlemen, great to have you both here."", 'Matt Argersinger: Hey, Dylan.', 'Andy Cross: Hey, Dylan.', ""Dylan Lewis: We've got a run-down on retail, the state of things at Paramount and of course, stocks on our radar. But we're kicking off with real estate news, Matt, after several years and lawsuits related to excessive fees and antitrust activity, we might be looking at a new real estate market."", ""Matt Argersinger: We might be, Dylan, if you ever sold a home. It's always been confounding well, at least for me, that in addition to paying a commission to your agent, in that case, the seller's agent or the listing agent, you'd also have to pay a 2.5, 3% commission to the buyer's agent. And this was essentially, for decades, a mandate of the National Association of Realtors, NAR, of which the vast majority of agents in the US are members of. It's why commissions on transacting home haven't traditionally been set in this 5-6% range, split evenly, usually by the seller's agent and the buyer's agent."", ""So instantaneously on every transaction, in addition to other closing costs, repair expenses, 5-6% of your homes' equity would instantly, that had been built up maybe for over many years, and worth tens of thousands of dollars would instantly go away for these commissions. It always seemed like one of the final areas of the market that had yet to be disrupted. Because if you think about what's happened to travel agents, what's happened to brokerage commissions, certainly transacting and almost everything in the country has gotten cheaper overtime except transacting a house."", ""If you look at the median price of a home in the US, right around $400,000, that's 20,000 or more in commissions just to sell a house. But here we are. The NAR has essentially settled, which means they are not contesting any more of these lawsuits, the civil action suits against them, they're paying a fee and the idea is that they're going to lose their monopoly position on the marketplace. Now, agents won't be required to be members of the NAR."", ""They won't be forced, for example, to subscribe to MLS listings already get paid and essentially makes real estate agents, free agents that can set their own commissions. And if you're a home seller, or a homebuyer, gives you far more negotiating power. You can pay a commission to a buyer that you want to pay, and it's no longer causing a mandate to pay a commission to the other side of the transaction."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, and looking at this news, I was trying to process both the news itself and then the follow-on impact that it would have. And I feel like for buyers and sellers, we're probably looking at lower fees and a little bit more flexibility. Beyond that in the business landscape of real estate, I feel like it's really hard to nail down what it means for companies like Zillow, Redfin, and other operators."", ""Matt Argersinger: I think clearly for the publicly traded agencies, this is not going to be great news. I mean, those fees are coming down, their margins have to come down. The business is going to change. There's going to be less agents in the marketplace. For companies like Redfin and Zillow, it is a little cloudy for me, because for one, Redfin who has already trying to disrupt the whole transaction fee of this marketplace anyway and with Zillow, Zillow really depends on the vast majority of its revenue still comes from agents who pays a low for leads on their marketplace."", ""They need agents, and they depend on the traditional model. So for Zillow, it's also could be disruptive, although a little confusing. I would just say this, good real estate agents do deserve to get paid. I don't want to make it seem like these commissions were being paid out the door for nothing. I mean, many work really hard. I've worked with agents that had been great. They spent a lot of time working with buyers or sellers, and they deal with a lot of paperwork. There's a lot of value to what they do. So I feel like it's still, in a way, it makes the marketplace better for them because I think good agents will thrive. Good agents will still get paid. A lot of agents who were just living off these richly undeserved agent commissions will not thrive."", ""Dylan Lewis: This week we've also got updates in AI sending tech companies in two different directions. We're going to kick off looking at Adobe here, Andy. Company reported earlier this week, results were good, but it seems like the guidance and the general outlook on how AI might be affecting the business has the market concerned."", ""Andy Cross: Yeah. Dylan, it's like that Damocles hanging over Adobe. AI is just waiting for that string to catch, to end up doing some serious damage to this company. This is a company that's been in investing in AI for a long time. Their Firefly solution, since its launch, now has more than 6.5 billion images created. They're investing in this space, and they talk a lot about this. However, even though that quarter was really quite good, revenues up 11%, adjusted earnings per share up 18%. They didn't have to pay a billion-dollar fee for the Figma transaction getting canceled. Their digital media revenue was up 12%."", ""Their ending annual recurring revenue, which is very important when you think about this business, up 14%. The Document Cloud business, which is part of their solutions and part of this package, was up 23%. So that's really impressive. Their digital experience revenue, that's their new marketing business they've been growing. That was up 10% with remaining performance obligations up 16%. So the quarter was all really positive, very good. However, it was all in the conversation about the guide in their future revenues, thinking about the bookings and how artificial intelligence is or is not impacting their business."", ""Especially it's things like OpenAI Sora, which is their text to video creating device and how much that's impacting, not just creating videos and imaging, but also giving clients the ability to edit those. Lots of conversations around what that means for their business. They didn't come out very enthusiastic about the guide going forward. Lots of conversations around with the analysts about what this means after minutia at the timings at this quarter, next quarter, a lot of concerns that so much of the growth of the year is going to be back-ended into the second half."", ""Clearly you see the stock reacting, more down 13% as we're going into tape this. The market clearly having some discussions and some hesitations about Adobe, which is the leader in this space. By the way, the stock has done very well over the last year. So I think the most pullback maybe a little ahead of itself and this is some of the pullback we're seeing."", ""Dylan Lewis: A different story with AI over at Oracle. This is a company that is catching the tailwinds of AI. Matt shares up 10% this week following the company's fiscal Q3 report. Thanks in large part to demand for the company's Cloud offerings."", ""Matt Argersinger: Absolutely. I mean, if you look at the headlines, revenue up 7%, adjusted EPS up 16%, both better-than-expected, but the two likely reasons, and you hit one of them, the stock has been up so much. First Oracle's remaining performance obligation, RPO, Andy mentioned this for Adobe as well. This is basically sales that Oracle is contractually obligated to fulfill, but hasn't yet quite recognize as revenue or if you're a simple investor like me, it's called backlog."", ""That's up to 80 billion, up 29% year over year. So that's just revenue growth is going to continue to be fairly robust going forward for Oracle. But the Cloud revenue for Oracle, 25% year over year, Cloud infrastructure business, 49% increase year over year. That's the piece that really competes with the bigger at Cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft's Azure."", ""You can conclude right there that Oracle is gaining market share. The big reason for that is a CEOs Safra Catz, demand for Oracle's Artificial Intelligence Cloud capabilities far exceeding supply. To address this, Oracle actually signed a new agreement with Nvidia in the quarter, investing heavily in opening and expanding its data center network. The AI plug in here for Oracle is very real and very robust, and it's got investors really excited about the business, obviously."", 'Dylan Lewis: Matt, right there, you name checked a lot of the big companies and brands that we associate with cloud discussion, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon. We have generally left Oracle out of the conversation for the big Cloud players, do you feel like we need to start bringing them into that group?', ""Matt Argersinger: I think so. This might eventually become a big four with Oracle. Because if you think on Oracle, all the other three companies that you mentioned all have big leads, big market shares, but they're also doing very different things in a lot of different markets. Amazon in particular, Alphabet of course, with advertising and YouTube. This is Oracle's business. I mean, database networking Cloud infrastructure is their business. It's their focus. I think they're going to continue to gain market share."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break over at Under Armour, it's meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis joined in studio with Matt Argersinger and Andy Cross. We've got a rundown on retail and apparel. We're going to start things off with Williams-Sonoma, a huge week for them, Andy, shares up 18% following the company's earnings release. Even though net income declined year over year and revenue was basically flat. Andy, what's going on here?"", ""Andy Cross: Well, on the earnings per share, because they buy back so much stock, it was actually up a little bit just 3%, but far ahead of analysts' estimates and the sales were down 7%. Again ahead of estimates was much better than how management had guided. Laura Alber has been leading Williams-Sonoma for so many years, so successfully years. I think very conservative when she thinks about running this company, she and her team. Been talking about the challenging market."", ""We're having comp sales down. Almost 7%, that was better than two years ago but worse than a year ago. The four-year company, you go back four years, Williams-Sonoma Lakes have focused on that pre-pandemic. They were up almost 30%. I mentioned the earnings per share, gross margins is where they won Dylan in this quarter. Higher merchandise margins, lower supply costs. Williams-Sonoma has been really effective at managing their supply costs."", ""Being very efficient as how they have taken out more and more costs from their supply chain, how the pricing is starting to impact that. They've been talking about that for the past year, which is one reason why their stock has done so well. That allows them to get more efficient when it comes at gross margin up at 46% versus 41% a year ago. The inventories were down 14%. Again, they're just managing this business, blocking and tackling very well."", ""Operating cash flow was up 60% for the year. But because they've been so efficient on their capital expenditure, free cash flow more than doubled, that allowed them to announce a 26% increase in the dividend certainly helps with the stock price performing so well. Even though comps really for the year where basically down across the board and for the quarter."", ""Dylan Lewis: Andy, this is probably not accompanying that a lot of people necessarily have on their radar and it is to their detriment. Shares up 140% over the last 12 months. It's been an incredible performer. The stock is currently at all-time highs for people that maybe haven't been following this business. Do you feel like the valuation is in a good spot or do you think it's getting a little rich?"", ""Andy Cross: Here's just some context behind that. I'm a fan of Williams-Sonoma and a shareholder and we've recommended the stock in lots of different spots here at The Motley Fool. The market cap is more than 18 billion. It sells at around an earnings multiple of around 20 times. Historically their earnings multiple is more in the low double-digits or call it the 12, 13, 15 times range. When it got so cheap, it got down to single digits, which is one reason why the stock has done so well. If you want to nibble, fine, don't go all rushing, but put it on your watchlist. Certainly, if you don't have it as one to keep an eye on."", 'Dylan Lewis: We have a less glamorous story going on over at Under Armour. News out this week that founder Kevin Plank will be stepping back into the CEO role and Matt, the market did not seem too excited about it.', ""Matt Argersinger: Not at all, Dylan. The stock sold off pretty hard. I think there's a few reasons for this, which we'll get into. One, it's interesting, the current or now former CEO, Stephanie Linnartz, she's only on the job for about a year and she was in the first year of what she thought was going to be a three-year turnaround for the business. Clearly, that turnaround is not happening to the satisfaction of the board and probably to a lot of investors."", ""But I just found that press release from Under Armour very short, very vague. I felt like this needed a letter from Kevin Plank saying why he's coming back, why he thinks it's important for him to step back into the CEO role. We didn't get that. We just got a pretty short press release. That's interesting. If you look at Under Armour stock, it's been stuck in the low single-digits for what seems like forever. Maybe there's a little bit of desperation here, but you have to remember how Plank left the CEO spot in 2019. Putting aside his various personal scandals, he didn't leave the company in exactly a great state."", ""Revenue growth had already flatlined for a few years, he made several poor acquisitions to try to digitize the brand. Inventory hadn't been managed well. They failed to gain traction at leisure market which I feel they basically invented it. Yet they see that to Lululemon and Nike and others. This isn't Steve Jobs coming back to the doors. This is not Howard Schultz coming in or Michael Dell coming back. A founder that's going to come back and lead the company to glory. I think that's why the market is taking a very cautious look here and saying this is a CEO with a pretty tumultuous tenure at the end. Coming back can a turnaround really happen now?"", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, I have not sold very many stocks that I've owned and when I have almost without exception, it has been the wrong decision. The exception to that is Under Armour. [laughs] I sold my shares, I think when it was in the mid-teens and this business has not managed to get back on track. It's down about 50% from then. Recently, shares are at their lowest level in almost a decade. What is the return to normal even look like for this business?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I don't know, Dylan. Unfortunately, I'm still a shareholder, and Under Armour withheld throughout. You see the stocks at a 10-year low. I looked at it. It's about a 17-year low in the stock price. But this is a situation where I step back and say, wait a second, how much worse can this actually get? Because if you look at Under Armour's stock, it's trading for about 0.6 times revenue. For comparison, Nike trades at three times revenue."", ""The stock's at a 17-year low. This is the kind that still generates healthy cash from operations. We were talking about before the show, that the brand has to have some equity value. That's probably greater or somewhere in the vicinity of three billion, which is its market cap. Maybe it can't get worse and just maybe Kevin Plank finds a little bit of that entrepreneurial magic he had early on in Under Armour. Three years from now, four years from now we're looking at Under Armour and it's $25 stock."", 'Andy Cross: Six dangerous words in an estimate. How much lower can this go? Just be mindful of that.', ""Dylan Lewis: You're pumping the brakes there a little bit there Andy."", 'Andy Cross: Be cautious there.', ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to wrap the company updates with a look at Ulta Andy, shares the cosmetic company down 5% after earnings. What's the story here?"", ""Andy Cross: It's interesting, the quarter was actually pretty good. It wasn't anything to really crow about. Revenues were up almost 10%. Earnings at $8.08 ahead of estimates so that was actually quite strong. Their comp sales were at 2.5% but that was versus 16% a year ago so a pretty good deceleration and a little bit lower than the estimates, which I think is what has the stock lower."", ""Transactions up 4.5% but pricing or average cost of the goods that someone buys down almost 2%. The gross margin was up a little bit. Lower shipping, better supply chain costs. Same thing was we sold Williams-Sonoma. I don't think quite as effective at Ulta, but a little bit better, but lower on the merchandise margin, which was different than what we saw at Williams-Sonoma. Sales gross and operating margin the cost down at 23.1% versus 23.6%."", ""They're doing a pretty good job of managing the cost that boosted the operating margin to 14.5% versus 13.9%. A lot of numbers there, but ultimately, they've done a pretty good job managing the cost in a relatively slower-growth business. Skincare up very much. One interesting little tidbit there. They talked about the sales for the makeup category decreased in low-single-digit range. They saw softness in prestige cosmetics was partially offset by growth in mass makeup. They pointed at Elf Beauty as one of the ones that are doing pretty well at Ulta."", ""Dylan Lewis: It's interesting. I haven't taken a look at the quarter, but I'm wondering if they said anything about shrink or anything like that, Andy. I don't know if you guys caught it, I only caught a little bit of it, but CNBC did this pretty large report this past week about retail theft. I can't remember the exact story, but I guess there was a ring of resellers who had stolen millions of dollars and Ulta is one of the big victims here of just ceiling this high-margin makeup, reselling it, pocketing the difference and I know they made some arrest. But it was a remarkable story."", ""Matt Argersinger: It was a huge enterprise, actually a criminal enterprise. Now I think this quarter didn't get nearly the tension as we've seen in the past. I think you'll see that they're starting to peak a little bit in there talking about shrink I think but it still continues to be an issue. The guidance, by the way, just very quickly is that comp sales at 4-5% versus 5.7%. That's for the full year guided ahead. Comp sales for this year ahead, not quite as good as last year."", ""Dylan Lewis: I'm glad you brought up the shrink story there, Matt because I remember looking at Target's results earlier this earnings season and I think it was two quarters ago, shrink was the narrative. They made that statement, I think it was a $500 million adjustment. Some of the numbers that they were looking out for the year saying that shrink was the culprit."", ""We didn't see a lot of headlines on that. We didn't see a lot of discussion of that with the most recent earnings release but we've actually dig into management's calls. It came up 12 times. It is still a story for some of these retailers and we're still hearing management talk about it but it seems like one of those things that has crested as a wave already when it comes to financials."", ""Matt Argersinger: When CNBC does a special report or in a special documentary and something that usually as Andy alluded to, it's looked at the peak but it might be one of those situations where hopefully companies are figuring it out and moving on."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt Argersinger, Andy Cross, fellows, we're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next, we dig into the turmoil at Paramount and the possible path forward for the entertainment giant. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Award season is over, but there's still plenty of drama unfolding in Hollywood. Motley Fool Money is Ricky Mulvey caught up with Bloomberg entertainment reporter Lucas Shaw for a look at the business of streaming, the power of incentives and corporate infighting at Paramount."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It's a tough time to be a movie company, but do you think there's starting to be a greater willingness to go for those singles and doubles now that there's some adult dramas that are doing poorly. Ferrari did not make money. But Anyone but You, which was a romantic comedy made more than 200 million at the box office. Like A24 eked out a profit with Iron Claw. So is that door continuing to open a little bit for those adult dramas that used to just go to streaming."", ""Lucas Shaw: I get very mixed signals on this and I think it's hard to answer that holistically. I don't think that these companies are giving up the Tentpole strategy, which is, let's have a handful of really expensive, really big movies. Because when those hit, they make so much money that it pays for everything else. They can't really move away from that for that reason. But you do see certain studios. I think Universal, Sony, and Warner Brothers, foremost among them making a wide range of movies, believing that there is value in having to use your metaphor, a single or a double, in addition to the home run."", ""If you look at the types of programming that Netflix is going to do, I think they are going to take fewer really big swings and make more movies. That cost in the 20-$100 million range, which is, I don't know that it's going to be a bunch of dramas. I think it's going to be comedy, and thriller, and action, and things like that. But I do think you'll see a good number of movies made that are in that middle that the big studios had really forsaken over the last several years."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, and I want to own a move to Paramount, which you covered in a story called How Paramount Became A Cautionary Tale Of The Streaming Wars. The only thing on their upcoming slate seems to be those big Tentpole films after the Bob Marley movie, and they did Mean Girls. But then upcoming it seems that it's a Transformers movie, they're going to do a PAW patrol movie and it's not these small movies. They might have trouble attracting creators right now to get those smaller to midsize movies for their studio."", ""Lucas Shaw: The problems at Paramount have made it very hard for that studio to do deals. I've spoken with executives there who've been very pleasantly surprised, I should say, at some of the talent who've reupped their relationships with the studio, including John Krasinski though, filmmaker of A Quiet Place. But you talked to a lot of producers and they're pretty clear that Paramount would be their last choice, both because it's a company that just hasn't made that many movies."", ""Other than basically Top Gun, hasn't delivered a lot of huge hits. But I think more than anything because of the uncertainty at the corporate level where you have a controlling shareholder in Shari Redstone who pretty clearly would like to sell the business, is looking for buyers, is struggling to find buyers. She's looking to exit, not because this is a great time to sell and you can get a great deal, but because the business has been declining and she wants to get out while she still can."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Can you take us into the informal auction going on for for Paramount right now. Where's that sit?"", ""Lucas Shaw: Actually, you know what? Let's let's take it back a step. I think Shari decided that she wanted to sell at some point last year. Some people say over the summer, some people say in the fall. Either way, she had been approached over the years by a few parties. She really started late last year talking to David Ellison, who runs a company called Skydance, whose father is Larry Ellison, one of the richest men in the world. David Ellison's company is a co-financier and producer of Top Gun, of the Mission Impossible movies, of Star Trek movies, all Paramount biggest franchises."", ""David Ellison would like to buy Shari Redstone out of National Amusements, which is the family holding company, a movie theater chain that has the stake in Paramount and then merge his company with Paramount. The challenge with this is that while that deal is great for Shari Redstone, it's not necessarily great for Paramount. I think there's some people who are skeptical about why you would want to merge with Skydance other than because David Ellison wants them to and there would certainly be a dispute over valuation."", ""So you've got Shari Redstone and her camp looking to see if there are other bidders. Because anytime you're trying to sell, you want to have multiple bidders so you can drive up the price. So she's talked to David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Brothers discovery. She's talked to Apollo, the private equity firm, and she's talked to some other potential buyers. At the same time, you've got the company of Paramount with advisors looking to see if there are other offers because they don't necessarily love this David Ellison idea."", ""That's the state of play. We know that David Ellison is interested and has at least made a preliminary offer. We know there have been conversations with a couple of other parties, but it's not clear that there is another tangible offer or real buyer on the table right now for the company. So it's an open question as to whether they're going to get a deal done."", 'Ricky Mulvey: In the past, Netflix was a part of the conversation. Warner Brothers discovery looked at it briefly.', ""Lucas Shaw: It should be noted. I should just on that point, that yes, Netflix has been part of the conversation, but Netflix was part of the conversation in so much as it wanted to buy just the studio, Paramount Pictures. I think there are a lot of entities that would be happy to buy just the studio because it's got a good library that they could exploit and film and television, it's got, honestly great real estate that lot in Hollywood alone is worth billions of dollars."", ""The problem is that if you're Shari Redstone and you don't want to sell just the studio because it's your most valuable asset. So then you're left with a bunch of stuff nobody wants. If you're a buyer, it's the stuff nobody wants. Like you don't necessarily want to take these declining cable networks. So it's going to be interesting to see Shari Redstone's probably going to have to sell at a discount to unload the stuff that nobody wants in order to unload the whole company."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It seems that there has been a little bit of pride when they've had offers on the table. BET was one of them where the deal is off by a billion dollars, so everybody walks away. Now Paramount may get to a point where there's no option other than the buyer that's willing to take on the company."", ""Lucas Shaw: Yeah. I mean, it's crazy that they almost sold. They could have sold BET, they could've sold Showtime. That would have raised enough money between the two of them. If they did the deals, they probably could've gotten 4.5-5 billion dollars, that would solved a lot of problems. They could have paid off a lot of debt. They could have funded a bunch of stuff for the streaming service and yeah, they just didn't want to do it."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Is the cardinal misstep that Paramount made with streaming, which is their main loser of money. Just that they were late to the party or were there other mistakes along the way?', ""Lucas Shaw: They were definitely late. But that was not the cardinal sin because every company was late and every company that went in is facing the same conundrum right now, whether it's Paramount, or Warner Brothers Discovery, or Disney, or in a lesser way, Comcast because there are more diversified enterprise. But entities that have a bunch of cable networks are just watching as they fall into the sea and their streaming service is not rising fast enough."", ""So should they have moved faster? Yes, Disney moved a little bit faster. Having a lot of the same problems. I think the issue is that this was always going to be painful and you have this incredibly lucrative business that was going away and entities that made a lot of money from that business were not going to rush to kill it. It's the the classic innovator's dilemma that people talk about. Netflix was able to come in as a new player and disrupt this business and none of the competition moved fast or move quickly enough to respond."", 'I do think that Paramount has made some specific missteps. I mean, you look at it and I should also say Paramount was hamstrung by the corporate infighting. There were two separate entities, CBS and Viacom, that the Redstones controlled. Shari Redstone had to spend many years fighting to cement family control over them in disputes with management of both companies, when she did actually put it together. That then took a while to make it happen. So there were a lot of hurdles to making it work. Then they spent a lot of money really quickly.', ""They didn't think about it. All these companies made the same mistake. They had to try to compress 15 years of Netflix's building into a short time frame and we can debate, is there any way in which that would have gone well? Or was it just a function of going late and I'm not sure the answer. I'm sure that there were sounder strategies with these companies. I also think that had they acted five-years earlier, there's no guarantee it would have worked."", ""Ricky Mulvey: On Paramount, Shari Redstone wants a buyer. What happens if Paramount doesn't find a buyer?"", ""Lucas Shaw: It's a good question. It's the one facing all of these enterprises. Then Shari faces a couple of options. She can stay the course and believe that we've suffered maximum pain right now and the streaming service is going to keep growing, or we're going to manage costs and we'll figure it out. I don't think Wall Street would be very happy to hear that because it isn't working right now. There's a strategy where they resort to selling individual pieces again or where they halt costs a bit more. Then there's a more dramatic one which some have proposed which I still don't see them doing."", ""But this notion of them becoming a pure arms dealer, which means that they shut down the streaming service and just be a studio and sell the others. But considering that that company makes basically all of its money from cable networks and to some extent from streaming. That's where most of the employees are. That would require, I should say, gutting the business. You'd fire 50-80% of the staff, which is why I see that is unlikely but she'll have to have to make some big changes if she cuts it because if they come out and say, they haven't officially said that they're for sale but if there was a bunch of coverage basically saying that the deal talks were over, their stocks is going to tank."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I think there's also an interesting angle on this with the power of incentives. I want to talk about David Zaslav in a sec, but in this case, there's an early misstep from the CEO, Philipe Dauman, this guy was making so much money in stock awards. He incentivized to boost the stock price and then in order to do so, he's buying back stock, which means they're not investing into content and growing the business for the long term."", ""Lucas Shaw: Philipe Dauman, really one of the worst media CEOs of the last 20-plus years, I would say. Maybe, ever. He took what was one of the most vibrant and great businesses, in Viacom, drove it into the ground. He didn't understand Netflix, he didn't understand YouTube and rather than invest a bunch of money in streaming, which he should've done because they had the networks that were most exposed. MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, they speak to young people so you could see the trends early. I"", 'nstead of investing in streaming, he just bought back a bunch of stock. He did whatever he could to prop up the share price and it was really destructive to the enterprise long term. All the mistakes that Shari Redstone and Bob Bakish may or may not have made Philipe made more. Sumner Redstone, who was in charge of the company at the time and was the was the owner, they deserve the largest share of the blame, no question.', ""Ricky Mulvey: I wonder if there's an incentive problem right now. If Warner Brothers discovery and you've talked about it on the town, where David Zaslav has compensation award tied to the free cash flow of the business. I was talking to one of our investment analysts, Tim Buyers earlier. Basically, that's an uncommon way to incentivize a CEO. Feel free to break down this theory but now you have HBO or the company that's essentially shelved movies, one of which recently was the Wiley Coyote vs Acme movie. You get a tax loss on that, which is going to boost. You get the immediate boost of free cash flow but then, you might be killing ideas, drawing away creators."", ""Lucas Shaw: It's a question of whether he's incentivized to just cut cost to make cash flow look good and get himself paid more rather than act in the best interest of the company. It's a tough press. I don't think that David Zaslav made free cash and the Board made free cash flow the most important metric for his pay just because they knew that they were going to cut costs. I think they wanted to set the target. We have all this debt and we need to save money to pay it off. How are we going to incentivize people to do that? We're going to incentivize them to generate free cash flow and that's what they did."", ""That being said, it's just a terrible look for this guy who's about to get paid a ton of money, even though their stock is in the toilet, nobody thinks the company is performing very well. By the way, that free cash flow being the metric for performance and how people are paid, that doesn't apply to most of the employees of that company. It mostly applies to David Zaslav and maybe the inner circle. They're really perverse incentives there."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Listeners, you can catch Lucas Shaw on X. He is @Lucas_Shaw. Coming up after the break, Andy Cross and Matt Argersinger return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Dylan Lewis: As always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis joined again by Matt Argersinger and Andy Cross. If you went all in on the Stanley tumbler craze, you're going to have to make room in your cupboard for another weird household item that has caught fire. Andy, grocer Trader Joe's began selling mini tote bags for $3 in March. They are now selling for hundreds of dollars online. What are you make of this new consumer craze?"", ""Andy Cross: How many is many on the per square inch of tote bags? This has got to be a record if they're really small. We just bought a Stanley for $35 at REI and those things are some serious piece of hardware. We're now part of the Stanley craze, I think we have two of them now at the house so I can understand that. If it's me, when I go to Trader Joe's, I buy a lot of stuff. I'm bringing tote bags, hanging them on my shoulder, pulling them out of my jackets. Minis are not helping me very much."", 'Dylan Lewis: I think you timed the market well on that. I think you got in on the tumblers slightly after the peak and maybe have a good cost basis there. Matt, what do you make of these consumer phrases?', ""Matt Argersinger: I can't speak to this. I'm a guy who takes brown bags run reused bags to the grocery store and reuses them so I have I can't believe people are paying $100 for tote bags. I cannot believe it."", ""Dylan Lewis: I'm just happy people are using reusable bags. That makes me happy."", 'Andy Cross: There you go.', ""Dylan Lewis: I'll take that. Let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question. Matt, you're up first this week, what are you looking at?"", ""Matt Argersinger: Weird special situation here, Equity Commonwealth, the ticker is EQC. Equity Commonwealth, it's a two billion dollar real estate investment trust with 2.2 billion in net cash. Do the math there. Yes, it's trading below the cash on its balance sheet. Now it does own four office buildings that are cash-flowing but materially they're a very small part of the story here. Management is essentially sitting on 2.2 billion in cash collecting 5% with treasuries, which is good but waiting to make a transformative investment for the business."", ""The problem is they've been sitting on their hands for quite a while now. Investors are starting to get a little impatient and now there's a hedge fund called Land and Buildings Investment Management, LLC. That's a mouthful them but they own 3% of EQC shares, and they've submitted a letter demanding that EQC actually liquidate the business because under their model, liquidating the business would actually result in a net asset value of about 20% above where EQC is trading in the public markets. We'll have to see if this gets any traction. But I think it's a fastening situation to watch over the next few months."", ""Dylan Lewis: Dan, a special situation with Equity Commonwealth. What's your question?"", ""Dan Boyd: A special situation is called for, it doesn't make any dang sense. I'm sorry, are you trying to sell us on cash or office buildings, Mattie?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I think cash but it sounds like I'm actually trying to sell Dan a tote bag from Trader Joe's Andy, you're going to be able to beat that? What's on your radar?"", ""Andy Cross: I got Landstar guys, LSTR, an asset-light logistics company that generates more than five billion in sales, market cap value almost seven billion more cash than debt. It's an asset-light business, so it doesn't really own a lot of the assets. It uses technology to help clients, which is more than 25,000 customers across 1,100 independent agents. Basically get our goods from point A to point Z. Mostly inter-modal trucking, van shipments but also some Aaron Freight."", ""They help make sense of all the logistics challenges to be able to get all our stuff from when we buy it to when we want to consume it. Now it's been a tough two years post-pandemic because we're not buying as much stuff. Inventories are going lower. Companies are trying to run down all those inventories. You're just not seeing the volumes come across their net worth. That's been a big hit to their sales and to their profits. But this is a very talented management team. They focus very heavily on returns on capital and free cash flow. Ultimately in a pretty good spot, I think for Landstar."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Landstar.', 'Dan Boyd: First off, absolutely gorgeous stock chart here for the maximum time since they came out in 1993, whatever, just up until the right you love to see it But this is one of those companies where you read about it and you got to read four paragraphs to figure out the day. Make technology or make programming to help people do trucking. Not crazy about this company.', ""Andy Cross: But that's the magic behind Dan. Two tough businesses this week, Dan, which one's going on your watchlist?"", ""Dan Boyd: Well, I'm not going with whatever Mattie said Come on. I don't even know what he was talking about."", ""Dylan Lewis: Landstar wins. Matt, Andy, I appreciate you being here. That's going to do it for us.

Tech stocks like Amazon and Microsoft have accomplished such feats for long-term investors.', 'But since these companies have matured and are growing more slowly, the goal is to find the next Microsoft. The following two small companies have growth prospects that could translate into millionaire-making potential.', 'DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN) might not look like a millionaire maker at first glance. It is one of many cloud infrastructure providers, and with competitors such as Amazon and Microsoft, you might wonder how it can compete with a market cap of less than $4 billion.', 'DigitalOcean primarily serves small and medium-size businesses (SMBs), which account for 33 million enterprises in the U.S. alone, according to the Small Business Administration. To this end, the company has developed a business model that the larger players cannot compete against without undermining their own businesses.', 'For one, it has transparent pricing, meaning businesses simply buy the services they need. Second, it offers the DigitalOcean Community, a combination of educational materials and access to its other users that can help small businesses solve IT-related problems without expensive personnel.', 'Moreover, the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) will likely stoke demand for its services. Nvidia H100 AI chips can cost about $30,000 each, too costly for most SMBs. But DigitalOcean can offer access to this technology through its Paperspace platform, making it more likely SMBs will turn to the company.', 'This value proposition likely helped revenue in 2023 reach $693 million, 20% more than in 2022. And thanks to efforts to limit operating expense growth, DigitalOcean turned a profit, earning $19 million in net income; it lost $28 million in the previous year.', ""The stock's behavior points to some uncertainty. Shares only rose 15% over the last year and still sells at a 70% discount to its 2021 high. Furthermore, the company has recently undergone changes at the top, appointing Paddy Srinivasan as its new CEO in February."", 'Srinivasan has extensive leadership experience in the industry, most recently at software-as-a-service company GoTo and several other tech companies, and his direction could reinvigorate DigitalOcean.', 'Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 24, making it inexpensive by just about any measure. As more enterprises turn to the cloud and AI, DigitalOcean appears well positioned to serve the massive base of SMBs, which could eventually take its stock much higher.', ""Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU) operates one of the world's largest digital banks, but you could be forgiven for overlooking it. While Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was an early investor, it only operates in Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, making Nu Holdings easy to miss."", 'Those who notice the company can also miss its value proposition. Unlike the U.S., Latin America is a region with few traditional banks. That left much of the population unable to get a bank account or credit card.', ""The company's Nubank has changed that, giving millions of Brazilians their first credit card. And since most Latin Americans have smartphones, the bank can interact with customers without having to maintain physical branches."", ""This approach has been so successful in Brazil that 88 million customers, or 53% of the country's adult population, have at least one Nu account. Also, with the bank saturating the market in Brazil, it has expanded to Mexico and Colombia, which account for around 6 million customers combined. Early signs of success in those countries indicate Nu's rapid expansion could continue for years."", 'Those increases led to $8 billion in revenue in 2023, a 68% increase from a year ago. And Nu Holdings recently turned profitable on an annual basis, earning $1 billion in net income after losing $365 million in 2022.', 'Investors have begun to take notice, and the stock is up more than 180% over the last year.', 'Nu Holdings is also priced attractively for new investors. At a P/E of 58 and a forward P/E of 31, the stock is inexpensive considering the rapid growth.

If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, you can go to 10 of the Largest Cities in the World by Population instead.\xa0', 'As of 2024, there are over 8 billion people in the world. According to the United Nations, this number will see an increase of almost 2 billion by 2050, and by the mid-2080s, it can go as high as 10.4 billion people. In the mid-twentieth century, the total world population was nearly three times less than the number at which it stands today. In other words, Earth was home to 2.5 billion people in 1950, and nearly 70 years later, it grew to 8 billion.\xa0', 'But what do these numbers really mean? The global population can sound like an abstract concept to many. So, to wrap your mind around the concept, think of a football stadium, like the Michigan Stadium. Officially, the stadium has the capacity to host a crowd of 107,601 people. Now, if you are one of the spectators at this stadium, and if all 107,601 people showed up, the seats would still be full. If there were a few thousand more spectators, it would be only slightly more congested. However, if you added another 100,000 more people, there would neither be any seats left nor any room for anyone to move, given that the ground is a no-go zone.', ""This addition of people beyond the capacity of the land is exactly what’s happening to the world right now, and why overpopulation is such an incredibly important issue. While the Earth is huge, its resources are slowly but surely running out. World Resources Institute estimates that food production will have to grow by 50% to sustain the global population by 2050. It might look easy on the surface -- that is until you realize that 40% of the land has become too degraded for agricultural production, and as the UN shows, 90% of the world's topsoil faces risk by 2050 due to unsustainable agricultural practices. You can read more on this in our piece on the 12 most advanced countries in agricultural technology."", 'While population growth is a global issue that needs to be carefully navigated, it is also an opportunity for some business owners. According to Michigan State University’s report on the subject, population growth is economic growth. So, whether it is a country or a city, a large population generally equates to an economically prosperous region. For example, in India — the world’s most populous country in 2024 — various multinational corporations have realized the potential of competing in the markets in India. These MNCs realize that the country has a high demand for goods and services, and they have a great opportunity to make profits out of it. Note that a country or a city with a large population not only provides a large consumer base but can also provide for an equally large workforce.', 'Some of the top leading multinational corporations, like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), have made huge investments in India for these very reasons.\xa0', 'Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), an American multinational technology company, debuted in India in June 2013.

In June 2023, the company announced to take its investment to $26 billion by 2030 across verticals.', ""Similarly, in 2020, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also committed to invest around $10 billion through equity investments and tie-ups in India over the next five to seven years. Last year, in June, Alphabet Inc.

Recently, the CEO of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Satya Nadella, announced plans to invest in training 2 million people with artificial intelligence (AI) skills in the country by 2025. While the country offers a large consumer base, it has also become a leading hub for technology, attracting significant investments by these technology companies.', '30 of the largest cities in the world by population', 'For our list of the 30 largest cities in the world by population, we have considered the cities with a population of 500,000 or above.

It’s ‘just not very good at retailing,’ analyst says",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walgreens-frail-quarter-goes-beyond-205438289.html,1711745678,STORY,['WBA'],"['Pharmacy chain Walgreens posted better-than-expected earnings on Thursday, but analysts are not confident in its ability to recover from a challenging few years of decreasing demand for COVID vaccines and treatments and increased retail competition.', 'Walgreens beat earnings estimates, posting a 6.3% sales leap year over year to $37.1 billion, as well as a 3.4% earnings per share bump of $1.20. But the rest of the report tells the story of a more fragile company: It reported a $13.2 billion operating loss—$12.4 billion of which was a noncash impairment charge, or write-off related to its primary care provider, VillageMD, which plans to shut down 160 unprofitable locations. The losses prompted Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, to call the earnings period “another torrid quarter.”', '“While these things are technical adjustments, they underline the poor strategic decisions Walgreens has made over the past few years and its various misadventures in health care,” Saunders wrote in a Thursday note. “With the focus of the business firmly on driving profitability under a new CEO, Walgreens has had to take a very big step back from operations that it used to see as central to its future.”', 'Walgreens anticipated some of its struggles, particularly including an earnings hit from its February sale of $992 million in shares of wholesale drug company Cencora, which pushed the company to lower the top end of its full-year adjusted earnings per share from $3.50 to $3.35. The company hopes to save $1 billion over the course of the year. CEO Tim Wentworth—who took Walgreens’ helm last October after a tumultuous period of staff walkouts over poor working conditions—instead attributes Walgreens’ future challenges to the retail side of the business, which has struggled because of consumers’ unwillingness to buy discretionary items.', 'Walgreens reported 4.7% sales growth on the pharmaceutical side of the business owing to rising inflation and drug costs, but a 4.5% total sales decline on the retail side. Deloitte’s March ConsumerSignals report indicates that discretionary spending intentions are still below overall spending intentions, which have ebbed and flowed since recovery from the pandemic.', '“We count on folks to come in and to not only visit our pharmacies, but come in, buy impulse items, get last-minute items, get seasonal items,” Wentworth told Bloomberg TV on Thursday. “A lot of those things are purchases that you have to get the value equation right on or else they feel discretionary to folks.”', 'Competitor CVS is having similar struggles. It, too, announced scale backs on primary care initiatives last fall after rising drug prices and a lessened demand for pandemic treatments slowed store traffic. Bankrupt Rite Aid, another drugstore chain, also closed a combined 1,500 stores. Plus, a weak respiratory illness season meant fewer people were buying tissues and over-the-counter medicine.', 'To be sure, Walgreens has taken bigger swings to attract cash-strapped customers. A Walgreens spokesperson told Fortune that the chain is “responding to these market dynamics by making investments in key value items, and focusing our capabilities to engage with customers in a very targeted way.” Walgreens introduced 37 new store-brand products last quarter and is using stockkeeping unit rationalization to determine which products are more appealing to consumers.', 'While customers are buying general merchandise at Walgreens for convenience, they are going elsewhere to find bargains, Saunders said. Walgreens has particularly been losing out in the beauty sector, where customers are willing to spend more money, but are turning to competitors like Target and Ulta, which offer larger selections and lower prices. Walgreens isn’t lagging in retail sales because of shoppers unwilling to spend money, Saunders asserted. It is losing money because consumers are going elsewhere for better deals and products.', '“Basically, Walgreens is losing out because it is just not very good at retailing,” he said.', 'But Wentworth doubled down on the importance of brick-and-mortar Walgreens, saying on Thursday that its customer service is what separates it from e-commerce giants like Amazon.', '“We will beat Amazon because of the human interface that we offer in communities and neighborhoods,” he told CNBC.', 'Saunders told Fortune, however, that Walgreens is not known for its customer service, and because customers frequent Walgreens out of convenience, they often don’t require high levels of help.', '“Walgreens’ view that this is an area of strength for the chain is a case of wishful thinking,” Saunders said.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with WBA.', ""Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA), a leading retail pharmacy chain, recently filed its 10-Q on March 28, 2024, revealing a multifaceted financial profile. The filing underscores the company's efforts to navigate a challenging market environment, marked by transformational cost management charges, legal settlements, and adjustments to equity earnings. Despite these hurdles, WBA's strategic initiatives in healthcare services and retail innovation suggest a forward-looking approach aimed at long-term growth. However, the company must contend with the volatility of derivative instruments and the impact of legal proceedings on its financial health. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as disclosed in the latest SEC filing, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of WBA's current position and future prospects."", ""Extensive Retail Network and Brand Recognition: Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) boasts an expansive retail presence, with over 8,500 locations ensuring that nearly three-quarters of Americans live within five miles of a Walgreens store. This extensive network is a testament to the company's strong brand recognition and accessibility, which are crucial assets in the competitive retail pharmacy landscape. The brand's strength is further reinforced by its significant share of the U.S. prescription drug market, accounting for 20% of total prescription revenue. WBA's ability to generate consistent foot traffic and customer loyalty through its retail outlets is a formidable strength that underpins its market position."", ""Diversified Revenue Streams: WBA's diversified business model, which includes prescription drug sales, general wellness products, European drug wholesale, and healthcare services, provides multiple revenue streams that mitigate the risks associated with market fluctuations in any single segment. The company's own branded merchandise and the integration of additional services like Health Corner and Village Medical enhance the customer experience and create an omnichannel presence. This diversification not only stabilizes WBA's financial performance but also offers cross-selling opportunities that can drive growth."", ""Restructuring Costs and Legal Settlements: The company's financials reflect significant restructuring costs associated with its Transformational Cost Management Program, which, while not indicative of current operating performance, do impact the bottom line. Additionally, WBA has faced substantial legal settlements, particularly related to opioid litigation and pricing disputes, which have necessitated considerable financial accruals. These non-operational expenses have the potential to divert resources away from strategic investments and innovation, thereby hindering WBA's competitive edge and financial agility."", ""Goodwill Impairment and Inventory Valuation Challenges: WBA recognized impairment charges related to goodwill, intangibles, and long-lived assets, particularly within the VillageMD reporting unit. These charges, which are not part of the ordinary course of business, can skew the perception of the company's financial health. Furthermore, the use of the LIFO method for inventory accounting in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment introduces variability in cost of sales, which can be affected by external factors beyond the company's control, potentially leading to financial statement volatility."", ""Healthcare Services Expansion: WBA's strategic investments in healthcare, including its majority stake in VillageMD and partnerships with Shields and CareCentrix, position the company to capitalize on the growing demand for value-based care and integrated healthcare services. The expansion of its healthcare segment aligns with industry trends towards personalized, technology-enabled care delivery, offering WBA the opportunity to differentiate itself and capture new revenue sources in the evolving healthcare landscape."", ""Omnichannel Retailing and Digital Transformation: The company's focus on creating an omnichannel experience for patients, through both digital and physical channels, is timely as consumer preferences shift towards convenience and online accessibility. WBA's efforts to enhance its digital capabilities and integrate them with its extensive retail network can attract a broader customer base, improve patient engagement, and drive sales across multiple platforms."", ""Legal and Regulatory Risks: WBA operates in a highly regulated industry and faces ongoing legal challenges, including those related to opioid dispensing and pricing practices. The outcomes of such proceedings can result in significant financial penalties and reputational damage, posing a threat to the company's operational stability and profitability. Moreover, changes in healthcare laws and regulations could impose additional compliance costs or alter the competitive landscape, impacting WBA's strategic positioning."", ""Market Volatility and Competitive Pressures: The company's financial performance is subject to market volatility, particularly in relation to derivative instruments used as economic hedges. Such volatility can lead to unpredictable gains or losses that do not reflect WBA's operational performance. Additionally, the retail pharmacy sector is highly competitive, with pressure from both traditional competitors and emerging online players. WBA must continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its market share and profitability in the face of these competitive threats."", 'In conclusion, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) presents a SWOT profile characterized by a robust retail network and diversified business model, offset by financial challenges stemming from restructuring costs and legal settlements. Opportunities for growth in healthcare services and digital retailing are promising, yet the company must navigate legal risks and market volatility to realize its strategic potential. As WBA continues to adapt to industry trends and consumer demands, its ability to leverage its strengths and address its weaknesses will be critical to its success in the competitive landscape.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Wentworth', ""Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. WBA's second quarter operational results were in line with our expectations despite continued challenges in the U.S. retail environment. Adjusted EPS of $1.20 reflects good execution and cost discipline in our U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment, continued strong performance in International, our first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA in U.S. Healthcare and positive impacts from tax planning benefits.During the quarter, we recognized a $5.8 billion after-tax noncash goodwill impairment charge, net of noncontrolling interest, related to our investment in VillageMD. This charge is excluded from any of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings measures. We are narrowing full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $3.20 to $3.35. This guidance reflects a challenging retail environment in the U.S. and our decisions to both wind down the sale-leaseback program and to sell additional shares of Cencora in a further effort to simplify our financial reporting.We expect these impacts to be partially offset by execution in Pharmacy Services and tax favorability. We have recently solidified our leadership team, which I believe has the capabilities and commitment to best lead WBA into its future. Once again, I'm excited to welcome our newest WBA leaders who were announced this quarter: Elizabeth Burger as Chief Human Resources Officer; Lanesha Minnix as Chief Legal Officer; and Mary Langowski as President of U.S. Healthcare. They join Manmohan Mahajan, who was confirmed as our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Leonard, who was named our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer in rounding out our Executive Committee.Together, our executive committee is comprised of individuals that bring an established track record of operational excellence and are all based together in Chicago, working to drive collaboration and acting with urgency to drive results. Over the next 3 months, we will continue the intense review of our portfolio of assets in an effort to ensure that each contributes to the growth we aspire to deliver and drives our go-forward strategy to be the leading retail pharmacy and health services partner that creates deep relationships and trust. Let me share further detail on the progress happening across our businesses to date. In our U.S. Retail Pharmacy business, we are navigating a challenging backdrop and exploring innovative pathways to boost profitability and growth. Within retail, our U.S. customer is confronting considerable pressure from multiyear inflationary trends and depleted household savings with U.S. household debt at record levels and delinquency rates on the rise. Our shopper is making deliberate choices to seek value resulting in channel shifting behavior. We're responding to these market dynamics by making investments in key value items and focusing our capabilities to engage with customers in an intelligent, targeted way. Additionally, we have implemented initiatives to improve front-end performance. We are leaning into the massive and timely opportunity to increase own brand penetration now standing at 17.1%, up 95 basis points year-over-year. We expect that we can further expand with a meaningful margin advantage over national brands. We plan to deepen our partnership with a reduced set of national suppliers, carefully selecting who we work with alongside our own brands. Operationally, we're intensely focused on the customer experience and meeting customers where, when and how they want to shop. That means enhancing the experience not only in-store but ordering online for pickup in-store and also same-day delivery, where over 80% of orders are received in less than an hour. Additionally, we are empowering our store managers and field leaders to share in our company's anticipated growth and increase their ability to impact areas that matter most to their stores and their customers. To do this, we are realigning incentives in an effort to place much greater weight on individual store performance. Moving to Pharmacy. We delivered another quarter of strong execution with outperformance in pharmacy services led by our vaccines portfolio. While market growth was slower than originally anticipated, we maintained market share. Our 11 micro fulfillment centers currently support 4,600 stores, which is over half our footprint. Earlier this year, we talked about pausing the rollout of additional micro-fulfillment centers as we work to optimize the model that gives our pharmacists and technicians the ability to spend more time on customer-facing activities and less time on core dispensing. We're seeing benefits such as improved NPS scores, patient retention and adherence. Not only is this better for the patient, it improves team member retention and talent acquisition as they perform more of the clinical activities that they are so well trained to do. We are focused on creating an environment that makes us the practice setting of choice for pharmacists. In fact, earlier this month, we kicked off our first Dean's Advisory Council meeting with the mission of reenergizing and evolving the definition of community pharmacy as demand for pharmacy services increases while the industry faces a pronounced labor shortage. We are on a mission to achieve provider status for our pharmacists given their influence which was so clearly highlighted during the pandemic. This would allow them to be reimbursed for providing select health care services to patients. These are highly trained clinical professionals just 5 miles or less for most Americans, whose scope of practice goes well beyond dispensing medications and includes immunizations, patient counseling and point-of-care testing for infectious diseases. As an example of what is ultimately possible, in the U.K., the NHS Pharmacy First Service, which launched on January 31, expands the role of Boots pharmacists throughout England to advise and prescribe for the treatment of 7 common health conditions. This model serves as a use case of new ways to fully deploy pharmacists' capabilities to lighten the burden on the broader health care system. Speaking of value, there is real opportunity for change and transparency in reimbursement models to help slow the inflationary pressures on drug prices and our patient's wallets. We already operate in the number of cost-plus and other alternative reimbursement models very successfully and welcome any model that reimburses us for the unmatched value we provide patients. We are having more active and constructive conversations with PBMs and other payers around cost-plus models. Many of these discussions are still in early stages, but they share a general theme. There is value to all from a transparent, predictable model where what patients pay at the counter is rationally tied to the cost of the drug. We don't expect an industry shift to happen overnight as there are a number of dynamics that need to be worked out, but it's especially encouraging to see PBMs and payers open to these models. Now turning to U.S. Healthcare. We have reached an important milestone delivering our first ever quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA and another quarter of significant year-on-year growth. Shields continues to deliver strong top and bottom line performance as their differentiated model is driving significant value for health system partners, which has resulted in several recent long-term extensions. VillageMD's actions to accelerate profitability, including recent rightsizing of their cost structure, optimizing their clinic footprint and growing patient panels, are driving improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Full-risk lives grew by 19% year-on-year in the second quarter. As Village prioritizes density in their highest opportunity markets, they decided in January to exit a total of approximately 160 clinics inclusive of the 60 that had been previously communicated. As of today, they have already exited 140 locations. Manmohan will discuss in more detail our recent reevaluation of our investment in VillageMD. Shifting to International. The business once again performed well, demonstrating strong and consistent execution highlighted by meaningful retail comp growth at Boots UK and a 12th successive quarter of market share gains. Finally, let me offer further detail on the progress of our swift actions to rightsize the WBA cost structure and increase cash flow across the company. We have a very high degree of visibility into the $1 billion in cost savings this year as actions already taken to date will account for a significant majority of the total. We're driving savings primarily in our U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment in 3 ways: organizational initiatives, including support office workforce reductions, location optimization, and additional pharmacy and retail operating model improvements. We are also working to improve cash flow by prioritizing projects and capital spend. In the first half, CapEx was $250 million lower than the prior year period. We are on track to deliver a $600 million reduction for the full year and $500 million in working capital benefits in fiscal 2024. Next, I'd like to introduce Mary Langowski, to say a few words. She will then hand it over to Manmohan to review our financial results in further detail."", 'Mary Langowski', ""Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone. I'm excited to join you all today, and I'm thrilled to be a part of this iconic company. I've spent 25 years in the health care, government and retail sectors. My career is focused on leading teams to unlock new areas of growth, commercialize new products and health care services and accelerate execution through financial discipline. I've been fortunate to have worked with some of the most successful Fortune 50 and health care growth companies that have sought to embrace and drive change to improve the health care system. At CVS Health, I led and executed a strategy to expand health care services, leveraging the company's core assets, including leading aspects of CVS' acquisition of Aetna. Most recently, I was CEO of Solera Health, a leading digital health technology company serving payers and employers, where I led a transformation of the business, launching new condition product lines, a new technology platform and a new economic model to support sustained growth. My vantage point of working across providers, pharma, payers and retail has made one thing clear. Very few companies have the platform access and reach of Walgreens. Since the announcement, I have heard from health plans, health systems and others who see an opportunity to partner with Walgreens. They know the value of our community presence, the role our pharmacists can play and the need for higher touch, more frequent and lower-cost engagement to drive better health outcomes. Health care is changing and consumer expectations are changing. In the face of that, we believe Walgreens is still the best position to be the most convenient entry point into the health care system. And our position as an independent partner able to work with any health plan or PBM is a true strength that we will capitalize on. Finally, I want to congratulate the team on achieving positive adjusted EBITDA in U.S. Healthcare this quarter. It's a significant milestone, and we will continue to build on this progress to drive value for our shareholders, customers and patients. Thanks to Tim and the Board for this opportunity. I'll now turn it to Manmohan."", 'Manmohan Mahajan', ""Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Overall, second quarter operational results were in line with our expectations. Sales grew 5.7% on a constant currency basis. U.S. Retail Pharmacy increased 4.7%, International was up 3.2% and U.S. Healthcare delivered pro forma sales growth of 14%. Adjusted EPS of $1.20 increased year-over-year by 2.8% on a constant currency basis, reflecting improved profitability in our U.S. Healthcare segment, impact of cost savings, and a lower adjusted effective tax rate, offset by the lower U.S. retail performance and lower sale leaseback gains. The lower adjusted effective tax rate reflects the initial recognition of a deferred tax asset in certain international jurisdictions. GAAP net loss for the second quarter included a $5.8 billion noncash impairment charge related to Village MD goodwill. During the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, we disclosed that our annual goodwill impairment test for our Village MD reporting unit resulted in its fair value exceeding its carrying value by a narrow margin. As a result, we have been closely monitoring the performance of the business for potential indicators of impairment. In February, we received a downward revised longer-term forecast from Village MD management, including the impact of closing approximately 160 clinics, inclusive of the 60 previously communicated slower-than-expected trends in patient panel growth and multi-specialty productivity and recent changes in Medicare reimbursement models. These impacts were partly offset by actions taken in an attempt to rightsize the cost structure. Given this revised forecast, we performed an interim test of VillageMD reporting unit goodwill that resulted in a fair value below its carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a $12.4 billion noncash goodwill impairment charge prior to the attribution of loss to noncontrolling interests. On an after-tax basis and net of 47% noncontrolling interest, this resulted in a net loss of $5.8 billion in the quarter. And this charge is excluded from non-GAAP earnings measures. The fair value of the business was determined using a combination of the income and market approaches. The impairment charge is due to the lower than previously expected longer-term financial performance expectations, challenged market multiples for Village MD's peer group, which have continued to decline and increased discount rates. As a reminder, our share of VillageMD's net assets carrying value also included a $2 billion gain recognized on the equity interest owned by the company immediately prior to the acquisition of majority equity interest in Village MD during the first quarter of fiscal '22. This goodwill write-off is noncash, and we do not believe it will have a significant impact on our financial position or our ability to invest across businesses going forward. During the first half of fiscal '24, we have seen positive financial impacts from the recent actions taken by Village MD management team to accelerate profitability. We believe the focused approach on improving performance in core markets as well as rightsizing the cost structure will provide VillageMD a platform for future growth. The second quarter also included a $455 million noncash impairment charge related to certain long-lived assets in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment. As part of a deep-dive exercise over the last several months, we concluded during the quarter that instead of continuing to build a new technology platform for pharmacy operations in the U.S., it would be better to modernize our existing system over time with new capabilities in an agile and capital-efficient manner with much lower disruption risk. As a result, we recognized the charge against the underlying software and development assets. Finally, similar to last quarter, we recognized a $474 million gain on the sale of Cencora shares, partly offset by a $396 million after-tax noncash charge for fair value adjustments on variable prepaid forward derivatives related to Cencora shares. Now let's move on to the first half highlights. Sales increased 7.2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EPS declined 20.5% on a constant currency basis due to softer U.S. retail performance and lower sale leaseback gains, partly offset by improved profitability in U.S. Healthcare and a lower adjusted effective tax rate. GAAP net loss was $6 billion compared to a loss of $3 billion in the first half of fiscal '23. As I explained earlier, the first half of fiscal '24 included certain noncash impairment charges. The prior year period included a $5.4 billion after-tax charge for opioid-related claims and lawsuits partly offset by a $1.4 billion after-tax gain on the sale of Cencora shares. Now let me cover U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment. Note that all comparable figures are on a leap year adjusted basis for all segments. Sales grew 4.7% year-on-year driven by brand inflation in pharmacy prescription volume and a higher contribution from pharmacy services, which was partly offset by a 4.5% decline in the retail business. AOI declined 29.5% versus the prior year quarter due to lower retail sales volume, elevated levels of shrink and lower sale leaseback gains, partially offset by continued progress on cost savings initiatives. Looking ahead, we are winding down the sale leaseback program, and we do not anticipate any material benefit going forward. Sale leaseback gains, net of incremental rent expense, were an approximately $125 million headwind to AOI in the quarter. Let me now turn to U.S. pharmacy. Pharmacy comp sales increased 8.7%, mainly driven by brand inflation, volume growth and contribution from pharmacy services. Comp scripts grew 2.9%, excluding immunizations, in line with the overall prescription market. The ongoing impact of Medicaid redeterminations continued to negatively impact overall market growth. Pharmacy Services performed better than expectations, driven by our vaccines portfolio. Pharmacy adjusted gross profit was down slightly versus the prior year quarter with margin negatively impacted by brand mix impacts and reimbursement pressure net of procurement savings. Turning next to our U.S. Retail business. We continue to see a challenging retail environment with a shift in discretionary spend away from the drug channel as consumers seek value. Comparable retail sales declined 4.3% in the quarter. There were 3 main drivers. First, as consumers continue to pull back on discretionary spending, we saw an impact of approximately 170 basis points from weaker sales in holiday seasonal and general merchandise categories. Second, as expected, we saw a weaker than normal respiratory season, which directly impacted comparable sales by approximately 90 basis points. Third-party data showed flu, cold and respiratory activity was down 6% compared to the prior year quarter. In addition, as cough, cold, flu serves as a primary trip driver, there was also an incremental impact from the lower attachment sales. Lastly, weather conditions in January led to a headwind of approximately 40 basis points in the quarter. Retail gross margin declined year-on-year, impacted by higher shrink partly offset by benefits from category performance improvement program. Turning next to the International segment. And as always, I will talk in constant currency numbers. The International segment again exceeded our expectations in the quarter. Total sales grew 3.2% with Boots UK increasing 3% and Germany wholesale up 5.3%. Segment adjusted gross profit increased by 3.2%. Adjusted operating income was down 32%, entirely due to lapping the real estate gains in the year ago period with underlying growth offsetting inflationary pressures. Let's now cover Boots UK in detail. Comp pharmacy sales were up 1.7%. Comp retail sales increased 5.9% and with all categories showing growth, led by beauty and personal care. Across formats, destination health and beauty, flagship and travel locations performed particularly well. Boots.com sales increased 16.8% year-on-year and represented over 17% of our U.K. retail sales. Turning next to U.S. Healthcare. The U.S. Healthcare segment delivered its first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. This was the third consecutive quarter of significant year-on-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter sales of $2.2 billion increased 33% compared to the prior year quarter, aided by the acquisition of Summit Health. On a pro forma basis, segment sales increased 14%. Village MD sales of $1.6 billion grew 20% on a pro forma basis. The year-on-year increase was driven by same clinic performance and growth in full-risk lives. Shields sales were up 13% as new health system contracts and expansion of existing partnerships led to an over 40% increase in the number of patients on service in the quarter versus the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $17 million, an improvement of $127 million compared to last year, mainly driven by Village MD and Shields. We believe VillageMD continues to make progress to accelerate profitability by rightsizing its cost structure and growing its patient panel. Shields saw robust adjusted EBITDA growth compared to the prior year period. Turning next to cash flow. Operating cash flows in the first half of fiscal '24 was negatively impacted by roughly $700 million in payments related to legal matters, $380 million entity premium contributions related to Boots' pension plan and underlying seasonality. Capital expenditures declined by $250 million versus the first half of fiscal '23. As a result, free cash flow was down by approximately $2 billion versus the prior year. We expect second half free cash flow improvement compared to the first half driven by several factors. First, we expect lower payments related to legal matters in the second half of fiscal '24. Second, we remain on track to reduce capital expenditure by approximately $600 million year-over-year. Third, we expect to deliver working capital improvement of $500 million during fiscal '24. While we did see some benefit of these initiatives during the first half of '24, we expect the majority of these benefits will impact the second half. Lastly, similar to prior years, we believe the underlying working capital seasonality in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and International segments will have a favorable impact on the second half of the year compared to the first half. I will now turn to guidance. We are narrowing our fiscal '24 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.20 to $3.35. The updated range incorporates a challenging U.S. retail environment, lower sale leaseback gains and reduced Cencora equity income, offset by the execution in pharmacy services and a lower adjusted effective tax rate. On the tailwinds, we continue to see strong execution in our pharmacy services business, which has delivered results ahead of our initial plan to date. In addition, we now expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be under 5%. On the headwinds, we expect the challenging retail backdrop will continue to negatively impact our U.S. retail sales in the short term. We now expect fiscal '24 retail comp sales to be down approximately 3%. Second, with the early wind down of the sale-leaseback program, no material gains are expected in the future. Third, the block sale of Cencora shares in February will reduce equity earnings going forward. Lastly, as discussed with the first quarter results, we forecast slightly lower market growth in U.S. pharmacy business compared to our initial guidance. Importantly, based on the progress made in the U.S. Healthcare segment through the first half, we continue to expect segment adjusted EBITDA to be breakeven at the midpoint of the guidance range. This represents an increase of $325 million to $425 million over fiscal '23. Next, I will provide additional details on the factors impacting earnings in the second half. In the second half, we will be lapping adjusted EPS of $1.66 in prior year period. We expect several key factors to impact the year-over-year comparison. First, the wind down of the sale-leaseback program is expected to be a significant headwind in the second half. Second, we will lap incentive accruals reduction in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal '23. Third, our updated guidance implies a higher tax rate over the remainder of the year. The U.S. Healthcare segment remains on track to achieve $165 million of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA improvement in the second half based on the midpoint of the guidance range. And finally, within our U.S. Retail Pharmacy business, we expect year-on-year improvement in the second half driven by cost savings initiatives. With that, let me now pass it back to Tim for his closing remarks."", 'Timothy C. Wentworth', ""To wrap up, we have hard work ahead of us in our journey to simplify and strengthen WBA, but we are encouraged by our progress. This team has a clear mandate to act with everything on the table to put our business on the right track. We are well positioned to drive capital-efficient growth rooted in our retail pharmacy footprint and build out an asset-light health services strategy to deliver care for communities and create value for partners. We've kicked off our strategic planning work. Over the next 3 to 6 months, this team is undergoing an in-depth analysis to determine the actions necessary to achieve what we believe will be the optimal portfolio with a focus on maximizing growth potential and generating cash flow. We are reviewing every business through a longer-term lens focused on strategic fit, synergy potential, financial upside and new or complementary capabilities. We are taking a thoughtful approach fueled by a sense of urgency to finding opportunities to unlock value or validate existing pathways. In my 5 months with WBA, I have been most impressed with our 330,000 team members' commitment to our company. In my experience, it's very hard to get that. That pride is foundational to our future growth, ability to consistently execute and create sustainable long-term shareholder value. That dedication also gives me and our team great confidence in our future. Now I would like to open the line for questions. Operator?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.', 'Lisa Christine Gill', ""I have a multipart question. I just really want to start with your comments where you talked about boosting profit and growth. You talked about new reimbursement models. You talked about provider status. So you talked about a lot of different things that you think can come into play. Can you maybe just talk about your line of sight and timing to get there? Would be the first part.And then secondly, I want to say welcome to Mary. Mary, as we think about the profitability and we think about capitation and the commitment of Village in the capitated markets, the comments were made today around the number of closings now, 140 locations closed. Can you maybe just talk about what you see as the future of capitation? And then putting that all together, I just really want to understand how to think about the progression going into '25. Tim, I know you have a big strategic review coming. I know you're not ready to give guidance on '25. But are there kind of some building blocks to think about when we think about the progression of the back half of '24 going into '25?"", 'Timothy C. Wentworth', ""Thanks, Lisa. A lot there. So I'll take the first part and probably have Rick Gates add a little color. We'll have Mary take your few questions, then Manmohan go ahead and talk about the back half of the year into '25. In terms of new reimbursement models, growth, et cetera, et cetera. Clearly, as we said I think last quarter, we're now just coming into the '25 conversations that are more structured with payers, particularly PBMs as it relates to reimbursement. And what I would say, which is what I've said in my prepared remarks as well, is we are having very constructive conversations as well as ad hoc conversations with certain payers which continue to lead me to believe and our team to have confidence that there are multiple ways for us to create value for payers and that the pressures on reimbursement -- that there's a clear acknowledgment, let me say it that way, that just playing the way we've been playing for the last 25 years is not going to work. And I think everyone acknowledges that in the conversation of how we help the PBMs win in their marketplaces with this drive to higher transparency, more member friendliness and so forth, really actually aligns us quite well in those conversations. I don't know, Rick, if you want to take -- add any color to those conversations, your team is obviously very close to them."", 'Rick Gates', ""Yes. Lisa, this is Rick. And I'll just add, we are just in earnest starting up the calendar year '25 negotiations. But I will say you also talked about some of the expanded services. We have gotten traction not only on our adherence based programs and our performance against those to continue to get more adherence based contracts going forward. Vaccines have been a very strong part of what we're doing. But we're working very closely in the selling cycle right now when it comes to testing, test and treat as we expand those opportunities across the country as well, and that's a state-by-state really process that we're going through until there's a federal provider status, which Tim talked about in his remarks."", 'Timothy C. Wentworth', ""And then -- and thanks, Rick. So bottom line, Lisa, in this area, we're realistic. We know that the longer-term structural changes that are very likely to occur will take multiple years, and we're prepared -- we're also working with our distributor to reconfigure the way that we work with them to ensure that we are, again, making sure that the value that flows to us as well as through us is what it should be. Mary, I'll let you just briefly comment on Lisa's second question."", 'Mary Langowski', ""Thanks, Lisa. I'll just say -- reiterate what I said in my opening remarks, that payers and health systems are approaching us and are very interested in working with Walgreens to help them drive MedEx savings. We've got unmatched assets in the marketplace given our reach with consumers, and that's something that a lot of the traditional players in the health system don't have. So we'll be working with them and having conversations in the coming months."", 'Timothy C. Wentworth', ""We had some of those underway. I expect them to accelerate meaningfully with Mary's arrival. And by the way, this is an appropriate time for me to also thank John Driscoll. In my prepared remarks, I did not do that. And of course, John actually helped me find and recruit Mary. John did a lot of terrific work during his time here at WBA. I look forward to continuing to work with him in a different role as an adviser through the end of the year. So thank you to John. And then finally, Manmohan, I'm sure Lisa is not the only one with the question as it relates to the second half. And so you take that."", 'Manmohan Mahajan', ""Sure, Tim. So Lisa, this is Manmohan. As you think about the building blocks for '25, let me start by saying, we're not providing FY '25 guidance on this call. As you heard in Tim's prepared remarks, we are working through a strategic review with the executive team in place now and a detailed 3-year plan. And so we will share that input over the next 3 to 6 months.But let me share some themes as you think about the second half and as you think about '25. In terms of second half, a couple of things to point out that I think are obvious and you understand. One is we do not expect any meaningful contributions from sale leaseback in the second half. And so it's pretty clean in terms of not including any sale leaseback gains from that perspective.And second is the lower adjusted effective tax rate, the timing of that played out for us in the second quarter. And so we do expect a much more normalized tax rate in the second half. Now as you think about bridging into '25, a couple of things to consider. First, U.S. Healthcare growth, you see that we're maintaining our guidance on adjusted EBITDA which is at the midpoint of the range, $375 million increase year-over-year in fiscal '24. And so we do see, as we look ahead into '25, we do see growth continuing in healthcare. Village, we expect to continue to drive growth as they focus on the core markets as well as continue on their cost actions that they are going through this year. So that's one part. Shields obviously continues to grow throughout the year, and we do expect them to continue to grow into fiscal '25. Second, cost savings, the actions we have taken in the first half will have a ramp-up effect in the second half. We're not done yet. We continue to make decisions to rightsize our cost structure here at WBA. And so we do expect a wraparound effect of that into fiscal '25. Third, retail business in the U.S., as I shared in my prepared remarks, we have seen headwinds persisting for longer than expected in the U.S. retail environment. And we have lowered our expectation for the second half or for the full year fiscal '24 to a negative 3% comp. Now within that, we do expect slight improvement over time in the second half as the actions that Tracey and the team are taking will take hold and will drive certain level of improvement. So you have to think about what that is going to be into '25.And then maybe the last piece on this is our business does have some seasonality. And so pharmacy services business, which has really performed strong throughout the first half, that does generate significantly higher contributions in the first half compared to the second half of the year. Cough, cold, flu season does have both impact on our pharmacy business in the U.S. as well as on the retail business in the U.S. and the timing of that on a more normalized basis does play out more in the first half than in the second half. And lastly, just on the seasonality piece, another example is Boots, which does have higher contributions in holiday seasons in the first half. So you got to factor those. I just want to make sure you have those themes."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen.', 'Charles Rhyee', ""I wanted to drill down a little bit more on the retail segment, U.S. retail here. Tim, you talked about a number of things, right, trying to increase own brand, realign around a number of national brands as well. Maybe can you talk about how quickly some of those can be implemented here, particularly as you think about realigning around fewer national brands, like how long would that process take? And then you mentioned that vaccines has been leading in the pharmacy services part of the business. Is there any way you can give us a sense on when we look at U.S. retail AOI maybe not quantitatively, but qualitatively to a sense of how you would split the contribution between, let's say, pharma services, traditional front end and pharmacy?"", 'Timothy C. Wentworth', ""Thanks, Charles. To your second question, we're not prepared today to break that out. Obviously, we build from that. And I think over time, we're going to be looking to give you incremental visibility to key operating metrics that would help you model some of that out. What I can tell you is the vaccine and test and treat and so forth portfolio is very meaningful in terms of our overall back of the store reimbursements and our growth.If you think about it, it's actually quite amazing, 5 to 10 years ago and let's go 10 years ago, pharma had pretty much abandoned vaccines on a large-scale basis. A lot of the companies had moved away. There was not a strong, strong incremental demand. Today, we see it as one of the key areas of innovation inside pharma companies. And the exciting part for us that is underappreciated is that in every case, those companies look to their core ability to get to patients as being able to leverage what we do at Walgreens and what our industry does. And we have a unique position in that the conversations I have with the CEOs of major pharma companies that are driving these innovations suggest to me that, that model where we're paid fairly for the work that we do at the back of the store is a model that the future not only needs, but it's going to reward our shareholders. As it relates to U.S. retail, I'll turn it over to Tracey other than to say -- that is one of a number of key areas for us, the idea of SKU rationalization alongside of growing private label. I think you've got to look at both of those things, and we are moving rapidly on a lot of things. We announced last week a change in store manager compensation for 2024. Initially, that was thought it needed until '25 to get it right, and we found a way to get it done now so that we could unleash the energy of our key field-based leadership in our stores. And so what I've seen is our ability -- and we saw it during COVID, our ability to execute quickly when we've got a goal, when we've got a clear ability to create value is something that I've actually been pleasantly surprised by since I've joined the company. And Tracy has been leading the -- along with -- I've terrorized a few national brands myself in a few meetings lately, in terms of saying that we're looking for partners, and we aren't going to be a partner to everybody. We want somebody that is going to be everything to us rather than something for everyone. So with that, Tracey, do you want to give a little color on the whole national brand strategy?"", 'Tracey D. Brown', ""Yes. Good morning, Charles. Yes. So as it relates to our own brand expansion, as Tim has indicated, we have been accelerating this at a rapid pace. And if you've been tracking, our own brand penetration has been growing quite nicely. To your question around how quickly, there are some things that we can do very quickly. One of those, again, Tim mentioned around embracing and incentivizing our frontline team members to really showcase their own brand products and what is important to the consumers in their market.The second is, in terms of store reach and shelf depth, we can move on those quite quickly. And then the third area is around new product innovation. And this is the part that actually takes a little bit longer. But just to give you a little bit of color, we launched 37 new products in Q2. And what this means for us is as the consumers' behavior continue to focus on looking at value and finding own brand and being willing to lean into own brand, this is working out quite nicely for us. We are feeling quite good about the level of depth that we can go with own brands."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.', 'Eric R. Percher', ""I appreciate the commentary on pharmacy services and reimbursement model. So a follow-up for Tim and Rick. It's interesting to hear you call out looking beyond payer and PBM to the manufacturers and this core ability to get to patients. I'd love to get your updated view on LillyDirect. And if the goal is to expand access, does it make sense to include retail, do you view it possible to have direct relationships given PBM contracts? Any perspective there would be appreciated."", 'Timothy C. Wentworth', ""Sure. Thanks. I'll start and turn it over to Rick. First of all, I would prefer that Dave and the Lilly team talk about their strategy. But that being said, first of all, I'd point out we have a direct relationship with literally every American. And it may not be in their funded benefit in all cases, but they come into our stores for a lot of other things. And so I love where we start when it comes to looking at programs where pharma companies may want to go direct to patients for a particular product where the normal supply chain reimbursement model, et cetera, isn't working effectively. I think if you look at the GLP-1s, for example, the adherence on those drugs over a reasonable periods of time is not what I believe anybody would hope for. Not the patients, not the payers to the extent that that's a paid-for product and certainly not the innovators. And so we are uniquely positioned to be a partner. It's one thing to have a distribution partner. It's another thing to have a clinically aligned partner that can actually help a patient work their way through safely because I believe the companies that made these products also want to ensure that they retain a high safety profile. Otherwise, there will be other issues downstream, which are not what anybody would want. So we think we are a natural partner for those things. And Rick, I'll let you add any color there, but -- from our perspective, again, our ability to work on a product basis, direct with pharma is unencumbered by any of our other relationships. Rick?"", 'Rick Gates', ""Yes. The only thing I'd add is you said we have relationships with every consumer who walks into our store, we have a relationship with every pharma company. And I think what they see with us is that we are a natural partner. We roll up our sleeves. We help them solve what they're really trying to solve for. And I think that's a natural place for us to fit because we are an independent provider. If you think about it that way, we don't have any other assets vertically integrated. And so I think we're a natural partner for them. And I think they see us as a willing partner to help them really drive programs in the market."", 'Eric R. Percher', 'Was this what drove the comment on your distributor relationship profile changing?', 'Timothy C. Wentworth', ""No, really nothing to add. I mean we've had a long-standing relationship with Cencora. I did prior in another life. And that relationship has always got to be organic and dynamic because the market changes. And while a long-term relationship is a great context into which to operate, it's important that as well, we sit down as we do with Cencora and look at not only where is it working, but where might it work a bit better, and more importantly, over the next 3 years, where are the changes in the marketplace likely to manifest, and how do we make sure that we retain a contemporary and a competitive situation as it relates to our cost structure, as it relates to the services that we receive, as it relates to the things that we can provide as a good partner. So all of those things are things that we throw on the table. And I look forward to working with how my team does with Bob in his new role, I congratulate Steve, who had a terrific run there and was a great partner for me over a lot of years, but again, you can't just sit still, and we're not going to."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.', 'Kevin Caliendo', ""I wanted to talk about the sort of second half guidance and what it implies as we think about the headwinds and tailwinds from that base into fiscal '25. So if we take that sort of midpoint, $1.42, there's no sale leasebacks there. Presumably, tax would be a headwind? Or would it sort of be -- I guess what I'm asking like some headwinds and tailwinds from that base, whether it's tax, we understand core is probably going to be a headwind, maybe 340B?And then the second question that I have above and beyond taking that run rate is, was there any effect from the changes in PBM reimbursement, like the timing for the retail segment because of DIR fees going away, meaning did it change the cadence at all or impact the cash flows at all?"", 'Manmohan Mahajan', ""Yes. Let me take the guidance first, and then Rick can talk about DIR a little bit more. So from a guidance perspective, as you think about the midpoint of the range you're calculating in the second half and thinking about '25, the first, on the tax rate side, we expect fairly normalized tax rate for the second half. We did have a significant benefit that we recognized in the second quarter and timing of that played out here. So that, I think, is -- there is no more headwind from taxes if that's your starting point for fiscal '25. And then, yes, as I said, I think a couple of themes to consider. First is U.S. Healthcare growth, significant growth expected. We're maintaining guidance in fiscal '24. And as we look out, we do see growth continuing, both at Shields as well as at Village as they concentrate on their core markets and continue to drive the cost down in the business. Our own cost savings initiatives. We've talked about $1 billion of cost savings in the year, and now we're on track to achieve that. And there are actions that we'll continue to take in the second half. And so you will see a wraparound benefit into '25 as well as the new initiatives that will continue on cost efficiency side. I talked about retail, negative 3% comp expected for the year as we thought about the second half guidance or second half implied guidance. And so we do see, however, it improving over time slightly. And so going into '25, the actions that Tracy just talked about and team is taking, they will take hold. And I think that we do expect some improvement in '25 for that. And then seasonality, I think you got to factor in as well. You talked about earlier in the call around vaccines portfolio. Obviously, there's seasonality there. Cold, cough, flu, there's seasonality there, and Boots there is seasonality there. So those are maybe some of the themes that you want to consider."", 'Rick Gates', ""Yes. And just to answer on the DIR fees and the impacts that we might be seeing there, outside of, obviously, cash flow, which obviously works its way out throughout the year. We really aren't seeing a negative impact on reimbursement. By and large, what we're seeing is that we're contracting for the rates that we were performing against either historically and/or even if there was a negative impact on reimbursement, we're signing pay-for-performance contracts that we have the ability to overperform on. So I would say that DIR fee has been really neutral to us when you look at it from a reimbursement perspective."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.', 'George Robert Hill', ""And I kind of have a couple of what I call kind of brief quick questions. First, for Rick, I guess I would ask, when we think about potential changes to the reimbursement model, you touched on this, I guess, could you talk about the push and pull a little bit on those discussions. Manmohan, I guess I would ask just if you could make a quick comment on earnings cadence between fiscal Q3 and Q4. And Tim, I know I'm throwing in a lot here, but just kind of an update on portfolio strategy. A lot of us look at the company and do some of the parts analysis -- there's an argument to be made that you're getting the core U.S. business for free, given the value of the other assets, kind of just want to know how you're thinking about the portfolio and how you unlock value."", 'Timothy C. Wentworth', ""Great. Thanks. I'll have Rick take the first part of your question, and then I'll have Manmohan take the second, and I'll take the third."", 'Rick Gates', ""George, thanks for the question. And the push pull when it comes to some of the reimbursement model changes, I would say we obviously work with PBMs hand in hand to understand what payers are looking for in a marketplace and the ecosystem. If, obviously, they're looking for a standard-based reimbursement model, it's an AWP-based model, we have those with them. If they're looking for cost-plus models or other types of reimbursement models, we work with them to make sure they have those solutions to go to payers that may be looking for it.So right now, I think it's an opportunity for us to continue to put different types of models in the market and then see what payer uptake really looks like and then really try to advance those models as we move forward."", 'Manmohan Mahajan', ""Yes. From a cadence perspective, I think what we're looking at here is fairly balanced here in third and fourth quarter. And then finally, the portfolio..."", 'Timothy C. Wentworth', ""Let me be real clear, because I don't think it was ambiguous, but we have been, over the last several months, digging deeply into the core business as well as every piece of our portfolio. Obviously, the big chunks you know what they are and what their brand names are and so forth. But also looking at our store footprint, looking at, as you heard before, our suppliers and our assortment, looking at manager compensation, looking at workflow design and pharmacies and working with deans as well as looking at our automation. And -- but when you step back to the large piece, to your sum of the parts question, obviously, we're very conscious of the fact we have about a half a dozen things that need to either fit, they need to synergize, they need to offer upside in a long-term runway for growth, either by themselves or perhaps combined with other things. They need to unlock capabilities that we would otherwise not be able to have unlocked or else we need to find a better place for them. And so from our perspective, I can tell you that, for example, Mary on the U.S. Healthcare side, which has its own collection of assets independent from Boots and Shields and CareCentrix and the businesses that you know that we have, Mary has been doing a complete strip down of every one of those businesses and looking at, is it staffed right, is it built for growth, do the market support growth. And this is going to culminate in part, and let me be really clear, I don't want to send a message that there's some big bang coming. But when we sit down with our Board at the end of April, we are going to give them outside in context about the forces in health care over the next 5 to 10 years. We're going to then look at how does that impact the people that we serve, both the payers, the health systems, the consumers, the patients, pharma companies, and then we're going to make a series of either recommendations or next steps so that the Board is very clear where we're headed in some things. We have some things already underway as part of this as we go from examining things to testing markets and so forth. I'm not going to get detailed at this point about that other than to say, again, it's dynamic, it is across the company, and I'm super excited to have a fully staffed executive committee based here in Chicago to do it alongside me."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with Leerink Partners.', 'Michael Aaron Cherny', ""So maybe along the lines of the push and pull between your previous guidance versus the updated guidance. Just a couple of things. First, on the dynamics behind the retail decline, I know you talked about same-store growth, but are you seeing any changes in what you're expecting on economics on a same-store script basis in the back half of the year? And then just on the healthcare AOI as well. I know you highlighted the strong EBITDA performance. I would have thought with the accelerated pace of VillageMD closures that you might see a better second half ramp. Is there any other puts and takes we should think about within the healthcare business that leads to the dynamics of your current expectations versus year-to-date performance?"", 'Timothy C. Wentworth', ""I'll have Manmohan take that."", 'Manmohan Mahajan', ""Yes, sure. So look, as you think about the second half implied guide, a couple of factors to consider. And I'll go through in order. Retail is the biggest factor from a second half perspective. We have seen the challenging environment continues to persist for longer than expected. And so we are lowering our expectation. I think we were at low single digits, now we're expecting negative 3% comp. So that is going into it.Our decision to early wind down the sale-leaseback program, as well as our decision to sell Cencora shares through block trade versus using a VPF structure, variable prepaid forward structure is creating additional headwinds as I think about the guidance we provided last quarter. So those are 3 headwinds. And the offset to that from a full year perspective is obviously one of the factors is the favorable tax rate we have in the year. Now the timing of that has played out in the second quarter. Now you had some specific questions on the script and how do we think about that. If you think about the second quarter, our comp script growth ex-immunization of 2.9%, fairly consistent with where market was, we're holding our share. And as we think about the second half of the year, we expect us to continue to grow in line with the market and hold the share. So that's kind of the expectation we have on the script side.On healthcare, Village continues to take decisions to rightsize their cost structure and think about their clinical footprint and they did make the decision to exit certain more locations. To us, we are very pleased with reaching the first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA in the segment. We want to be -- we want to take a prudent approach for the next half. And so therefore, we just continue to maintain the guidance we have."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call back over to Tim for any closing remarks."", 'Timothy C. Wentworth', ""Thank you, operator. And thank you for your questions and your time today. As we close, I just want to just quickly remind you what you've heard today. Our second quarter operational results were in line with our expectations despite continued challenges in the U.S. retail environment. We drove solid execution. I'm very, very proud of the team and cost discipline in our U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment with continued strong performance in International, and we had our first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA in U.S. Healthcare. Now driven by our recently solidified leadership team, I would remind all of you that there -- one member of the team actually is starting in 2 weeks. But basically, now we're all around the table.

If you want to skip our overview of the industrial sector, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Best Industrial Machinery Stocks to Invest in. ', 'The industrial machinery industry is one of the most capital intensive in the world. Setting up a firm that makes these machines is not an easy task, and it often requires years of expertise and hefty amounts of capital which until very recently were only available to sizeable nation states such as the United States and the Soviet Union.', 'Over the course of time, these companies, which often trace their roots back to the industrial boom in the U.S. during the second world war, have become private entities. At the same time, the high barriers of entry mean that not only are the top industrial machinery stocks among some of the most advanced companies in the world but also that these firms enjoy the comfort of economies of scale that are hard to compete with.', 'As an example, consider some of the most valuable industrial machinery stocks in terms of market capitalization. A couple of such firms are General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW), and Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN). General Electric, makes and sells some of the most advanced machines in the world. These include jet engines which are the backbone of the U.S. Air Force and nuclear reactors. These reactors are some of the most exacting engineered products on the planet due to the high stress environment in which they operate and the extreme catastrophe that awaits them should even the slightest thing go awry.', 'Similarly, Eaton plays an integral role in the global aviation supply chain. An average jet engine for a commercial airliner can contain as many as fifty thousand individual components, from high precision crystal fan blades to pipes, pumps, and hydraulic motors. All of these have to be kept in prime condition, and they are built to a standard that not many firms can achieve.', 'However, unlike high growth technology stocks, industrial machinery stocks are more down to Earth. Like their technology peers, their performance depends on interest rates since funding pricey manufacturing plants and other equipment requires loans. Similarly, the rosier the economic outlook is, the better industrial machinery stocks fare on the stock market since the demand for their products is assumed to be stable.', 'As an illustration of this aspect of industrial machinery stock performance, consider the shares of General Electric and Eaton. They bled as much as 51% of their share price value on the stock market after the coronavirus lockdowns were put into place, as investor outlook for the global economy darkened.', 'But what about recent stock performance? After all, investor expectations of an easing in interest rates could also generate tailwinds for industrial machinery stocks. 2024 has seen investors start off the year on an optimistic note for rate cuts, but settle with the knowledge that the Fed might take longer than they would like. Year to date, both GE and Eaton are up by 39% and 31%, respectively, with GE enjoying slightly higher returns in the wake of its announcement that it will split into two companies.', ""Analyzing industrial machinery stocks means that investors have to focus on their product portfolio and the potential to both reduce costs (often dubbed as 'improving margins') and gain market share. Both these themes were also present during the latest full hedge fund investor letter cycle which was for the fourth quarter of 2023."", 'For instance, Southeastern Asset Management mentioned General Electric in its investor letter for the period as it outlined:', 'General Electric - Industrial conglomerate General Electric (GE) was the top performer for the year. We exited this multi-year investment as its price went above our appraisal. In 1Q23, GE spun out GE Healthcare, which we sold as it traded at our value. The share price continued its strong performance throughout the spring and summer, and we ultimately sold the position in the third quarter when we no longer saw a margin of safety for the business. CEO Larry Culp was a great partner who created significant value for shareholders by reducing leverage, cutting costs, streamlining operations, improving company culture and simplifying the structure with plans to split the company into three businesses. We hope to have the opportunity to partner with him again in the future.', 'Artisan Partners was more detailed in its coverage of Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) when it shared:', 'Xylem is a global leader in water technology across pumps, smart meters and treatment services. More than 80% of the company’s sales come from markets where it maintains the No. 1 or No. 2 market position. Xylem’s pumps business (selling primarily to utilities) is a sticky and profitable operation that provides capital to invest in more innovative solutions, such as smart meters. In mid-2023, Xylem completed the acquisition of Evoqua, giving it a leading position in the US water treatment business. We believe the company is at the start of a compelling profit cycle. Smart meter sales are recovering from supply chain issues, cost and revenue synergies from the acquisition are in the early innings, and a newly hired (and well- respected) CFO should help catalyze long-awaited margin expansion. Meanwhile, rising demand for solutions to water sustainability challenges should persist as a strong trend for years to come.', 'Seems like smart money is, like always, aware of broader trends that could be helping industrial machinery stocks set themselves up for years of growth. Consequently, we decided to take a look at some such stocks and the notable names were Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH).', 'A factory floor filled with specialized drug manufacturing machinery and workers.', 'Our Methodology', 'To make our list of the best industrial machinery stocks, we ranked the most valuable specialty industrial machinery and heavy machinery stocks by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023 and picked out the top stocks.', 'For these best industrial machinery stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q4 2023: 38 ', 'Otis Worldwide Corporation (NYSE:OTIS) is a large American special industrial machinery company headquartered in Farmington, Connecticut. It primarily makes and sells elevators. The firm scored a major win in March 2024, when it was awarded a ten year contract to service the Burj Khalifa.', ""During 2023's fourth quarter, 38 out of the 933 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey had bought Otis Worldwide Corporation (NYSE:OTIS)'s shares.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 85% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).', 'Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.', ""Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Sysco."", ' View our latest analysis for Sysco ', 'Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.', ""We can see that Sysco does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Sysco's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters."", ""Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Sysco. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.6% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.8% and 5.3% of the stock."", 'A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 23 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.', ""Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily."", 'The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.', 'I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.', 'Our information suggests that Sysco Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$66m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. ', 'With a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Sysco. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.', 'While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

If you want to skip our coverage of the global food industry and recent events, then you can check out 5 Biggest Food Companies in the World by Revenue. ', 'Just like the oil industry, the food industry is another sector that is quite crucial to global economic well being. Over the course of time, advances in transportation have ensured that the global food industry is an intermix of products shipped all over the world, a fact that makes it quite vulnerable as the world witnessed in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Since both countries are key global suppliers of commodities such as grain and wheat, their conflict made food prices surge all over as investors worried about supply chain shocks.', 'Similarly, advances in production and agriculture technology also mean that as countries such as India are able to utilize their natural advances for mass producing commodities such as sugar and rice, they are also able to influence global food prices as was evident last year in the rice industry after India banned its rice exports. For more details about the rice industry, you can check out Top 20 Rice Producing Countries In The World.', 'Since then, the global food industry and food prices have somewhat stabilized particularly after record interest rate hiking sprees by central banks. As opposed to high growth stock market sectors such as technology, food companies and food company stocks are more stable and do not entice investors who are chasing lucrative share price appreciations Their stability comes from the fact that food company stocks benefit from stable demand for their products even during an economic downturn. As a whole, these stocks are dubbed as consumer staples and you can find out more about them by reading 14 Best Consumer Staples Stocks To Buy Now.', 'Building on this, 2023 and 2024 have been marked by a renewed investor focus on technology stocks, with artificial intelligence companies such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in particular attracting billions of dollars in capital. At the same time, this continuing popularity and utility of technology has also continued to affect the global food industry. For instance, the food industry is known for controversial products such as palm oil and the impact they have on global greenhouse gas emissions. On this front, a British startup focusing on manufacturing oils and fat sustainably scored a win in March 2024 when it secured €2.9 million in investments.', ""One particular area of the food industry that has been creating quite a bit of buzz these days is the cocoa industry. One of the hottest food raw materials over the past couple of years has been cocoa. Cocoa is used to make chocolate, and recent price movements in this commodity have meant that investing in cocoa might have been better for those fortunate to have done so than buying NVIDIA's shares before the start of the late 2022 - early 2023 AI wave on Wall Street. May cocoa futures crossed a whopping $10,000 per ton in March 2024, to mark a whopping 246% gain over the past twelve months. The reason cocoa prices are high is because there are supply disruptions in the production hub of Africa, with multiple analysts expecting that global cocoa supply will shrink over the next year or so."", 'So, as the food industry continues to be quite dynamic despite being a stable sector, we decided to look at the biggest food companies in the world.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system."", 'Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors.

The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it.

If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, you can go directly to the top 6 States with Highest Female to Male Ratio in the US.\xa0', 'Since the mid-1960s, there have been more males than females in the world. If we look at more recent years, in 202 the UN World Population Prospects 2022 Revision reported, there were around 44 million more males than females in the global population. In the same report, the UN also predicted that the worldwide sex ratio will even out by the year 2050, and in the years that follow, females will start outnumbering men.\xa0', 'Gender ratios are not even anywhere in the world. In fact, throughout global history, they have been skewed in different regions, and across the globe, for several reasons. For example, in the past, sex-selective abortions and female infanticide were common practices almost everywhere.\xa0 Resultantly, there were more young boys than girls. The practice is still common in some countries and regions, which serves as a contributing factor to the gender ratio being skewed in those places. Another example of gender skewing came from the pandemic. The Brookings Institution reported that during COVID-19, more men died than women did. Gender inequality, pregnancies, mortality rates, and sex ratios at birth are other factors that contribute to this globally.', 'According to UN estimates, the countries with the best male-to-female ratio include Qatar, UAE, and Bahrain. The male-to-female ratio in these countries stands at 266, 228, and 164 males per 100 females respectively. The Pew Research Center, in its analysis of the UN’s World Population Prospects 2022 Revision, suggests that the ratio is imbalanced due to the high rates of job-motivated migration to all three of these countries. For example, Qatar’s population comprised 79% foreign people in 2019, and 83% of these were males, which is why,\xa0 the country ended up having more males than females.', 'If we look at the United States, according to the Census data, the country has had more females than males since 1946. The UN predicts that by 2050, the population sex ratio is expected to stand at 99 males per 100 females. Today, females make up 50.4% of the country’s overall population of 334,914,895. According to the Census 2021 (most recent) data, there were about 168 million women in the United States and 164 million males. Note that this does not mean that the gender ratio is equal between all states and cities in America. Like with every other country, the gender ratio is skewed in this one as well, with Alaska having the lowest female-to-male ratio (88.57 females per 100 males).', ""Gender discrimination is still a major obstacle that women have to tackle every day in the States, and in the world at large. Recently, the conversation about the topic was sparked – and the gender bias in today's world was well-demonstrated – through Mattel Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT)’s first live-action film, Barbie. America Ferrera’s monologue within the movie especially gained popularity and helped shed light on the issue in a direct manner; speaking of how every woman is expected to live up to society’s unfair and unjust expectations in all aspects of life, including corporate.\xa0"", 'Following the release of the movie, Mattel Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT)’s Q3 sales jumped up to 16%. As these results were announced, Mattel’s CEO and Chairman, CEO Ynon Kreiz said that these results had benefited from the success of the movie, which became a global cultural phenomenon. He further expanded that the movie, a powerful marketing tool, and social commentary, marked a “key milestone” for Mattel Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT). In Q4, however, Mattel did not perform well – if interested, you can also read: Here’s Why Mattel (MAT) Fell in Q4.', 'Data from UN Women shows that when women work, economies receive a significant boost in terms of economic diversification, increased workforce, and shared success. Their data also suggests that if the gender gap is closed, the global economy could receive a boost of a whopping 7 trillion USD.\xa0 Fortunately, the world is progressing in this regard, too. Today, apart from Mattel, several other companies take the importance of women in society, and the economy, into consideration. For example,\xa0 Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.B) are among the most prominent Fortune 500 companies with a high female-to-male ratio in their workforces.', 'Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), is one of the leading tech companies that have employed the highest percentage of women in their workforces.

According to its 2022 report, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN)’s workforce in the US comprised 49.7% of women. Globally, this percentage was slightly less — but still more, standing at 46.9%. In the company’s 2023 review of compensation, which included base pay, cash bonuses, and stock, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) found that women in the US employed by Amazon earned “99.9 cents for every dollar men earned performing the same jobs.”', 'Similarly, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

According to its most recent report, which was published in 2021, Berkshire Hathaway, and all its subsidiaries, had a total of 14,260 females meaning, women made up 32% of the company’s entire workforce. Note that the other half is not entirely made of men, but also underrepresented folks. Besides its inclusion of women in the workforce, Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

You don’t care so much about the market’s short-term ups and downs anymore.”', 'Despite being the underdogs in the stock market last year, analysts and seasoned investors have retained their interest in dividend stocks. Janus Henderson predicts the total dividend payments for 2024 will reach $1.72 trillion, showing a nearly 4% growth on a headline basis from last year, which translates to underlying growth of 5%. Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, commented on dividend growth in 2024. Here is what he said:', '“For 2024, the dollar aggregate of dividends is expected to increase once again. Absent an economic or geopolitical event, S&P 500 large caps appear to be weathering volatility better, as the index is expected to post its 15th consecutive year of dividend increases. In addition, the index is also expected to log its 13th consecutive record year, with a 4.5% - 5% increase in payments for 2024, compared to its 5.1% increase in 2023 and its 10.8% increase in 2022.”', 'Though some of the best dividend stocks like The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

But we're kicking off with real estate news, Matt, after several years and lawsuits related to excessive fees and antitrust activity, we might be looking at a new real estate market."", ""Matt Argersinger: We might be, Dylan, if you ever sold a home. It's always been confounding well, at least for me, that in addition to paying a commission to your agent, in that case, the seller's agent or the listing agent, you'd also have to pay a 2.5, 3% commission to the buyer's agent. And this was essentially, for decades, a mandate of the National Association of Realtors, NAR, of which the vast majority of agents in the US are members of. It's why commissions on transacting home haven't traditionally been set in this 5-6% range, split evenly, usually by the seller's agent and the buyer's agent."", ""So instantaneously on every transaction, in addition to other closing costs, repair expenses, 5-6% of your homes' equity would instantly, that had been built up maybe for over many years, and worth tens of thousands of dollars would instantly go away for these commissions. It always seemed like one of the final areas of the market that had yet to be disrupted. Because if you think about what's happened to travel agents, what's happened to brokerage commissions, certainly transacting and almost everything in the country has gotten cheaper overtime except transacting a house."", ""If you look at the median price of a home in the US, right around $400,000, that's 20,000 or more in commissions just to sell a house. But here we are. The NAR has essentially settled, which means they are not contesting any more of these lawsuits, the civil action suits against them, they're paying a fee and the idea is that they're going to lose their monopoly position on the marketplace. Now, agents won't be required to be members of the NAR."", ""They won't be forced, for example, to subscribe to MLS listings already get paid and essentially makes real estate agents, free agents that can set their own commissions. And if you're a home seller, or a homebuyer, gives you far more negotiating power. You can pay a commission to a buyer that you want to pay, and it's no longer causing a mandate to pay a commission to the other side of the transaction."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, and looking at this news, I was trying to process both the news itself and then the follow-on impact that it would have. And I feel like for buyers and sellers, we're probably looking at lower fees and a little bit more flexibility. Beyond that in the business landscape of real estate, I feel like it's really hard to nail down what it means for companies like Zillow, Redfin, and other operators."", ""Matt Argersinger: I think clearly for the publicly traded agencies, this is not going to be great news. I mean, those fees are coming down, their margins have to come down. The business is going to change. There's going to be less agents in the marketplace. For companies like Redfin and Zillow, it is a little cloudy for me, because for one, Redfin who has already trying to disrupt the whole transaction fee of this marketplace anyway and with Zillow, Zillow really depends on the vast majority of its revenue still comes from agents who pays a low for leads on their marketplace."", ""They need agents, and they depend on the traditional model. So for Zillow, it's also could be disruptive, although a little confusing. I would just say this, good real estate agents do deserve to get paid. I don't want to make it seem like these commissions were being paid out the door for nothing. I mean, many work really hard. I've worked with agents that had been great. They spent a lot of time working with buyers or sellers, and they deal with a lot of paperwork. There's a lot of value to what they do. So I feel like it's still, in a way, it makes the marketplace better for them because I think good agents will thrive. Good agents will still get paid. A lot of agents who were just living off these richly undeserved agent commissions will not thrive."", ""Dylan Lewis: This week we've also got updates in AI sending tech companies in two different directions. We're going to kick off looking at Adobe here, Andy. Company reported earlier this week, results were good, but it seems like the guidance and the general outlook on how AI might be affecting the business has the market concerned."", ""Andy Cross: Yeah. Dylan, it's like that Damocles hanging over Adobe. AI is just waiting for that string to catch, to end up doing some serious damage to this company. This is a company that's been in investing in AI for a long time. Their Firefly solution, since its launch, now has more than 6.5 billion images created. They're investing in this space, and they talk a lot about this. However, even though that quarter was really quite good, revenues up 11%, adjusted earnings per share up 18%. They didn't have to pay a billion-dollar fee for the Figma transaction getting canceled. Their digital media revenue was up 12%."", ""Their ending annual recurring revenue, which is very important when you think about this business, up 14%. The Document Cloud business, which is part of their solutions and part of this package, was up 23%. So that's really impressive. Their digital experience revenue, that's their new marketing business they've been growing. That was up 10% with remaining performance obligations up 16%. So the quarter was all really positive, very good. However, it was all in the conversation about the guide in their future revenues, thinking about the bookings and how artificial intelligence is or is not impacting their business."", ""Especially it's things like OpenAI Sora, which is their text to video creating device and how much that's impacting, not just creating videos and imaging, but also giving clients the ability to edit those. Lots of conversations around what that means for their business. They didn't come out very enthusiastic about the guide going forward. Lots of conversations around with the analysts about what this means after minutia at the timings at this quarter, next quarter, a lot of concerns that so much of the growth of the year is going to be back-ended into the second half."", ""Clearly you see the stock reacting, more down 13% as we're going into tape this. The market clearly having some discussions and some hesitations about Adobe, which is the leader in this space. By the way, the stock has done very well over the last year. So I think the most pullback maybe a little ahead of itself and this is some of the pullback we're seeing."", ""Dylan Lewis: A different story with AI over at Oracle. This is a company that is catching the tailwinds of AI. Matt shares up 10% this week following the company's fiscal Q3 report. Thanks in large part to demand for the company's Cloud offerings."", ""Matt Argersinger: Absolutely. I mean, if you look at the headlines, revenue up 7%, adjusted EPS up 16%, both better-than-expected, but the two likely reasons, and you hit one of them, the stock has been up so much. First Oracle's remaining performance obligation, RPO, Andy mentioned this for Adobe as well. This is basically sales that Oracle is contractually obligated to fulfill, but hasn't yet quite recognize as revenue or if you're a simple investor like me, it's called backlog."", ""That's up to 80 billion, up 29% year over year. So that's just revenue growth is going to continue to be fairly robust going forward for Oracle. But the Cloud revenue for Oracle, 25% year over year, Cloud infrastructure business, 49% increase year over year. That's the piece that really competes with the bigger at Cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft's Azure."", ""You can conclude right there that Oracle is gaining market share. The big reason for that is a CEOs Safra Catz, demand for Oracle's Artificial Intelligence Cloud capabilities far exceeding supply. To address this, Oracle actually signed a new agreement with Nvidia in the quarter, investing heavily in opening and expanding its data center network. The AI plug in here for Oracle is very real and very robust, and it's got investors really excited about the business, obviously."", 'Dylan Lewis: Matt, right there, you name checked a lot of the big companies and brands that we associate with cloud discussion, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon. We have generally left Oracle out of the conversation for the big Cloud players, do you feel like we need to start bringing them into that group?', ""Matt Argersinger: I think so. This might eventually become a big four with Oracle. Because if you think on Oracle, all the other three companies that you mentioned all have big leads, big market shares, but they're also doing very different things in a lot of different markets. Amazon in particular, Alphabet of course, with advertising and YouTube. This is Oracle's business. I mean, database networking Cloud infrastructure is their business. It's their focus. I think they're going to continue to gain market share."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break over at Under Armour, it's meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis joined in studio with Matt Argersinger and Andy Cross. We've got a rundown on retail and apparel. We're going to start things off with Williams-Sonoma, a huge week for them, Andy, shares up 18% following the company's earnings release. Even though net income declined year over year and revenue was basically flat. Andy, what's going on here?"", ""Andy Cross: Well, on the earnings per share, because they buy back so much stock, it was actually up a little bit just 3%, but far ahead of analysts' estimates and the sales were down 7%. Again ahead of estimates was much better than how management had guided. Laura Alber has been leading Williams-Sonoma for so many years, so successfully years. I think very conservative when she thinks about running this company, she and her team. Been talking about the challenging market."", ""We're having comp sales down. Almost 7%, that was better than two years ago but worse than a year ago. The four-year company, you go back four years, Williams-Sonoma Lakes have focused on that pre-pandemic. They were up almost 30%. I mentioned the earnings per share, gross margins is where they won Dylan in this quarter. Higher merchandise margins, lower supply costs. Williams-Sonoma has been really effective at managing their supply costs."", ""Being very efficient as how they have taken out more and more costs from their supply chain, how the pricing is starting to impact that. They've been talking about that for the past year, which is one reason why their stock has done so well. That allows them to get more efficient when it comes at gross margin up at 46% versus 41% a year ago. The inventories were down 14%. Again, they're just managing this business, blocking and tackling very well."", ""Operating cash flow was up 60% for the year. But because they've been so efficient on their capital expenditure, free cash flow more than doubled, that allowed them to announce a 26% increase in the dividend certainly helps with the stock price performing so well. Even though comps really for the year where basically down across the board and for the quarter."", ""Dylan Lewis: Andy, this is probably not accompanying that a lot of people necessarily have on their radar and it is to their detriment. Shares up 140% over the last 12 months. It's been an incredible performer. The stock is currently at all-time highs for people that maybe haven't been following this business. Do you feel like the valuation is in a good spot or do you think it's getting a little rich?"", ""Andy Cross: Here's just some context behind that. I'm a fan of Williams-Sonoma and a shareholder and we've recommended the stock in lots of different spots here at The Motley Fool. The market cap is more than 18 billion. It sells at around an earnings multiple of around 20 times. Historically their earnings multiple is more in the low double-digits or call it the 12, 13, 15 times range. When it got so cheap, it got down to single digits, which is one reason why the stock has done so well. If you want to nibble, fine, don't go all rushing, but put it on your watchlist. Certainly, if you don't have it as one to keep an eye on."", 'Dylan Lewis: We have a less glamorous story going on over at Under Armour. News out this week that founder Kevin Plank will be stepping back into the CEO role and Matt, the market did not seem too excited about it.', ""Matt Argersinger: Not at all, Dylan. The stock sold off pretty hard. I think there's a few reasons for this, which we'll get into. One, it's interesting, the current or now former CEO, Stephanie Linnartz, she's only on the job for about a year and she was in the first year of what she thought was going to be a three-year turnaround for the business. Clearly, that turnaround is not happening to the satisfaction of the board and probably to a lot of investors."", ""But I just found that press release from Under Armour very short, very vague. I felt like this needed a letter from Kevin Plank saying why he's coming back, why he thinks it's important for him to step back into the CEO role. We didn't get that. We just got a pretty short press release. That's interesting. If you look at Under Armour stock, it's been stuck in the low single-digits for what seems like forever. Maybe there's a little bit of desperation here, but you have to remember how Plank left the CEO spot in 2019. Putting aside his various personal scandals, he didn't leave the company in exactly a great state."", ""Revenue growth had already flatlined for a few years, he made several poor acquisitions to try to digitize the brand. Inventory hadn't been managed well. They failed to gain traction at leisure market which I feel they basically invented it. Yet they see that to Lululemon and Nike and others. This isn't Steve Jobs coming back to the doors. This is not Howard Schultz coming in or Michael Dell coming back. A founder that's going to come back and lead the company to glory. I think that's why the market is taking a very cautious look here and saying this is a CEO with a pretty tumultuous tenure at the end. Coming back can a turnaround really happen now?"", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, I have not sold very many stocks that I've owned and when I have almost without exception, it has been the wrong decision. The exception to that is Under Armour. [laughs] I sold my shares, I think when it was in the mid-teens and this business has not managed to get back on track. It's down about 50% from then. Recently, shares are at their lowest level in almost a decade. What is the return to normal even look like for this business?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I don't know, Dylan. Unfortunately, I'm still a shareholder, and Under Armour withheld throughout. You see the stocks at a 10-year low. I looked at it. It's about a 17-year low in the stock price. But this is a situation where I step back and say, wait a second, how much worse can this actually get? Because if you look at Under Armour's stock, it's trading for about 0.6 times revenue. For comparison, Nike trades at three times revenue."", ""The stock's at a 17-year low. This is the kind that still generates healthy cash from operations. We were talking about before the show, that the brand has to have some equity value. That's probably greater or somewhere in the vicinity of three billion, which is its market cap. Maybe it can't get worse and just maybe Kevin Plank finds a little bit of that entrepreneurial magic he had early on in Under Armour. Three years from now, four years from now we're looking at Under Armour and it's $25 stock."", 'Andy Cross: Six dangerous words in an estimate. How much lower can this go? Just be mindful of that.', ""Dylan Lewis: You're pumping the brakes there a little bit there Andy."", 'Andy Cross: Be cautious there.', ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to wrap the company updates with a look at Ulta Andy, shares the cosmetic company down 5% after earnings. What's the story here?"", ""Andy Cross: It's interesting, the quarter was actually pretty good. It wasn't anything to really crow about. Revenues were up almost 10%. Earnings at $8.08 ahead of estimates so that was actually quite strong. Their comp sales were at 2.5% but that was versus 16% a year ago so a pretty good deceleration and a little bit lower than the estimates, which I think is what has the stock lower."", ""Transactions up 4.5% but pricing or average cost of the goods that someone buys down almost 2%. The gross margin was up a little bit. Lower shipping, better supply chain costs. Same thing was we sold Williams-Sonoma. I don't think quite as effective at Ulta, but a little bit better, but lower on the merchandise margin, which was different than what we saw at Williams-Sonoma. Sales gross and operating margin the cost down at 23.1% versus 23.6%."", ""They're doing a pretty good job of managing the cost that boosted the operating margin to 14.5% versus 13.9%. A lot of numbers there, but ultimately, they've done a pretty good job managing the cost in a relatively slower-growth business. Skincare up very much. One interesting little tidbit there. They talked about the sales for the makeup category decreased in low-single-digit range. They saw softness in prestige cosmetics was partially offset by growth in mass makeup. They pointed at Elf Beauty as one of the ones that are doing pretty well at Ulta."", ""Dylan Lewis: It's interesting. I haven't taken a look at the quarter, but I'm wondering if they said anything about shrink or anything like that, Andy. I don't know if you guys caught it, I only caught a little bit of it, but CNBC did this pretty large report this past week about retail theft. I can't remember the exact story, but I guess there was a ring of resellers who had stolen millions of dollars and Ulta is one of the big victims here of just ceiling this high-margin makeup, reselling it, pocketing the difference and I know they made some arrest. But it was a remarkable story."", ""Matt Argersinger: It was a huge enterprise, actually a criminal enterprise. Now I think this quarter didn't get nearly the tension as we've seen in the past. I think you'll see that they're starting to peak a little bit in there talking about shrink I think but it still continues to be an issue. The guidance, by the way, just very quickly is that comp sales at 4-5% versus 5.7%. That's for the full year guided ahead. Comp sales for this year ahead, not quite as good as last year."", ""Dylan Lewis: I'm glad you brought up the shrink story there, Matt because I remember looking at Target's results earlier this earnings season and I think it was two quarters ago, shrink was the narrative. They made that statement, I think it was a $500 million adjustment. Some of the numbers that they were looking out for the year saying that shrink was the culprit."", ""We didn't see a lot of headlines on that. We didn't see a lot of discussion of that with the most recent earnings release but we've actually dig into management's calls. It came up 12 times. It is still a story for some of these retailers and we're still hearing management talk about it but it seems like one of those things that has crested as a wave already when it comes to financials."", ""Matt Argersinger: When CNBC does a special report or in a special documentary and something that usually as Andy alluded to, it's looked at the peak but it might be one of those situations where hopefully companies are figuring it out and moving on."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt Argersinger, Andy Cross, fellows, we're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next, we dig into the turmoil at Paramount and the possible path forward for the entertainment giant. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Award season is over, but there's still plenty of drama unfolding in Hollywood. Motley Fool Money is Ricky Mulvey caught up with Bloomberg entertainment reporter Lucas Shaw for a look at the business of streaming, the power of incentives and corporate infighting at Paramount."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It's a tough time to be a movie company, but do you think there's starting to be a greater willingness to go for those singles and doubles now that there's some adult dramas that are doing poorly. Ferrari did not make money. But Anyone but You, which was a romantic comedy made more than 200 million at the box office. Like A24 eked out a profit with Iron Claw. So is that door continuing to open a little bit for those adult dramas that used to just go to streaming."", ""Lucas Shaw: I get very mixed signals on this and I think it's hard to answer that holistically. I don't think that these companies are giving up the Tentpole strategy, which is, let's have a handful of really expensive, really big movies. Because when those hit, they make so much money that it pays for everything else. They can't really move away from that for that reason. But you do see certain studios. I think Universal, Sony, and Warner Brothers, foremost among them making a wide range of movies, believing that there is value in having to use your metaphor, a single or a double, in addition to the home run."", ""If you look at the types of programming that Netflix is going to do, I think they are going to take fewer really big swings and make more movies. That cost in the 20-$100 million range, which is, I don't know that it's going to be a bunch of dramas. I think it's going to be comedy, and thriller, and action, and things like that. But I do think you'll see a good number of movies made that are in that middle that the big studios had really forsaken over the last several years."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, and I want to own a move to Paramount, which you covered in a story called How Paramount Became A Cautionary Tale Of The Streaming Wars. The only thing on their upcoming slate seems to be those big Tentpole films after the Bob Marley movie, and they did Mean Girls. But then upcoming it seems that it's a Transformers movie, they're going to do a PAW patrol movie and it's not these small movies. They might have trouble attracting creators right now to get those smaller to midsize movies for their studio."", ""Lucas Shaw: The problems at Paramount have made it very hard for that studio to do deals. I've spoken with executives there who've been very pleasantly surprised, I should say, at some of the talent who've reupped their relationships with the studio, including John Krasinski though, filmmaker of A Quiet Place. But you talked to a lot of producers and they're pretty clear that Paramount would be their last choice, both because it's a company that just hasn't made that many movies."", ""Other than basically Top Gun, hasn't delivered a lot of huge hits. But I think more than anything because of the uncertainty at the corporate level where you have a controlling shareholder in Shari Redstone who pretty clearly would like to sell the business, is looking for buyers, is struggling to find buyers. She's looking to exit, not because this is a great time to sell and you can get a great deal, but because the business has been declining and she wants to get out while she still can."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Can you take us into the informal auction going on for for Paramount right now. Where's that sit?"", ""Lucas Shaw: Actually, you know what? Let's let's take it back a step. I think Shari decided that she wanted to sell at some point last year. Some people say over the summer, some people say in the fall. Either way, she had been approached over the years by a few parties. She really started late last year talking to David Ellison, who runs a company called Skydance, whose father is Larry Ellison, one of the richest men in the world. David Ellison's company is a co-financier and producer of Top Gun, of the Mission Impossible movies, of Star Trek movies, all Paramount biggest franchises."", ""David Ellison would like to buy Shari Redstone out of National Amusements, which is the family holding company, a movie theater chain that has the stake in Paramount and then merge his company with Paramount. The challenge with this is that while that deal is great for Shari Redstone, it's not necessarily great for Paramount. I think there's some people who are skeptical about why you would want to merge with Skydance other than because David Ellison wants them to and there would certainly be a dispute over valuation."", ""So you've got Shari Redstone and her camp looking to see if there are other bidders. Because anytime you're trying to sell, you want to have multiple bidders so you can drive up the price. So she's talked to David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Brothers discovery. She's talked to Apollo, the private equity firm, and she's talked to some other potential buyers. At the same time, you've got the company of Paramount with advisors looking to see if there are other offers because they don't necessarily love this David Ellison idea."", ""That's the state of play. We know that David Ellison is interested and has at least made a preliminary offer. We know there have been conversations with a couple of other parties, but it's not clear that there is another tangible offer or real buyer on the table right now for the company. So it's an open question as to whether they're going to get a deal done."", 'Ricky Mulvey: In the past, Netflix was a part of the conversation. Warner Brothers discovery looked at it briefly.', ""Lucas Shaw: It should be noted. I should just on that point, that yes, Netflix has been part of the conversation, but Netflix was part of the conversation in so much as it wanted to buy just the studio, Paramount Pictures. I think there are a lot of entities that would be happy to buy just the studio because it's got a good library that they could exploit and film and television, it's got, honestly great real estate that lot in Hollywood alone is worth billions of dollars."", ""The problem is that if you're Shari Redstone and you don't want to sell just the studio because it's your most valuable asset. So then you're left with a bunch of stuff nobody wants. If you're a buyer, it's the stuff nobody wants. Like you don't necessarily want to take these declining cable networks. So it's going to be interesting to see Shari Redstone's probably going to have to sell at a discount to unload the stuff that nobody wants in order to unload the whole company."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It seems that there has been a little bit of pride when they've had offers on the table. BET was one of them where the deal is off by a billion dollars, so everybody walks away. Now Paramount may get to a point where there's no option other than the buyer that's willing to take on the company."", ""Lucas Shaw: Yeah. I mean, it's crazy that they almost sold. They could have sold BET, they could've sold Showtime. That would have raised enough money between the two of them. If they did the deals, they probably could've gotten 4.5-5 billion dollars, that would solved a lot of problems. They could have paid off a lot of debt. They could have funded a bunch of stuff for the streaming service and yeah, they just didn't want to do it."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Is the cardinal misstep that Paramount made with streaming, which is their main loser of money. Just that they were late to the party or were there other mistakes along the way?', ""Lucas Shaw: They were definitely late. But that was not the cardinal sin because every company was late and every company that went in is facing the same conundrum right now, whether it's Paramount, or Warner Brothers Discovery, or Disney, or in a lesser way, Comcast because there are more diversified enterprise. But entities that have a bunch of cable networks are just watching as they fall into the sea and their streaming service is not rising fast enough."", ""So should they have moved faster? Yes, Disney moved a little bit faster. Having a lot of the same problems. I think the issue is that this was always going to be painful and you have this incredibly lucrative business that was going away and entities that made a lot of money from that business were not going to rush to kill it. It's the the classic innovator's dilemma that people talk about. Netflix was able to come in as a new player and disrupt this business and none of the competition moved fast or move quickly enough to respond."", 'I do think that Paramount has made some specific missteps. I mean, you look at it and I should also say Paramount was hamstrung by the corporate infighting. There were two separate entities, CBS and Viacom, that the Redstones controlled. Shari Redstone had to spend many years fighting to cement family control over them in disputes with management of both companies, when she did actually put it together. That then took a while to make it happen. So there were a lot of hurdles to making it work. Then they spent a lot of money really quickly.', ""They didn't think about it. All these companies made the same mistake. They had to try to compress 15 years of Netflix's building into a short time frame and we can debate, is there any way in which that would have gone well? Or was it just a function of going late and I'm not sure the answer. I'm sure that there were sounder strategies with these companies. I also think that had they acted five-years earlier, there's no guarantee it would have worked."", ""Ricky Mulvey: On Paramount, Shari Redstone wants a buyer. What happens if Paramount doesn't find a buyer?"", ""Lucas Shaw: It's a good question. It's the one facing all of these enterprises. Then Shari faces a couple of options. She can stay the course and believe that we've suffered maximum pain right now and the streaming service is going to keep growing, or we're going to manage costs and we'll figure it out. I don't think Wall Street would be very happy to hear that because it isn't working right now. There's a strategy where they resort to selling individual pieces again or where they halt costs a bit more. Then there's a more dramatic one which some have proposed which I still don't see them doing."", ""But this notion of them becoming a pure arms dealer, which means that they shut down the streaming service and just be a studio and sell the others. But considering that that company makes basically all of its money from cable networks and to some extent from streaming. That's where most of the employees are. That would require, I should say, gutting the business. You'd fire 50-80% of the staff, which is why I see that is unlikely but she'll have to have to make some big changes if she cuts it because if they come out and say, they haven't officially said that they're for sale but if there was a bunch of coverage basically saying that the deal talks were over, their stocks is going to tank."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I think there's also an interesting angle on this with the power of incentives. I want to talk about David Zaslav in a sec, but in this case, there's an early misstep from the CEO, Philipe Dauman, this guy was making so much money in stock awards. He incentivized to boost the stock price and then in order to do so, he's buying back stock, which means they're not investing into content and growing the business for the long term."", ""Lucas Shaw: Philipe Dauman, really one of the worst media CEOs of the last 20-plus years, I would say. Maybe, ever. He took what was one of the most vibrant and great businesses, in Viacom, drove it into the ground. He didn't understand Netflix, he didn't understand YouTube and rather than invest a bunch of money in streaming, which he should've done because they had the networks that were most exposed. MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, they speak to young people so you could see the trends early. I"", 'nstead of investing in streaming, he just bought back a bunch of stock. He did whatever he could to prop up the share price and it was really destructive to the enterprise long term. All the mistakes that Shari Redstone and Bob Bakish may or may not have made Philipe made more. Sumner Redstone, who was in charge of the company at the time and was the was the owner, they deserve the largest share of the blame, no question.', ""Ricky Mulvey: I wonder if there's an incentive problem right now. If Warner Brothers discovery and you've talked about it on the town, where David Zaslav has compensation award tied to the free cash flow of the business. I was talking to one of our investment analysts, Tim Buyers earlier. Basically, that's an uncommon way to incentivize a CEO. Feel free to break down this theory but now you have HBO or the company that's essentially shelved movies, one of which recently was the Wiley Coyote vs Acme movie. You get a tax loss on that, which is going to boost. You get the immediate boost of free cash flow but then, you might be killing ideas, drawing away creators."", ""Lucas Shaw: It's a question of whether he's incentivized to just cut cost to make cash flow look good and get himself paid more rather than act in the best interest of the company. It's a tough press. I don't think that David Zaslav made free cash and the Board made free cash flow the most important metric for his pay just because they knew that they were going to cut costs. I think they wanted to set the target. We have all this debt and we need to save money to pay it off. How are we going to incentivize people to do that? We're going to incentivize them to generate free cash flow and that's what they did."", ""That being said, it's just a terrible look for this guy who's about to get paid a ton of money, even though their stock is in the toilet, nobody thinks the company is performing very well. By the way, that free cash flow being the metric for performance and how people are paid, that doesn't apply to most of the employees of that company. It mostly applies to David Zaslav and maybe the inner circle. They're really perverse incentives there."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Listeners, you can catch Lucas Shaw on X. He is @Lucas_Shaw. Coming up after the break, Andy Cross and Matt Argersinger return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Dylan Lewis: As always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis joined again by Matt Argersinger and Andy Cross. If you went all in on the Stanley tumbler craze, you're going to have to make room in your cupboard for another weird household item that has caught fire. Andy, grocer Trader Joe's began selling mini tote bags for $3 in March. They are now selling for hundreds of dollars online. What are you make of this new consumer craze?"", ""Andy Cross: How many is many on the per square inch of tote bags? This has got to be a record if they're really small. We just bought a Stanley for $35 at REI and those things are some serious piece of hardware. We're now part of the Stanley craze, I think we have two of them now at the house so I can understand that. If it's me, when I go to Trader Joe's, I buy a lot of stuff. I'm bringing tote bags, hanging them on my shoulder, pulling them out of my jackets. Minis are not helping me very much."", 'Dylan Lewis: I think you timed the market well on that. I think you got in on the tumblers slightly after the peak and maybe have a good cost basis there. Matt, what do you make of these consumer phrases?', ""Matt Argersinger: I can't speak to this. I'm a guy who takes brown bags run reused bags to the grocery store and reuses them so I have I can't believe people are paying $100 for tote bags. I cannot believe it."", ""Dylan Lewis: I'm just happy people are using reusable bags. That makes me happy."", 'Andy Cross: There you go.', ""Dylan Lewis: I'll take that. Let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question. Matt, you're up first this week, what are you looking at?"", ""Matt Argersinger: Weird special situation here, Equity Commonwealth, the ticker is EQC. Equity Commonwealth, it's a two billion dollar real estate investment trust with 2.2 billion in net cash. Do the math there. Yes, it's trading below the cash on its balance sheet. Now it does own four office buildings that are cash-flowing but materially they're a very small part of the story here. Management is essentially sitting on 2.2 billion in cash collecting 5% with treasuries, which is good but waiting to make a transformative investment for the business."", ""The problem is they've been sitting on their hands for quite a while now. Investors are starting to get a little impatient and now there's a hedge fund called Land and Buildings Investment Management, LLC. That's a mouthful them but they own 3% of EQC shares, and they've submitted a letter demanding that EQC actually liquidate the business because under their model, liquidating the business would actually result in a net asset value of about 20% above where EQC is trading in the public markets. We'll have to see if this gets any traction. But I think it's a fastening situation to watch over the next few months."", ""Dylan Lewis: Dan, a special situation with Equity Commonwealth. What's your question?"", ""Dan Boyd: A special situation is called for, it doesn't make any dang sense. I'm sorry, are you trying to sell us on cash or office buildings, Mattie?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I think cash but it sounds like I'm actually trying to sell Dan a tote bag from Trader Joe's Andy, you're going to be able to beat that? What's on your radar?"", ""Andy Cross: I got Landstar guys, LSTR, an asset-light logistics company that generates more than five billion in sales, market cap value almost seven billion more cash than debt. It's an asset-light business, so it doesn't really own a lot of the assets. It uses technology to help clients, which is more than 25,000 customers across 1,100 independent agents. Basically get our goods from point A to point Z. Mostly inter-modal trucking, van shipments but also some Aaron Freight."", ""They help make sense of all the logistics challenges to be able to get all our stuff from when we buy it to when we want to consume it. Now it's been a tough two years post-pandemic because we're not buying as much stuff. Inventories are going lower. Companies are trying to run down all those inventories. You're just not seeing the volumes come across their net worth. That's been a big hit to their sales and to their profits. But this is a very talented management team. They focus very heavily on returns on capital and free cash flow. Ultimately in a pretty good spot, I think for Landstar."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Landstar.', 'Dan Boyd: First off, absolutely gorgeous stock chart here for the maximum time since they came out in 1993, whatever, just up until the right you love to see it But this is one of those companies where you read about it and you got to read four paragraphs to figure out the day. Make technology or make programming to help people do trucking. Not crazy about this company.', ""Andy Cross: But that's the magic behind Dan. Two tough businesses this week, Dan, which one's going on your watchlist?"", ""Dan Boyd: Well, I'm not going with whatever Mattie said Come on.

They also discuss why formula 1's parent company is happy to have you forget the sports pre-2017 history, the evolution of Ferrari's mythology, and whether the timing of Netflix's Drive to Survive was a lucky punch or a stroke of genius."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Joshua, Jon, I have to say I was reading your book on a flight and there's a part of me where I'm like, I'm going to read 20 pages of this book, it's a book for work, fine. I ripped through this thing, I had so much fun reading the formula. I'm delighted that you are able to join us today. I can't probably label it like this, but I think it is a excellent and entertaining, prequel-ed to drive to survive if you're a fan of the show on Netflix. Thanks for joining us on Motley Fool Money."", 'Joshua Robinson: Thanks for having us.', 'Jonathan Clegg: Yeah, thank you.', 'Ricky Mulvey: One of the things you write, you say, basically, Formula 1 is perfectly happy for its fans to assume that the organization started in 2017. Either one of you, why is that?', ""Joshua Robinson: Well, I think there's a lot of it, much of the Liberty era of Formula 1 is about rebranding it, about representing it to the world as this very polished or a glitzy entertainment product. That's one reason it's happy to look past the pre-2017 history because that was often gritty, full of some unsavory characters. They were racing in places that sometimes involved dealing with the KGB for instance, we can get into that later with Bernie Ecclestone. That was also at a time when the reality of F1 often involved extreme levels of danger and tragedy. Liberty was happy to airbrush all of that and present to the world, hey, we have this thing, there's also on Netflix, it's a modern TV epic."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It's one of my favorite reality show, it's one of my favorite television shows. Let's hit it now. I got an outline, but I think if I were listening and I heard Bernie Ecclestone in KGB. Bernie Ecclestone, he was the supremo, he was the boss of Formula 1 for 40 years and in getting races done, he had plenty of successes with the European Circuit, getting the races to the Middle East. Some missteps in America that I want to get to, but he had some interesting dealings with the KGB. Can you tell our listeners about that?"", ""Joshua Robinson: Well, Bernie Ecclestone, first of all, is a former used car dealer who became a driver agent, eventually bought a team in the early '70s and realized that the product they were selling was not racing, it was a television product and they were in the TV rights business and the sponsorship business. He built up the business over the course of 40 years into a global series that was prepared to go anywhere and take pretty much anyone's dollar and so in the '70s and '80s, he got it in his head that he really wanted to race behind the iron curtain."", ""There were negotiations with Bridge NAV in the Soviet Union, eventually they had to settle for communist Hungary, where he says he was quite happy to deal with the KGB because as Bernie told me when I was sitting in his living room in Switzerland, they were straight shooters. He quite enjoyed that, as we were saying, he's one of those people who's been largely airbrushed from the pre-Netflix era of Formula 1."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Jon, you're nodding."", ""Jonathan Clegg: Yeah, when you talk about Liberty Media being very happy for people to believe that the series started in 2017, a large part of that is because it's pre-2017 history is inextricably tied to this small whitehead maniac named Bernie Ecclestone. They were other people who knew much less about him, the less that people knew about him the better, because he has enjoyed some rubbing shoulders with some unsavory characters and as a man of a few scruples."", 'Ricky Mulvey: There is a lot of controversy with Formula 1, one of the stories that your books dives into that I think has been maybe airbrushed from the official history is Crashgate. Either one of you, can you give our listeners the primer on Crashgate and how that controversy maybe changed Formula 1?', 'Jonathan Clegg: Crashgate was an episode that took place in 2008,at the Joshua, Miami.', 'Joshua Robinson: It was the Singapore Grand Prix.', ""Jonathan Clegg: Singapore Grand Prix, that's right. What had began like a perfectly regular Grand Prix was delayed for a safety car incident, that's when in F1 when when when someone crashes and the remnants of their car scattered over the circuit, they have to bring out what's called a safety car, which is like regular road car. The drivers all then have to do a couple of laps driving very slowly behind the safety car before the race can resume."", ""This particular safety guidance doesn't happen quite early in the race and at what turned out to be a very convenient time for Fernando Alonso who had qualified very low down in the high teens, and had just taken a pit stop, gotten some new tires on his car, and found himself after the safety car incidents at the front of the pack while the leading contenders had been moved to the back."", ""He then went on to win the race, which would have been perfectly reasonable, were it not for the fact that the car that crashed was his teammate's car and it ultimately emerged that his teammate had been ordered to drive into the wall at 100 miles an hour on purpose in order to rig the race for his teammate to win. This was something that came to light only after the race happened."", ""Although when we spoke to one of the team principals who was taking part in that race, he described Fernando Alonso's look on standing on the podium. Alonso had maybe a look of guilt. He's not enjoying the moment of a race when you normally expect drivers to pump their hands into the air to celebrate. Standing on the top step of the podium his only win of the season and he wore the somber look of a man who knew that he had to go to the top of the podium by nefarious means."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Or he's following the rules that McLaren set out which we can get to. But how did the investigators know that? Crashes happen all the time in Formula 1, people run into walls sometimes, but how do they know that this one was on purpose?"", ""Joshua Robinson: They were able to look at the telemetry on the car, which is the set of sensors that record almost like a black box on an airplane, everything that happens in the car. What they could tell is as he came into this corner and was heading for the wall, he didn't really lift off the gas and didn't apply the brakes in the way that any normal person would if they were about to crash so they were able to determine that it was intentional."", ""Subsequent interviews revealed that they had been planning this in quite an intricate way to be as far away from the cranes as possible from maximum and convenience and guarantee a safety car. In the process of all of this a Brazilian driver named Felipe Massa was denied a bunch of points because he got caught behind the pack in the big reshuffle and ultimately it cost him a world championship by one point. Since then he is suing in British court to be reinstated as the 2008 world champion and for about $80 million in prize money and lost income as someone who would've been a World Champion because he never got that title."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It's interesting to me were Formula 1 is a sport where at its surface, it's supposed to be a pure meritocracy in some ways because whoever is the fastest wins, but it's also a sport that's named after its rulebook in one where it's incredibly hard to find justice. One recent example of that, it would have been Ferrari at Las Vegas even this year or a driver hits a drain cover during qualifying, rips out the underside and ultimately the team is punished for it because they have to use new parts over a mistake that the track made. Because there's no flexibility within the rules of this sport except when it's fought about, like at the higher-levels there's very little unintentional understanding."", ""Jonathan Clegg: I think that's one of the great takeaways from the book is that, as you mentioned, this is a sport literally named after the rule book. The Formula applies to the technical specifications that each team has to use each year when they build these cars. Yet, the entire history of the sport is basically about people trying to break the rules and getting away with it. Even the most successful teams and the dynastic teams that we think of as dominating the sport at various points throughout F1, most of those successes were built on identifying gray areas and loopholes in the rule book and exploiting those to maximum advantage."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Was anyone actually fired for Crashgate?', 'Jonathan Clegg: They were banned from F1 for two years.', 'Joshua Robinson: Yeah, the Renault team was banned from F1 for two years and Flavio Briatore, who is the team principal was suspended.', ""Ricky Mulvey: We've mentioned Liberty Media. It's a company that last week it was reported that Warren Buffett increased his stake in. It's not quite as opaque as Bernie Ecclestone, but it's certainly one that shies away from the spotlight. What is Liberty Media?"", ""Joshua Robinson: It was the company started by Jon Malone, who is the telecoms and broadcast giant. It has its fingers in a lot of pies, but it's outside of Formula 1. It's got Live Nation, it owns the Atlanta Braves and it has a lot of quite diverse interests dating back to a vast cable network empire. It invested in Formula 1 because it wanted a truly global sports property that it's always undervalued and it had been held for a long time in-between the period of Bernie's total reign over F1. The business needed to be cleaned up and prepared for another sale and that was done by a private equity firm in London called CVC and they held onto it for about a decade before flipping it to Liberty Media."", 'Ricky Mulvey: When you talk about ownership of Formula 1 it confuses me. What do you own when you own Formula 1?', ""Joshua Robinson: It's a great question. You own what is often referred to as the commercial rights to F1. You are in control of the broadcast rights, in control of sponsorship, and in control of any kind of licensing. You don't own the circuits because those are done by local promoters, and you don't own the teams obviously because those were all privately held. You don't even own rules because that's done by the motorsport world governing body known as the FIA. You are the organizer and you own the commercial rights is a good way to put it."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Seems like a good business if you can get it. Another company that is very old company but it's really back on the come up is Ferrari right now. When we talk about branding, when we talk about marketing, I struggle to think of a company that's done a better job at this than Ferrari, actually maybe Red Bull. What were the ingredients? What created Ferrari's mythology where we think of it as this Premier Racing Car Champion?"", ""Joshua Robinson: One thing that's really amazing about Ferrari, and I think that even we didn't realize initially was how relatively young the company is. The first Ferrari's didn't roll off the line in Maranello until 1947. Enzo had been building cars at Alfa Romeo before then, but all he really wanted to do was race and so he was selling road cars to finance more racing, and what was incredible at the time is that right in this postwar period where people were starting to have disposable income again, he built cars that won critical races in front of just the right people."", ""Movie stars, and the crowned heads of Europe, and suddenly Ferrari took on this idea of glamour very quickly, and it also found a group of people to appreciate Ferrari and appreciate this old-world luxury at the right time and that was Americans. Americans loved Ferrari in the '50s and '60s and that contributed a huge amount to building up the mythology."", 'Ricky Mulvey: In many ways, Ferrari did not love Americans, and that maybe made the love grow a little bit.', ""Joshua Robinson: That was the secret of selling old-world luxury in the new world that Enzo understood which was, if you mistreat Americans and make them feel like they're not good enough for this, you will own them for life."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I think one rule that I learned about reading your book is how Enzo allowed Ferraris to be portrayed were there's a movie where they wanted to put Ferrari's and he basically said, you can kill a driver in one of my cars, but the car cannot lose a race, and I think that rule still might be in effect with the latest Ferrari movie that came out."", ""Jonathan Clegg: It's amazing how Ferrari has leveraged F1 to market itself around the world. When you think this is a company that has basically never really advertised, certainly not advertised on TV. F1 is its marketing and advertising arm and one of my favorite nuggets from the book is that the whole reason that when we think of an Italian sports car, we picture the red machine is because in the early days of F1, that was the color given to all Italian cars."", ""They used to have different colors for different nationality, so French cars would be blue, German cars would be white or silver, which is why we think of Mercedes as the silver arrows, Italian cars were given the color red and that's when you picture a Italian sports car, you always think of it as red because that was the color they were given by F1 and really no team like you say, with the possible exception now of Red Bull, but no team has really used F1 to market itself around the world as effectively as Ferrari."", ""Ricky Mulvey: What's been happening with Ferrari's resurgence? Because while it did, it dominated the arts with Michael Schumacher then it falls behind. This is something that Ferrari is intensely unhappy about, where you have the dynasty of Toto Wolff and Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes and now you have two straight constructors and drivers titles with with Red Bull, MaxxForce stop in last year. What did he win? He win basically all but two races."", ""Joshua Robinson: Ferrari was the only known Red Bull winner of a Grand Prix last year and there was only one of them. But this is a source of intense frustration and Maranello, but also Ferrari is for all of its technical aptitude and stylistic brilliance is also the team that can't get out of its own way a lot of the time. They've been known in recent years as these bumbling guys who mess up pitstops, pick the wrong strategy, and just can't quite put all the elements you need together."", ""Sometimes it's just straight-up bad luck but the pressure to win at Ferrari is incredibly intense and that dates back to Enzo. I think a lot of that comes down to the fact as Jon explained, that Ferrari has used F1 as its primary marketing tool forever and is so intrinsically linked to the sport. It's the only team that has participated in every season of Formula 1 and it was Bernie who said a long time ago in conversation with Enzo that Formula 1 is Ferrari and Ferrari is Formula 1, you cannot separate one from the other. All of that contributes to a huge amount of pressure to perform that often Ferrari collapses under."", 'Ricky Mulvey: I think you pointed out something interesting. Your book talks about it, which is the internal culture that, that creates where you have such an intense pressure, but you also have people who are unwilling to work with each other. I think it was basically people are almost more collaborative between Britain and Japan than they were in the same hall of a Ferrari office building and then that entropy can end up collapsing in on itself.', ""Right now we're at a point where people are a lot more optimistic about Ferrari in 2024 and part of that has to do with the signing of Lewis Hamilton. Certainly, Ferrari's investors are really optimistic about it but from the story perspective, what's going on with the resurgence? Why are folks so much more optimistic about Ferrari today than they were five or six years ago?"", ""Jonathan Clegg: Well, I think one of the reasons, like you say is, but they've signed Lewis Hamilton for the 2025 season and Hamilton obviously is tied for the record number of championships. Easily leadering in the most Korea F1 wins, most F1 propositions, one of the truly great drivers in F1 history. I think also they're optimistic because we're not far away from a rules change and one of the things that has characterized F1 through the years is that every four, five, six years they rip up the rule book and release a new series of specifications which has a knock-on effect of reordering the grid."", ""What that means is that the teams that were in the middle or at the back can sometimes get propelled to the front as they interpret the new regulations better. Whereas the teams who were on top who are trying to maximize their window and when as much as possible under the old rules, then find them find themselves move into the back. I think that's really the only thing that will end Red Bull's run at the moment is like a change of the rules because frankly, they're so far ahead that it really wouldn't be a surprise if they won every single race this year."", ""What the sport needs is one of these technical upheavals to reorder things and the next round of those is due for 2026 so what you're seeing is Ferrari getting closer to Red Bull. They're certainly the closest challenger to Red Bull. But I think what they're also doing is positioning themselves to really capitalize on the rules change that comes in 2026 at which time Hamilton would have had a year in the car and hopefully they'll be firing on all cylinders and able to really attack this rules change and be the team that really interprets the rules most effectively and starts out on top."", ""Joshua Robinson: Because this is a sport that needs rules change to stop what complete domination in a sport and that's what the history has been with. We mentioned Ferrari with Michael Schumacher then you have Mercedes and now a burgeoning dynasty. It read, not even burgeoning, give a dynasty at Red Bull. Why is F1 a sport where the underdog has such a difficult time winning or even getting to the top on any of the races."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Like Baseball, for example, you can have the worst team play the best team, but you know, 20-30% of the time the worst team might come out on top. Pick your sport. I think there might be some similar percentages, but in Formula 1 that's completely not the case. Why is that?"", 'Joshua Robinson: One, there is so much that goes into building a winning car that has to go right. You have to have the right combination of driver, of car, of strategy, of performance and qualifying, and everything else. There is less variance there, but in a larger sense, the teams, as they look at every rule change, will spend a year or two years devising the right setup and finding all the right loopholes. There are some people who are just much better at that than others and Adrian Newey, for instance, who is the Technical Director at Red Bull, is one of them.', ""Those are the moments in that phase of development where you can really steal a March on the rest of the field and what makes it difficult to then catch up is that there are huge limitations now on budget, on wind tunnel testing time. So all of that just makes it hard to close gaps because once your car is set at the beginning of the season, there's a very minimal amount of number of things you can do to improve it. You can marginally upgrade certain parts, but you're not going to change the overall aerodynamic design in a significant way at that stage of the season."", ""Jonathan Clegg: I think it also gets to the balance between the human aspect of F1, what the driver and what he controls versus the engineering internet technological aspects. One car is just quicker than the other. A Baseball team can play in on their best day this player is better than another and on another day that might be completely different, but one machine is just faster than the other. Although the human aspect plays a role, sometimes it's not enough to overcome the fact that the car just isn't as fast as one of the competitors."", ""Ricky Mulvey: One of the main themes, in your book, is basically who has the upper hand throughout with Bernie Ecclestone? It's Bernie Ecclestone has the upper hand with pretty much every single racetrack with the exception of what? Monaco. Then you have him getting toward the end and then these new investors come in, Ecclestone getting the upper hand against the other teams that he's competing against every team in Formula 1 trying to get the upper hand on each other in any given racing season."", 'One company that comes in unexpectedly and cheaply is Netflix, which completely changed the sport, completely changed the fandom and then they get into the paddock, is you right about relatively cheaply? This would have been completely unheard of just a few years ago. How does Netflix gets started in Formula 1? As you say relatively cheaply.', ""Joshua Robinson: During the Bernie era, the paddock had been this sanctum sanctorum, he wanted to control everything and every image of Formula 1. Lewis Hamilton talks about every time he posted something on Instagram, he'd get a cease and desist from Bernie. He didn't want to let cameras in, he didn't want anyone prying because this belong to the teams, this belonged to F1 and if things were going to emerge from there, he wanted to get paid for it."", ""Liberty comes in as a much savvier media operation. In one of their many efforts to open things up, lands on this idea with Netflix, not knowing what it was going to turn into. It was so off the wall and many teams were suspicious of it. Ferrari and Mercedes didn't even participate in Season 1, they kept it at a safe distance."", ""But pretty soon it exploded and it's no coincidence that Season 2 dropped two weeks before the pandemic became what it was in 2020 and two weeks before everyone was about to spend a year sitting on the couch watching TV. Toto Wolff said to us that to this day, they don't really know if the whole Netflix experiment and the way it exploded, it just lifted the sport to new heights was a lucky punch or stroke of genius."", ""Ricky Mulvey: At this point, who do you think has the upper hand in the relationship? Does Formula 1 have a sport where it can say, you know what, we're going to take our reality show to Apple or to Hulu, something like that. Or is Netflix in control of those negotiations?"", ""Jonathan Clegg: I think at the moment Netflix is in control because F1, as we discussed, I think there's still so much uncertainty around what exactly makes this show work so successfully that F1 would be very loathed to try something new. Because this has been probably the biggest single factor in the sports growth and popularity over the last five years. So Netflix certainly has that to its advantage. It also funny that we've seen them try to repeat this formula with other sports and it hasn't really worked. They've tried with tennis, they've tried with golf, they tried with cycling: ProCycling and none of them have really caught fire in the way that Drive to Survive did."", ""Whether that's to do with the timing aspect, the fact that the Drive to Survive dropped during COVID, or whether that's the fact that the people that make up the cost of F1 are uniquely well attuned to deliver like great reality TV because they are generally young, very good looking, smart, articulate, vicious backbiters and snipers, and constantly shit talking each other. I don't think anyone really knows exactly why Drive to Survive has worked in a way that typical fly on-the wall sports documentaries generally haven't."", ""F1 are pretty open about that and pretty open about the fact that they're just going to ride this wave while they can. They see this as a chance to shore up their popularity and raise the floor so that if and when Drive to Survive does go away, they've still got enough people who are willing to stick around. Like you say, I'm sure that they will find a way to put an F1 behind the scenes show somewhere else in the event that Netflix does pull the plug."", ""Ricky Mulvey: What do you think? Formula 1 famously on the cutting edge, you talk about how, what does it? Even the truck drivers with the best truck drivers. Liberty Media has been at the forefront of changing the way people interact with Formula 1. One example now is the virtual reality headsets where you're going to be able to look down on, essentially, a live race circuit and see where all of the cars are. That's just one example. How do you think fans will interact with Formula 1 in 3-5 years? How do you think that'll change?"", ""Joshua Robinson: Well, I think that's the next frontier for F1. As it prepares for a post Drive to Survive future, it's throwing a lot of stuff at the wall trying to figure out what's going to stick and whether that is finding other ways for them to consume like non-race content. I'm thinking of projects like the Brad Pitt, Jerry Bruckheimer Apple movie that's due out in 2025. Whether that's also changing the live race experience, which they've been pretty good about already and giving access to much more data."", ""I think you real petrolheads who still watch F1 are now watching it with two or three screens where they have live timing and things like that. That was already a major step for F1, which when Liberty came in, felt, this is still too opaque. People still don't know what's happening, let's have the live list of positions on screen at all times so that you know what you're looking at."", ""With the rise of virtual reality and things like that, I think the one thing I've heard they want to do is create a E-Racing situation, where you in your rig at home or on your laptop can race against live positions the drivers in the race are taking up. There are a lot of options here and the technology maybe for the first time exists to do that. Whether the appetite is really there for people who primarily interact with F1 through Drive to Survive or drivers Instagrams remains to be seen."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I'm going to take that on easy mode first before I jump into a sim racing car against Verstappen, Sergio Perez, and Lewis Hamilton, and the bunch. Last question might be an unfair ones, so you can feel free to swat it back at me. Liberty Media got Formula 1 for about eight billion. You're right in a sequel, in 10 years, maybe it's called the Formula back and better than ever, let's get down to booging, I don't know, but you've got a sequel coming out for your Formula 1 book. How do you think we will look back on that deal and maybe Formula 1 in 2024?"", ""Joshua Robinson: I'm not certain that Liberty Media will still own it by then in 10 years time, there was a rumored Saudi bid for about $20 billion. Liberty joke, if it were true, it was probably a little bit low, but I think there is an element of truth to it. I don't think that the way we've seen the Saudi public investment fund throw money around in global sports, that F1 is one that they can necessarily resist. They're all through Aramco, they're already one of the major sponsors of the sport. They just had a Grand Prix in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf footprint is expanding all the time in motorsport. I think that'll come back at some stage. They are perfectly capable of making it eight billion looked like a total steal."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Joshua, Jon, thank you so much for your time.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward.

Amgen’s bid to gain confirmatory approval was unsuccessful, and the company has four years to complete another trial testing its pill.', 'Both Krazati and Lumakras target tumors harboring a mutation in a gene called KRAS — a long-sought goal of drugmakers. While their uptake is currently modest, both Bristol Myers and Amgen are working to expand their use into earlier lines of treatment and other types of cancer.', 'KRAS mutations are one of the most common in non-small cell lung cancer. People whose tumors are positive for the mutation have poorer prognosis than those who don’t. For years, developers tried and failed to come up with a targeted KRAS therapy, leading some to consider it “undruggable.” That changed when Amgen was able to quickly push Lumakras through clinical trials and onto the market.', 'Yet the two drugs aren’t selling that quickly. Amgen reported Lumakras sales of $280 million in 2023, a slight decline from the year earlier. Krazati’s original developer, Mirati Therapeutics, reported $36 million in sales through the first nine months of 2023. Bristol Myers’ $4.8 billion acquisition of Mirati closed in January.', 'Under Mirati, Krazati won conditional, or “accelerated,” FDA approval on the basis of a trial that measured response but didn’t compare Krazati to another treatment or placebo. In 112 patients who had progressed following treatment with chemotherapy and an immunotherapy like Merck & Co.’s Keytruda, Krazati spurred partial remissions in 42%.', ""In the KRYSTAL-12 trial for which Bristol Myers reported results Thursday, Krazati was compared to treatment with docetaxel in more than 400 patients. The company didn't disclose full results, but said Krazati met the study’s primary goal of improving progression-free survival over docetaxel, as well as a key secondary goal of response rate. The trial is continuing so researchers can test whether the people who received Krazati will live longer overall than those given docetaxel."", 'Because the trial is in the same population for which Krazati already has conditional approval, it probably will not expand the number of patients eligible to receive the drug. However, it could give regulators and physicians more confidence Krazati is a better choice than chemotherapy — depending on how the full data looks.', 'Bristol Myers has submitted an application to the FDA to use Krazati in combination with chemotherapy in people whose KRAS-mutated colorectal cancer has returned after treatment. The FDA’s deadline decision is June 21.', 'Also on Thursday, Bristol Myers reported negative results for a study of its immune disease drug Zeposia in Crohn’s disease. Along with Krazati, Zeposia is one of several drugs Bristol Myers is counting on to grow sales.', 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.

You can skip our detailed analysis on these formidable, well-trained units and head over directly to the 5 Most Elite US Military Special Forces and Their Role.', 'American special forces have captured the imagination of popular culture in the country for quite some time, and often bring to mind movies such as the Black Hawk Down, or video games like Call of Duty. There is immense prestige associated with these warrior units within the US military as well. These top-notched special forces are made up of some of the finest soldiers recruited from across the nation after a high level of rigorous training.', 'Special forces have historically worked in small units and were called in only for critical missions. However, since the advent of the war against terrorism, their role has significantly expanded. The United States Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, has grown from 38,000 personnel since the September 11 attacks in 2001 to 73,000 by 2020, with their budget also skyrocketing 495% from $2.3 billion to $13.7 billion during the period.', 'Given the complex challenges these special forces undertake, the US is equipping its units with sophisticated equipment to dominate the battlefield and defy challenges that come in their way. Last year in July, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) announced that Dry Combat Submersible (DCS) – a project it had been working on for several decades – had achieved initial operational capability.', 'Two of the three DCSs have already been provided by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to the military, which would enable the Navy SEALs to travel well below the surface of the ocean without wetsuits, as well as get in and out of the submersibles undetected while being entirely submerged. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a key industrial partner of US special operations forces, and is also the primary contractor for SOCOM’s logistics and sustainment support program.', 'Seabed capabilities of the American Navy are also being ramped up at a pace. As noted in a report in May 2023, the Navy has commissioned a next-generation attack submarine, for the Navy SEALs to perform covert operations along the floor of the ocean, such as retrieving parts of missiles and rockets tested underwater, and tapping deep sea communication cables. Work on the project is underway at General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD).', 'General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) had also previously been providing professional services to American military special forces for their global operations. The company had signed a five-year, $900 million contract with SOCOM between 2016 and 2021, which included services like technical support, engineering for major weapon systems, and assisting the units with decision making related to production and program control. ARMA Global, a subsidiary of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), executed work on the agreement.', 'On the other hand, SOCOM’s fleet of MH-47G Chinook helicopters is also being upgraded, for which The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) received a $271 million modification contract in December 2023. Under the agreement, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) will procure six MH-47G rotary wing renewal build aircraft for SOCOM. Work on the program is likely to be completed around mid-2027. Earlier last year, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) also won a task order, valued at $18 million, for the acquisition of components and parts for the aircraft.', 'Getmilitaryphotos/Shutterstock.com', 'Multiple sources were considered to develop consensus and rank the most elite US military special forces. These included Insider Monkey and Yahoo Finance’s recent article, 11 Countries with the Best Military Special Forces in the World, CBS News’ list of The most elite U.S. special forces, Special Ops Magazine’s 2022 List of Elite US Special Forces, Asymmetric Warfare Group’s write-up titled The most elite special operations forces in the US, and Business Insider’s piece on the most elite special forces units in the US.', 'We observed special forces units that received mention on these websites, and then ranked them based on their operational expertise and strategic importance.', 'If interested, you can also take a look at the 11 Countries with the Highest Number of Military Special Forces in the World.\xa0', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.', 'Let’s now take a look at the most elite US military special forces and their role.', 'The Special Operations Weather Technicians, abbreviated as SOWT, are meteorologists of the United States Air Force, with ground-combat training. These personnel are tasked with gathering intelligence from forward deployed locations related to weather and terrain, including oceans and rivers, in hostile territory, which assist in planning special-operation missions. The weather technicians are trained enough to accompany conventional military units in the battlefield as well. All special forces operations in the US are planned using the intelligence and coordination provided by the Special Operations Weather Technicians.', 'The Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen of the Navy are one of the most elite US military special forces. These units have amphibious mission expertise, with personnel trained to operate in challenging operations around rivers and coastal areas. These forces typically take part in operations that are spearheaded by the Navy SEALs, and focus on special weapons and tactics, infiltration, and exfiltration during combat. The Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen notably served in Operation Iraqi Freedom.', 'Next on our list of the most elite US military special forces is the Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team, abbreviated as FAST. The unit is part of the security force regiment of the Marine Corps, and is tasked with protecting sensitive naval installations, as well American diplomatic missions and embassies abroad. Other roles of the force include physical security, counter surveillance, and close quarter combat. This month, the United States Southern Command deployed the Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Team at the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.', 'The Marine Raiders are the combat units of the United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC), with its personnel trained in special reconnaissance, direct action, unconventional warfare, and foreign internal defense. The regiment comprises a headquarter company and three battalions, with each battalion then containing 4 Marine Special Operations Companies (MSOCs). The Marine Raiders were established during World War II to take part in amphibious warfare, and has since then being regarded among the top special forces in the United States.', 'Next up in the 11th spot is Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company, or ANGLICO, which is the airborne fire support unit of the Marine Corps. These special forces are recognized for being the only full-time firepower control team under the Department of Defense that is capable of coordinating fire support from air, land, and sea. ANGLICO’s personnel receive training in close air support, ground-based fire support, and are known for their prowess in cannon, rocket artillery, and precision-guided munitions. It is among the most elite US military special forces.', 'The 75th Ranger Regiment is an elite, airborne-qualified light infantry special forces unit under the command of the US Army, that support forces like Delta, and can also conduct raids on enemy targets themselves. It takes one year of training for new recruits to become an Army Ranger. Some of the courses and qualifications these personnel go through include combat diving, military freefall, parachuting, survival escape, and mountain warfare among others.', 'The Air Force Combat Controllers are among the top special forces units in the United States. The unit holds expertise in stealth insertion behind enemy lines and often coordinates attacks by ground troops by providing them air support. Their personnel are skilled in air traffic control, fire support, command and control, and communications. It takes 2 years of rigorous training to join the combat control team, with between 90-95% of the initial applicants missing out due to self-eliminations, injuries, and academic failures. According to the Asymmetric Warfare Group, the Air Force Combat Control Team likely played a role in the Libyan Revolution against Gaddafi’s regime.\xa0', 'The USAF’s Pararescuemen are highly-trained personnel who go well behind enemy lines and rescue lost men. Their role is different from the combat control team in the sense that their responsibility is to rescue, not offensive operations. Despite that, the pararescue force is well equipped and skilled to face enemy combatants on the ground through guerilla tactics and specialized small unit attacks. These pararescuemen experience rigorous training in parachuting, combat diving, basic survival, underwater missions, paramedic training, and specialized courses in pararescue recovery before joining the force.', 'The Green Berets are the US Army Special Forces, comprising versatile troops with expertise in unconventional warfare, special reconnaissance, direct action, counter-terrorism, and counter proliferation, among others. The Green Berets were among the first military units to enter Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks, and have played an active role in several American military operations and wars over the years, including in Laos, Vietnam, El Salvador, Kuwait, and Iraq.', 'Next up is Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance, a special operations force with the primary responsibility to gather intelligence required for the Marine Corps to conduct their missions. The unit also has a direct action role and has expertise in covert maritime infiltration. Some of the responsibilities of the Force Recon include scout swimming, coastline reconnaissance, maritime interdiction, and direct action where required. Their personnel are trained in parachuting, skiing, and amphibious techniques.', 'Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Elite US Military Special Forces and Their Role.', 'Suggested Articles:', '15 Countries that have the Most F-16 Fighter Jets', '15 Countries that will have the Most Powerful Militaries by 2030', '16 Strongest Navies in the World in 2024', 'Disclosure: None. 15 Most Elite US Military Special Forces and Their Role is originally published on Insider Monkey.']"

Dividend stocks have delivered a consistent performance in periods of market instability. Their past performance, high yields, and their ability to generate stable and regular income have once again captured investors’ attention, following a period of underperformance due to the tech rally in 2023.', 'Investors consider high yields one of the most important aspects of dividend investing. The previous performance of high-yielding dividend stocks has shown that these equities have shown better results over the long term. In our article titled 12 Best High Dividend Stocks Under $100, we referred to a study by the University of Nevada, which analyzed the performance of dividend stocks by categorizing them into portfolios according to their yields. The results showed that the highest-yielding stocks from the Dow 30 index yielded better returns than portfolios with low and medium dividend yields from 1987 to 2012.', 'In addition to their outperformance relative to low-dividend stocks, high-yield equities have also surpassed the S&P 500 over the last thirty years. According to a report by Barron’s, high-yield dividend stocks have beaten the S&P 500 by over 20% each year in relative total returns from the lowest to the highest point within cycles lasting nearly a year. The report also mentioned that these stocks normally maintain their strong performance for about two years after reaching their peak.', 'BMO’s Chief Investment Strategist Brian Belski spoke with Barron’s about the impressive performance of dividend stocks with high yields over the years. Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“There have been only two periods where high dividend-yielding stocks have performed worse relative to the S&P 500 on a year-over-year basis: the tech bubble and the pandemic. According to our work, this type of abnormal underperformance has typically proved to be an inflection point historically. These stocks tend to stage an impressive recovery following such levels.”', 'Though dividend yields have gained the utmost importance in dividend investing, dividend growth also holds a significant position, as it indicates the company’s financial position. Companies with strong dividend growth track records, offering comparatively high yields, can attract long-term investors, who seek benefit from current income and potential future returns. Some of the best dividend stocks in this regard are Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), as these companies have raised their dividends for years consistently and also boast above-average dividend yields. In this article, we will further take a look at high-dividend stocks according to hedge funds.', 'Photo by nick chong on Unsplash', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023 and picked 1 dividend stocks that have yields above 8%, as of March 29.

Over the past few years, the company developed into a growth darling thanks to its strong track record in renewable energy development and tailwinds from the global energy transition and incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act. The problem for NextEra, and the transition broadly, is that this transformation is immensely capital intensive and many renewables projects offer lower returns on that capital. This requires high capital expenditures – often resulting in negative free cash flow – to meet the growth and financing needs of companies like NextEra. To help, the company leaned on financial engineering by using a publicly traded limited partnership called NextEra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE:NEP), providing further capacity for its parent to continue its development plans. NEP used layers of its own financial engineering to fund its own negative free cash flow and a large, growing dividend yield that we believe it could not sustain organically. Ultimately, the higher cost of debt from rising rates led NEP to lower its own growth ambitions, driving concerns about whether NextEra can execute on its extensive backlog.

If you want to skip our coverage of the global food industry and recent events, then you can check out 5 Biggest Food Companies in the World by Revenue. ', 'Just like the oil industry, the food industry is another sector that is quite crucial to global economic well being. Over the course of time, advances in transportation have ensured that the global food industry is an intermix of products shipped all over the world, a fact that makes it quite vulnerable as the world witnessed in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Since both countries are key global suppliers of commodities such as grain and wheat, their conflict made food prices surge all over as investors worried about supply chain shocks.', 'Similarly, advances in production and agriculture technology also mean that as countries such as India are able to utilize their natural advances for mass producing commodities such as sugar and rice, they are also able to influence global food prices as was evident last year in the rice industry after India banned its rice exports. For more details about the rice industry, you can check out Top 20 Rice Producing Countries In The World.', 'Since then, the global food industry and food prices have somewhat stabilized particularly after record interest rate hiking sprees by central banks. As opposed to high growth stock market sectors such as technology, food companies and food company stocks are more stable and do not entice investors who are chasing lucrative share price appreciations Their stability comes from the fact that food company stocks benefit from stable demand for their products even during an economic downturn. As a whole, these stocks are dubbed as consumer staples and you can find out more about them by reading 14 Best Consumer Staples Stocks To Buy Now.', 'Building on this, 2023 and 2024 have been marked by a renewed investor focus on technology stocks, with artificial intelligence companies such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in particular attracting billions of dollars in capital. At the same time, this continuing popularity and utility of technology has also continued to affect the global food industry. For instance, the food industry is known for controversial products such as palm oil and the impact they have on global greenhouse gas emissions. On this front, a British startup focusing on manufacturing oils and fat sustainably scored a win in March 2024 when it secured €2.9 million in investments.', ""One particular area of the food industry that has been creating quite a bit of buzz these days is the cocoa industry. One of the hottest food raw materials over the past couple of years has been cocoa. Cocoa is used to make chocolate, and recent price movements in this commodity have meant that investing in cocoa might have been better for those fortunate to have done so than buying NVIDIA's shares before the start of the late 2022 - early 2023 AI wave on Wall Street. May cocoa futures crossed a whopping $10,000 per ton in March 2024, to mark a whopping 246% gain over the past twelve months. The reason cocoa prices are high is because there are supply disruptions in the production hub of Africa, with multiple analysts expecting that global cocoa supply will shrink over the next year or so."", 'So, as the food industry continues to be quite dynamic despite being a stable sector, we decided to look at the biggest food companies in the world.

You can skip our detailed analysis on these formidable, well-trained units and head over directly to the 5 Most Elite US Military Special Forces and Their Role.', 'American special forces have captured the imagination of popular culture in the country for quite some time, and often bring to mind movies such as the Black Hawk Down, or video games like Call of Duty. There is immense prestige associated with these warrior units within the US military as well. These top-notched special forces are made up of some of the finest soldiers recruited from across the nation after a high level of rigorous training.', 'Special forces have historically worked in small units and were called in only for critical missions. However, since the advent of the war against terrorism, their role has significantly expanded. The United States Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, has grown from 38,000 personnel since the September 11 attacks in 2001 to 73,000 by 2020, with their budget also skyrocketing 495% from $2.3 billion to $13.7 billion during the period.', 'Given the complex challenges these special forces undertake, the US is equipping its units with sophisticated equipment to dominate the battlefield and defy challenges that come in their way. Last year in July, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) announced that Dry Combat Submersible (DCS) – a project it had been working on for several decades – had achieved initial operational capability.', 'Two of the three DCSs have already been provided by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to the military, which would enable the Navy SEALs to travel well below the surface of the ocean without wetsuits, as well as get in and out of the submersibles undetected while being entirely submerged. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a key industrial partner of US special operations forces, and is also the primary contractor for SOCOM’s logistics and sustainment support program.', 'Seabed capabilities of the American Navy are also being ramped up at a pace. As noted in a report in May 2023, the Navy has commissioned a next-generation attack submarine, for the Navy SEALs to perform covert operations along the floor of the ocean, such as retrieving parts of missiles and rockets tested underwater, and tapping deep sea communication cables. Work on the project is underway at General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD).', 'General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) had also previously been providing professional services to American military special forces for their global operations. The company had signed a five-year, $900 million contract with SOCOM between 2016 and 2021, which included services like technical support, engineering for major weapon systems, and assisting the units with decision making related to production and program control. ARMA Global, a subsidiary of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), executed work on the agreement.', 'On the other hand, SOCOM’s fleet of MH-47G Chinook helicopters is also being upgraded, for which The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) received a $271 million modification contract in December 2023. Under the agreement, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) will procure six MH-47G rotary wing renewal build aircraft for SOCOM. Work on the program is likely to be completed around mid-2027. Earlier last year, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) also won a task order, valued at $18 million, for the acquisition of components and parts for the aircraft.', 'Getmilitaryphotos/Shutterstock.com', 'Multiple sources were considered to develop consensus and rank the most elite US military special forces. These included Insider Monkey and Yahoo Finance’s recent article, 11 Countries with the Best Military Special Forces in the World, CBS News’ list of The most elite U.S. special forces, Special Ops Magazine’s 2022 List of Elite US Special Forces, Asymmetric Warfare Group’s write-up titled The most elite special operations forces in the US, and Business Insider’s piece on the most elite special forces units in the US.', 'We observed special forces units that received mention on these websites, and then ranked them based on their operational expertise and strategic importance.', 'If interested, you can also take a look at the 11 Countries with the Highest Number of Military Special Forces in the World.\xa0', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.', 'Let’s now take a look at the most elite US military special forces and their role.', 'The Special Operations Weather Technicians, abbreviated as SOWT, are meteorologists of the United States Air Force, with ground-combat training. These personnel are tasked with gathering intelligence from forward deployed locations related to weather and terrain, including oceans and rivers, in hostile territory, which assist in planning special-operation missions. The weather technicians are trained enough to accompany conventional military units in the battlefield as well. All special forces operations in the US are planned using the intelligence and coordination provided by the Special Operations Weather Technicians.', 'The Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen of the Navy are one of the most elite US military special forces. These units have amphibious mission expertise, with personnel trained to operate in challenging operations around rivers and coastal areas. These forces typically take part in operations that are spearheaded by the Navy SEALs, and focus on special weapons and tactics, infiltration, and exfiltration during combat. The Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen notably served in Operation Iraqi Freedom.', 'Next on our list of the most elite US military special forces is the Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team, abbreviated as FAST. The unit is part of the security force regiment of the Marine Corps, and is tasked with protecting sensitive naval installations, as well American diplomatic missions and embassies abroad. Other roles of the force include physical security, counter surveillance, and close quarter combat. This month, the United States Southern Command deployed the Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Team at the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.', 'The Marine Raiders are the combat units of the United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC), with its personnel trained in special reconnaissance, direct action, unconventional warfare, and foreign internal defense. The regiment comprises a headquarter company and three battalions, with each battalion then containing 4 Marine Special Operations Companies (MSOCs). The Marine Raiders were established during World War II to take part in amphibious warfare, and has since then being regarded among the top special forces in the United States.', 'Next up in the 11th spot is Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company, or ANGLICO, which is the airborne fire support unit of the Marine Corps. These special forces are recognized for being the only full-time firepower control team under the Department of Defense that is capable of coordinating fire support from air, land, and sea. ANGLICO’s personnel receive training in close air support, ground-based fire support, and are known for their prowess in cannon, rocket artillery, and precision-guided munitions. It is among the most elite US military special forces.', 'The 75th Ranger Regiment is an elite, airborne-qualified light infantry special forces unit under the command of the US Army, that support forces like Delta, and can also conduct raids on enemy targets themselves. It takes one year of training for new recruits to become an Army Ranger. Some of the courses and qualifications these personnel go through include combat diving, military freefall, parachuting, survival escape, and mountain warfare among others.', 'The Air Force Combat Controllers are among the top special forces units in the United States. The unit holds expertise in stealth insertion behind enemy lines and often coordinates attacks by ground troops by providing them air support. Their personnel are skilled in air traffic control, fire support, command and control, and communications. It takes 2 years of rigorous training to join the combat control team, with between 90-95% of the initial applicants missing out due to self-eliminations, injuries, and academic failures. According to the Asymmetric Warfare Group, the Air Force Combat Control Team likely played a role in the Libyan Revolution against Gaddafi’s regime.\xa0', 'The USAF’s Pararescuemen are highly-trained personnel who go well behind enemy lines and rescue lost men. Their role is different from the combat control team in the sense that their responsibility is to rescue, not offensive operations. Despite that, the pararescue force is well equipped and skilled to face enemy combatants on the ground through guerilla tactics and specialized small unit attacks. These pararescuemen experience rigorous training in parachuting, combat diving, basic survival, underwater missions, paramedic training, and specialized courses in pararescue recovery before joining the force.', 'The Green Berets are the US Army Special Forces, comprising versatile troops with expertise in unconventional warfare, special reconnaissance, direct action, counter-terrorism, and counter proliferation, among others. The Green Berets were among the first military units to enter Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks, and have played an active role in several American military operations and wars over the years, including in Laos, Vietnam, El Salvador, Kuwait, and Iraq.', 'Next up is Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance, a special operations force with the primary responsibility to gather intelligence required for the Marine Corps to conduct their missions. The unit also has a direct action role and has expertise in covert maritime infiltration. Some of the responsibilities of the Force Recon include scout swimming, coastline reconnaissance, maritime interdiction, and direct action where required.

If you want to read further about dividend investing, go directly to have a look at 10 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.\xa0', ""Investors tend to gravitate towards investments that provide them with income, and dividend stocks are particularly popular in this regard. These stocks stand out for their ability to generate consistent income streams. Dividends represent a share of a company's profits that are allocated to its shareholders either as cash payments or in the form of additional shares of stock. Investing in dividends may appear simple at first glance, as it involves investors anticipating regular payments on a quarterly, monthly, or yearly basis. However, this investment strategy involves a multitude of considerations when selecting suitable stocks. Key factors include the growth rate of dividends, the compounding impact of reinvesting dividends, payout ratios, cash flow analysis, and dividend yields. Understanding these elements is essential for making informed decisions when venturing into dividend stock investments."", 'One of the key factors that greatly attracts investors is the consistent increase in dividends over time. Stocks that consistently raise their dividends have historically demonstrated superior performance, delivering enhanced returns to shareholders. These types of stocks become particularly valuable during periods of financial instability or economic downturns when investors seek reliable income streams. Examples of top dividend stocks renowned for their sustained dividend growth include Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP). These companies have consistently rewarded shareholders with growing dividends over the years.', 'Investing in dividends offers multiple avenues for investors to explore, and when executed effectively, it has the potential to create substantial wealth for individuals. For this reason, we have compiled a list of 25 things every dividend investor should know.', 'Photo by Marga Santoso on Unsplash', 'Over an extended period, dividend-paying stocks have played a substantial role in driving the overall returns of the market. A study conducted by Hartford Funds revealed that between 1940 and 2023, dividends accounted for an average of 34% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index. Additionally, during decades such as the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, where total returns were below 10%, dividends made a significant contribution to the overall returns. Another study conducted by S&P Dow Jones Indices highlighted the impact of dividend-paying stocks on overall investment returns throughout the 2000s. According to the report, dividend income accounted for approximately 68% of the total returns during that decade.', 'Stocks that do not pay dividends have consistently underperformed dividend-paying stocks over time, particularly in certain market situations. For instance, during market downturns such as the one witnessed in 2022, where the S&P 500 Index dropped by over 18%, dividend-paying assets demonstrated their capacity to shield investors from significant losses. In 2022, stocks listed in the S&P 500 that distributed dividends experienced a decline of 11.1%, while those that did not pay dividends suffered a much steeper loss of 38.7%.', 'Analyzing the performance over the long term reveals the robust returns delivered by dividend-paying companies. Research from Hartford Funds indicated that from 1973 to 2023, companies distributing dividends achieved an average annual return of 9.17%. In contrast, non-dividend-paying companies yielded a significantly lower average return of 4.27% over the same period. Furthermore, companies that maintained consistent dividend policies throughout this timeframe returned an average of 6.74%.', ""During market downturns, investors often grapple with concerns about their investments, particularly exacerbated by the impact of inflation. Fortunately, dividend stocks have demonstrated resilience during inflationary periods compared to other asset classes. According to a report by Hartford Funds, between 1970 and 2022, there were eight such inflationary periods, during which dividend-paying companies consistently outperformed their non-dividend-paying counterparts. The report highlighted the 1970s as one of the most notorious periods of American inflation, driven by surging oil prices. Despite market challenges, dividends played a pivotal role, accounting for a significant portion of returns, with as much as 73% of the S&P 500's returns attributed to dividends during this time."", 'One of the main reasons for this outperformance of dividend stocks is their tendency to generate substantial free cash flow. Unlike growth-focused companies that prioritize reinvestment for expansion, dividend-paying companies have established revenue streams and financial stability, making them more resilient in slowing growth or recessionary environments. Their ability to maintain consistent dividend payments reflects their sound financial health and adaptability during adverse market conditions.', 'Over time, inflation gradually diminishes the purchasing power of currency, posing challenges for income investors. However, dividends offer a notable advantage during periods of high inflation due to their potential for growth compared to fixed bond coupons. Research from BlackRock underscored this, revealing that over the past 150 years, dividends from U.S. companies have experienced an average annual growth rate of 3.7%, outpacing the average annual inflation rate of 2%.', 'Wisdom Tree conducted research confirming that dividends have consistently surpassed inflation rates. Their findings indicate that between 1957 and 2022, dividends experienced an average annual growth of 5.7%, exceeding the inflation rate by more than 2%. Similarly, from 1990 to 2022, dividends from the S&P 500 grew by 5.61%, while inflation only saw a growth of 2.64% during the same period. This highlights the ability of dividends to provide investors with a hedge against inflation and potentially enhance their purchasing power over time.', 'The regular dividend payments paid to investors act as a buffer during market downturns, providing stability to the stock’s price. In addition to this, companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders have stable cash flows and established business models, which can lower the volatility. Wisdom Tree reported that stock prices are over two times more volatile than dividend stocks. The firm gathered data from the last 64 years and highlighted that there were only six instances during this period where dividends decreased, and only one of those cases saw a decline of over 5%. In comparison, stock prices experienced declines in 18 of those years, with the most severe yearly decline surpassing 40%. The report also mentioned that on average, stocks fell by more than 11% annually during that period.', 'Companies that regularly grow their dividends are particularly less volatile than other asset classes. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, when the market experienced declines between December 31, 1999, and March 31, 2022, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats showed better performance compared to both the S&P Composite 1500 and the S&P 500 High Dividend Index, outpacing by 140 basis points per month and by 49 basis points per month, respectively.', 'The payout ratio is one of the most useful important metrics for evaluating dividend-paying companies. This mainly analyses how much of a company’s income is being distributed among its shareholders in the form of dividends. A high payout ratio is not considered healthy, as it shows that a company is paying more than it can afford. On the other hand, a low ratio indicates that a company is maintaining more earnings for reinvestments and to fulfill shareholder obligations. According to analysts, the dividend payout ratio of between 35% and 55% is considered healthy as it shows that the company has enough money left over to reinvest for growth.', 'The Wellington Management did a detailed study on that and categorized dividend-paying stocks in the S&P 500 into quintiles based on their dividend yields and payout ratios. The highest dividend-paying stocks, representing the top 20%, comprised the first quintile, while the lowest and non-payers constituted the fifth quintile. Over nine decades, from 1930 to 2019, the study examined the performance of each quintile. Results showed that second-quintile stocks outperformed the S&P 500 in seven out of nine periods, accounting for 77.8% of the time. The first and third quintiles tied for second place, outperforming the index in six out of nine periods. However, fourth and fifth-quintile stocks performed less favorably, outperforming the index in only four instances each. One explanation for the outperformance of second-quintile dividend stocks compared to the first quintile is their lower average dividend payout ratio. The first-quintile payout ratio averaged slightly above 70%, while the second-quintile payout ratio averaged just over 40%.', ""Investors often consider high dividend yield as an advantageous feature when investing in dividend stocks. However, high yields are not always practical as this could be a sign that the stock price has fallen significantly, which could be a sign of an underlying issue within the company. In addition to this, high-dividend stocks can be more volatile because they are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and market conditions. The Wellington Management study discovered that stocks with the highest levels of dividend payouts and yields have shown strong performance over time. However, they didn't perform as well as stocks that pay high, though not the absolute highest, levels of dividend payouts and yields."", 'According to analysts, a dividend yield between 3% and 5% is generally considered healthy as this range creates a balance between being neither excessively high nor too low. According to a report by Nuveen, global dividend-paying companies with a more moderate yield (0-3%) typically exhibit stronger potential for earnings growth, more robust profitability metrics, and higher profit margins in comparison to high dividend-yielding companies (those with yields above 3%) and companies that do not pay dividends at all. These factors often contribute to reducing risk, particularly during periods of heightened market volatility.', 'High dividend yields, when combined with a track record of consistent dividend growth record, can offer great investment opportunities for investors. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (NYSE:TDS), and British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI) are some of the best stocks in this regard as these companies have consistently raised their payouts for years and also boast above-average dividend yields.', 'As mentioned above, dividend growers take the lead among investors when it comes to investing in dividend stocks. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index seeks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some examples of dividend aristocrat stocks that are popular among investors. Their ability to raise dividends consistently stems from their strong balance sheets and stable cash generation. Due to these qualities, these stocks have performed better than others over the course of history. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the Dividend Aristocrat index has shown a notable capacity to protect against downturns, as evidenced by their upside and downside capture ratios. The report highlighted that these stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 around 69.34% of the time during down months and approximately 43.6% of the time during up months. Dividend aristocrats also delivered an average excess return of 1.05% in down months over the broader market index. In addition to this, the index experienced lower drawdown levels compared to the S&P 500.', 'The outperformance of dividend aristocrats also brings in the factor of high dividend yields, highlighting the advantage that dividend growers hold over those with simply high yields. ProShares reported that dividend growth has consistently demonstrated strong performance regardless of the direction of the interest rates. According to the report, from May 2005 to December 2023, the Dividend Aristocrats index delivered an 11.55% return in rising interest rate periods, compared with a 10.46% return of high-yield dividend stocks, represented by the Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index. Similarly, in falling interest rate periods, dividend aristocrats returned 12.50%, surpassing a 7.90% return of high dividend stocks. Overall during this period, dividend growers yielded a 12% return, outperforming high-yield stocks, which delivered a 9.27% return.', 'The importance of dividend growth cannot be emphasized enough as it reflects the company’s financial health and strength. The consistency in growing dividends shows that the company is generating sustainable earnings and has confidence in its future payouts. Abrdn reported that dividend growers and initiators delivered a compounded return of 10.68% from December 2002 to December 2022, significantly outperforming dividend cutters and eliminators, which returned 2.70% during this period. Non-dividend payers were also behind companies with regular dividend growth, returning 9.25% within this timeframe.', 'Dividend growth and strong cash flow go hand in hand because this serves as a testament to the company’s financial health and stability. These companies generate reliable and consistent earnings from their main operations, which provides a solid foundation for maintaining and growing dividend payments over time. In addition to this, these companies can smoothly invest in growth initiatives, research and development, and other strategic opportunities with the ample cash that they generate.', 'Following in the trend, analysts are positive about dividend growth in the future as the cash on the corporate balance sheets has increased significantly over the years. According to a report by Global Market Intelligence, 13 non-financial S&P 500 companies collectively hold cash and investments of over $1 trillion, as of September 2023. These include some of the strongest dividend companies, such as Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM),\xa0 and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH).', ""The data we have mentioned in this article so far highlights the importance of dividend stocks in the long run. However, some investors also exploit dividend equities for short-term gains through a strategy called dividend capture strategy. The goal of this approach is to secure the dividend payment while minimizing exposure to the stock's price movements. The ex-dividend date is the day on which a stock begins trading without the dividend payment included in its price. Investors who own the stock on or before the ex-dividend date are entitled to receive the dividend payment."", 'Dividend stocks are found across a variety of industries and sectors, including technology, healthcare, consumer goods, finance, utilities, and more. Certain sectors pay higher dividends compared to others and have varying dividend yields. Real estate and utilities sectors exhibit the highest dividend yields, averaging around 4%. On the other hand, though the tech sector merged as the winner in 2023, it tends to offer lower yields, averaging below 1%. As of 2023, the energy sector has taken the spotlight for raising its dividends and launching debt reduction programs, replacing both utilities and real estate. Both these sectors have announced various dividend cuts throughout the year, mainly due to fluctuating interest rates. That said, these three sectors still make up the best investment options for income investors as there are a lot of undervalued opportunities within them, according to Morningstar chief US market strategist David Sekera.', 'What could be better than owning one dividend stock? Investing in a basket of dividend stocks and dividend ETFs offers exactly that. ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, are investment funds that trade on stock exchanges and hold a diversified portfolio of stocks from various sectors and industries. By investing in dividend ETFs, investors can gain exposure to a wide range of companies, effectively eliminating risks associated with investing heavily in a single sector or stock. Dividend ETFs were popular among investors in 2022 but due to the tech rally last year, these funds also saw a decline in their inflows. Nevertheless, dividend funds gathered a total of $3.9 billion in 2023, which, unfortunately, is their lowest annual collection since 2009 (see 11 Best Dividend ETFs to Buy Now)', 'The prices of dividend stocks can also fluctuate as these equities are not completely immune to market downturns. They can provide a hedge against inflationary periods, but that performance mainly depends on a number of factors. Dividend payments aren’t guaranteed, unlike the interest payments from the Treasuries. Companies can reduce or eliminate their payouts at any point in time, a risk that became evident during the pandemic of 2020 when approximately 68 out of roughly 380 dividend-paying companies in the S&P 500 either suspended or decreased their dividends.', 'High-interest rates have been a cause of worry for investors since 2022. In our article titled 13 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates, we highlighted that between March 2022 and July 2023, the Federal Reserve implemented a series of 11 rate hikes to the federal funds rate. In addition to this, interest rates in the broader bond market rose, leading to increased borrowing expenses for both businesses and individuals. In this aspect, dividend stocks have offered investors a sense of relief as they typically hold up better during periods of high-interest rates.', 'According to a report by ProShares, dividend growth strategies, which include companies that have raised their payouts consistently for years, are often considered reliable approaches that perform effectively across different interest rate climates. These strategies have demonstrated strong performance over the years regardless of fluctuations in interest rates. The report further mentioned that portfolios investing in dividend growth stocks can experience both capital appreciation and increasing dividend income streams, even in rising interest rate environments.', 'Click to continue reading and see 10 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.\xa0', 'Suggested articles:', '11 Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds', '15 Best 5G Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds', '11 Best April Dividend Stocks To Invest In', 'Disclosure.

If you want to skip our overview of the industrial sector, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Best Industrial Machinery Stocks to Invest in. ', 'The industrial machinery industry is one of the most capital intensive in the world. Setting up a firm that makes these machines is not an easy task, and it often requires years of expertise and hefty amounts of capital which until very recently were only available to sizeable nation states such as the United States and the Soviet Union.', 'Over the course of time, these companies, which often trace their roots back to the industrial boom in the U.S. during the second world war, have become private entities. At the same time, the high barriers of entry mean that not only are the top industrial machinery stocks among some of the most advanced companies in the world but also that these firms enjoy the comfort of economies of scale that are hard to compete with.', 'As an example, consider some of the most valuable industrial machinery stocks in terms of market capitalization. A couple of such firms are General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW), and Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN). General Electric, makes and sells some of the most advanced machines in the world. These include jet engines which are the backbone of the U.S. Air Force and nuclear reactors. These reactors are some of the most exacting engineered products on the planet due to the high stress environment in which they operate and the extreme catastrophe that awaits them should even the slightest thing go awry.', 'Similarly, Eaton plays an integral role in the global aviation supply chain. An average jet engine for a commercial airliner can contain as many as fifty thousand individual components, from high precision crystal fan blades to pipes, pumps, and hydraulic motors. All of these have to be kept in prime condition, and they are built to a standard that not many firms can achieve.', 'However, unlike high growth technology stocks, industrial machinery stocks are more down to Earth. Like their technology peers, their performance depends on interest rates since funding pricey manufacturing plants and other equipment requires loans. Similarly, the rosier the economic outlook is, the better industrial machinery stocks fare on the stock market since the demand for their products is assumed to be stable.', 'As an illustration of this aspect of industrial machinery stock performance, consider the shares of General Electric and Eaton. They bled as much as 51% of their share price value on the stock market after the coronavirus lockdowns were put into place, as investor outlook for the global economy darkened.', 'But what about recent stock performance? After all, investor expectations of an easing in interest rates could also generate tailwinds for industrial machinery stocks. 2024 has seen investors start off the year on an optimistic note for rate cuts, but settle with the knowledge that the Fed might take longer than they would like. Year to date, both GE and Eaton are up by 39% and 31%, respectively, with GE enjoying slightly higher returns in the wake of its announcement that it will split into two companies.', ""Analyzing industrial machinery stocks means that investors have to focus on their product portfolio and the potential to both reduce costs (often dubbed as 'improving margins') and gain market share. Both these themes were also present during the latest full hedge fund investor letter cycle which was for the fourth quarter of 2023."", 'For instance, Southeastern Asset Management mentioned General Electric in its investor letter for the period as it outlined:', 'General Electric - Industrial conglomerate General Electric (GE) was the top performer for the year. We exited this multi-year investment as its price went above our appraisal. In 1Q23, GE spun out GE Healthcare, which we sold as it traded at our value. The share price continued its strong performance throughout the spring and summer, and we ultimately sold the position in the third quarter when we no longer saw a margin of safety for the business. CEO Larry Culp was a great partner who created significant value for shareholders by reducing leverage, cutting costs, streamlining operations, improving company culture and simplifying the structure with plans to split the company into three businesses. We hope to have the opportunity to partner with him again in the future.', 'Artisan Partners was more detailed in its coverage of Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) when it shared:', 'Xylem is a global leader in water technology across pumps, smart meters and treatment services. More than 80% of the company’s sales come from markets where it maintains the No. 1 or No. 2 market position. Xylem’s pumps business (selling primarily to utilities) is a sticky and profitable operation that provides capital to invest in more innovative solutions, such as smart meters. In mid-2023, Xylem completed the acquisition of Evoqua, giving it a leading position in the US water treatment business. We believe the company is at the start of a compelling profit cycle. Smart meter sales are recovering from supply chain issues, cost and revenue synergies from the acquisition are in the early innings, and a newly hired (and well- respected) CFO should help catalyze long-awaited margin expansion. Meanwhile, rising demand for solutions to water sustainability challenges should persist as a strong trend for years to come.', 'Seems like smart money is, like always, aware of broader trends that could be helping industrial machinery stocks set themselves up for years of growth. Consequently, we decided to take a look at some such stocks and the notable names were Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH).', 'A factory floor filled with specialized drug manufacturing machinery and workers.', 'Our Methodology', 'To make our list of the best industrial machinery stocks, we ranked the most valuable specialty industrial machinery and heavy machinery stocks by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023 and picked out the top stocks.', 'For these best industrial machinery stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB)."", ""Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments."", ' View our latest analysis for Williams Companies ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Williams Companies is:', '23% = US$3.4b ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.23."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Williams Companies has a similar ROE to the average in the Oil and Gas industry classification (21%)."", ""So while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Williams Companies."", ""Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same."", 'Williams Companies does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.78. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.', ""Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

Since the tragic and deadly crashes of its aircraft in 2018, the company has been consistently in turmoil. Some events -- such as the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns -- were out of its control, but most of this has been self-inflicted. Airline customers and flyers are worried about the quality of its aircraft, and rightfully so, as we saw earlier this year when a door flew off an Alaska Airlines aircraft 10,000 feet in the sky.', ""It's now five years after the deadly 737 Max crashes and Boeing's quality control still can't seem to get on track. This is likely why we saw the company announce this week that the chief executive officer (CEO), chair of the board, and head of commercial airplanes will all be leaving the company."", ""Bringing in new leadership is huge news for Boeing. Here's what it could mean for the company and its beaten-down stock."", ""In a press release, Boeing announced three changes to its leadership team on March 25th. The chair of the board will be stepping down and is being replaced by Steve Mollenkopf, former CEO of Qualcomm and an engineer. In most situations, it wouldn't matter what educational background the board of directors has -- but in the case of Boeing I think it is important for the company to have as many engineers as possible at the helm to fix its quality control issues."", 'Second, Boeing announced it was replacing the head of its commercial airline division -- the segment where all these problems have occurred -- with Stephanie Pope, the current chief operating officer of Boeing (COO). Pope is a Boeing veteran who has worked in virtually every division at the company. Time will tell if she is the right person for the job, but it was clear that the current division leaders were not up to the task.', ""Speaking of which, CEO Dave Calhoun announced he was retiring at the end of 2024 as well. Hiring a CEO is different than most other roles, as it is the job of the board of directors. Boeing specifically will be looking for someone who can fix its quality control issues. One candidate could be the new CEO of Spirit Aeorosystems Patrick Shannahan. Shannahan was brought on to the troubled Boeing supplier in late 2023 and has a long history of working at Boeing. He also has worked in the Department of Defense (an important customer of Boeing) and has major ties to the state of Washington, where Boeing's manufacturing is mostly located."", 'Whoever the next CEO is, investors should have a watchful eye on the decision. Many analysts believe Calhoun was the wrong person for the job, as he came from a finance background and was not meant to lead an engineering and manufacturing behemoth such as Boeing.', 'From a business perspective, Boeing needs to get back to consistently generating cash flow. To do so, it will need to up the production rate for its commercial aircraft business. Before the 737 Max crashes, Boeing was generating more than $10 billion in free cash flow a year. Ever since, its production levels have dropped and its cash flow has suffered. It recovered a bit last year but looks poised to dip in 2024, with its production levels down once again. Boeing management already pulled its financial guidance after this latest Alaska Airlines incident.', 'Boeing has minimal competitive risks. As an American national champion with close to zero domestic competitors, customers will buy its aircraft if it can produce them in a timely manner with high-quality standards. At the end of the day, there are two things that matter for Boeing: high production levels and high-quality standards. If they can figure out both, the free cash flow should take care of itself.', ""Boeing's stock has unsurprisingly remained in the gutter for years. Today it is off 57% from all-time highs for a market cap of approximately $110 billion. It has a large debt pile of $36 billion that it had to take on during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a manageable debt position as long as the company starts generating consistent cash flow."", ""Again, it all comes back to increasing production. If Boeing can increase its annual production of commercial aircraft, it will likely start generating more than $10 billion in free cash flow each year, which can grow along with the global aviation market. This would give it a reasonably cheap valuation compared to its market cap of $110 billion and plenty of capital to pay back its $36 billion in net debt. It wouldn't be shocking to see a healthy Boeing generating $15 billion-$20 billion in annual profits in 2030."", ""If you believe Boeing can solve its production issues, the stock looks cheap here. But if it can't, the stock will likely do poorly over the next decade. This is why the new CEO and leadership team are important news for investors to follow."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Boeing right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Boeing, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Boeing wasn’t one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis on these formidable, well-trained units and head over directly to the 5 Most Elite US Military Special Forces and Their Role.', 'American special forces have captured the imagination of popular culture in the country for quite some time, and often bring to mind movies such as the Black Hawk Down, or video games like Call of Duty. There is immense prestige associated with these warrior units within the US military as well. These top-notched special forces are made up of some of the finest soldiers recruited from across the nation after a high level of rigorous training.', 'Special forces have historically worked in small units and were called in only for critical missions. However, since the advent of the war against terrorism, their role has significantly expanded. The United States Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, has grown from 38,000 personnel since the September 11 attacks in 2001 to 73,000 by 2020, with their budget also skyrocketing 495% from $2.3 billion to $13.7 billion during the period.', 'Given the complex challenges these special forces undertake, the US is equipping its units with sophisticated equipment to dominate the battlefield and defy challenges that come in their way. Last year in July, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) announced that Dry Combat Submersible (DCS) – a project it had been working on for several decades – had achieved initial operational capability.', 'Two of the three DCSs have already been provided by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to the military, which would enable the Navy SEALs to travel well below the surface of the ocean without wetsuits, as well as get in and out of the submersibles undetected while being entirely submerged. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a key industrial partner of US special operations forces, and is also the primary contractor for SOCOM’s logistics and sustainment support program.', 'Seabed capabilities of the American Navy are also being ramped up at a pace. As noted in a report in May 2023, the Navy has commissioned a next-generation attack submarine, for the Navy SEALs to perform covert operations along the floor of the ocean, such as retrieving parts of missiles and rockets tested underwater, and tapping deep sea communication cables. Work on the project is underway at General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD).', 'General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) had also previously been providing professional services to American military special forces for their global operations. The company had signed a five-year, $900 million contract with SOCOM between 2016 and 2021, which included services like technical support, engineering for major weapon systems, and assisting the units with decision making related to production and program control. ARMA Global, a subsidiary of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), executed work on the agreement.', 'On the other hand, SOCOM’s fleet of MH-47G Chinook helicopters is also being upgraded, for which The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) received a $271 million modification contract in December 2023. Under the agreement, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) will procure six MH-47G rotary wing renewal build aircraft for SOCOM. Work on the program is likely to be completed around mid-2027. Earlier last year, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) also won a task order, valued at $18 million, for the acquisition of components and parts for the aircraft.', 'Getmilitaryphotos/Shutterstock.com', 'Multiple sources were considered to develop consensus and rank the most elite US military special forces. These included Insider Monkey and Yahoo Finance’s recent article, 11 Countries with the Best Military Special Forces in the World, CBS News’ list of The most elite U.S. special forces, Special Ops Magazine’s 2022 List of Elite US Special Forces, Asymmetric Warfare Group’s write-up titled The most elite special operations forces in the US, and Business Insider’s piece on the most elite special forces units in the US.', 'We observed special forces units that received mention on these websites, and then ranked them based on their operational expertise and strategic importance.', 'If interested, you can also take a look at the 11 Countries with the Highest Number of Military Special Forces in the World.\xa0', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.', 'Let’s now take a look at the most elite US military special forces and their role.', 'The Special Operations Weather Technicians, abbreviated as SOWT, are meteorologists of the United States Air Force, with ground-combat training. These personnel are tasked with gathering intelligence from forward deployed locations related to weather and terrain, including oceans and rivers, in hostile territory, which assist in planning special-operation missions. The weather technicians are trained enough to accompany conventional military units in the battlefield as well. All special forces operations in the US are planned using the intelligence and coordination provided by the Special Operations Weather Technicians.', 'The Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen of the Navy are one of the most elite US military special forces. These units have amphibious mission expertise, with personnel trained to operate in challenging operations around rivers and coastal areas. These forces typically take part in operations that are spearheaded by the Navy SEALs, and focus on special weapons and tactics, infiltration, and exfiltration during combat. The Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen notably served in Operation Iraqi Freedom.', 'Next on our list of the most elite US military special forces is the Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team, abbreviated as FAST. The unit is part of the security force regiment of the Marine Corps, and is tasked with protecting sensitive naval installations, as well American diplomatic missions and embassies abroad. Other roles of the force include physical security, counter surveillance, and close quarter combat. This month, the United States Southern Command deployed the Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Team at the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.', 'The Marine Raiders are the combat units of the United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC), with its personnel trained in special reconnaissance, direct action, unconventional warfare, and foreign internal defense. The regiment comprises a headquarter company and three battalions, with each battalion then containing 4 Marine Special Operations Companies (MSOCs). The Marine Raiders were established during World War II to take part in amphibious warfare, and has since then being regarded among the top special forces in the United States.', 'Next up in the 11th spot is Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company, or ANGLICO, which is the airborne fire support unit of the Marine Corps. These special forces are recognized for being the only full-time firepower control team under the Department of Defense that is capable of coordinating fire support from air, land, and sea. ANGLICO’s personnel receive training in close air support, ground-based fire support, and are known for their prowess in cannon, rocket artillery, and precision-guided munitions. It is among the most elite US military special forces.', 'The 75th Ranger Regiment is an elite, airborne-qualified light infantry special forces unit under the command of the US Army, that support forces like Delta, and can also conduct raids on enemy targets themselves. It takes one year of training for new recruits to become an Army Ranger. Some of the courses and qualifications these personnel go through include combat diving, military freefall, parachuting, survival escape, and mountain warfare among others.', 'The Air Force Combat Controllers are among the top special forces units in the United States. The unit holds expertise in stealth insertion behind enemy lines and often coordinates attacks by ground troops by providing them air support. Their personnel are skilled in air traffic control, fire support, command and control, and communications. It takes 2 years of rigorous training to join the combat control team, with between 90-95% of the initial applicants missing out due to self-eliminations, injuries, and academic failures. According to the Asymmetric Warfare Group, the Air Force Combat Control Team likely played a role in the Libyan Revolution against Gaddafi’s regime.\xa0', 'The USAF’s Pararescuemen are highly-trained personnel who go well behind enemy lines and rescue lost men. Their role is different from the combat control team in the sense that their responsibility is to rescue, not offensive operations. Despite that, the pararescue force is well equipped and skilled to face enemy combatants on the ground through guerilla tactics and specialized small unit attacks. These pararescuemen experience rigorous training in parachuting, combat diving, basic survival, underwater missions, paramedic training, and specialized courses in pararescue recovery before joining the force.', 'The Green Berets are the US Army Special Forces, comprising versatile troops with expertise in unconventional warfare, special reconnaissance, direct action, counter-terrorism, and counter proliferation, among others. The Green Berets were among the first military units to enter Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks, and have played an active role in several American military operations and wars over the years, including in Laos, Vietnam, El Salvador, Kuwait, and Iraq.', 'Next up is Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance, a special operations force with the primary responsibility to gather intelligence required for the Marine Corps to conduct their missions. The unit also has a direct action role and has expertise in covert maritime infiltration. Some of the responsibilities of the Force Recon include scout swimming, coastline reconnaissance, maritime interdiction, and direct action where required. Their personnel are trained in parachuting, skiing, and amphibious techniques.', 'Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Elite US Military Special Forces and Their Role.', 'Suggested Articles:', '15 Countries that have the Most F-16 Fighter Jets', '15 Countries that will have the Most Powerful Militaries by 2030', '16 Strongest Navies in the World in 2024', 'Disclosure: None. 15 Most Elite US Military Special Forces and Their Role is originally published on Insider Monkey.']"

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$1.46b', 'US$1.35b', 'US$1.56b', 'US$1.81b', 'US$2.02b', 'US$2.18b', 'US$2.32b', 'US$2.43b', 'US$2.53b', 'US$2.63b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x9', 'Analyst x10', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 7.87%', 'Est @ 6.20%', 'Est @ 5.03%', 'Est @ 4.20%', 'Est @ 3.63%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% ', 'US$1.4k', 'US$1.2k', 'US$1.3k', 'US$1.4k', 'US$1.4k', 'US$1.4k', 'US$1.4k', 'US$1.4k', 'US$1.3k', 'US$1.3k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$13b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

Do keep this in mind.', ""The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Quanta Services as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.081. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

While 2023 was a year of struggle for most industries, including the semiconductor industry, 2024 promises a growth spurt. This March, KPMG released its Global Semiconductor Industry Outlook for 2024, where it noted some of the key things to look forward to when it comes to semiconductors while highlighting significant challenges posing a threat to this space. KPMG surveyed 172 semiconductor executives for its report, 85% of whom stated that they anticipate the industry to see double-digit revenue growth in 2024. The main growth drivers for the semiconductor industry today continue to be the automotive industry, artificial intelligence, and microprocessors. While these trends and developments continue to propel semiconductors upward, a majority of semiconductor executives believe that there is a lack of skilled talent in the industry, which poses a significant risk to its growth.', ""Perhaps the most significant recent event in the semiconductor industry was the GTC Conference hosted by semiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), this March. The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, made several major announcements in his keynote at the conference, but perhaps the most anticipated and exciting one was the unveiling of the company's latest chip, the Blackwell, named after David Blackwell, who was the first African American inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, and the first African American tenured professor at the University of California, Berkeley. In his announcement during his keynote, Huang compared the Blackwell chip to its predecessor, the Hopper, which had been the most advanced GPU in the world before the Blackwell's creation. Huang highlighted that the Blackwell chip comprises 208 billion transistors, followed by these comments on the chip:"", '""There\'s a small line between two dyes. This is the first time two dyes have been abutted like this together, in such a way that the two dyes think it\'s one chip. There\'s 10 terabytes of data between it, 10 terabytes per second, so that these two sides of the Blackwell chip have no clue which side they\'re on. There\'s no memory locality issues, no cache issues, it\'s just one giant chip. And so, when we were told that Blackwell\'s ambitions were beyond the limits of physics, the engineer said \'so what?\' And so this is what happened.""', 'With the introduction of this new chip in the semiconductor space, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has marked itself as the leader in the industry, way ahead of other notable and successful competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Nike is the clear leader in the athletic footwear niche, after all, and Lululemon has a bright long-term outlook as it pushes into new geographies and product categories.', ""But one stock will be a better fit in most investors' growth-focused portfolios. Let's look at which one is the more attractive buy right now."", ""Investors were disappointed with both companies' late-March earnings updates, yet Nike's performance reflected deeper challenges in the footwear industry. Sales were flat at $12.4 billion, with essentially zero growth in its stores and online selling channel. There's no quick answer to these challenges, either, which are being driven by weaker demand trends and a desire by Nike's retailing partners to slash inventory levels."", 'That\'s why management recently announced a restructuring program aimed at cutting costs. ""We are making the necessary adjustments to drive Nike\'s next chapter of growth,"" CEO John Donahoe said in a press release.', 'Lululemon\'s expansion rate is far stronger, with sales jumping 16% to $3.2 billion over the holiday-season quarter.

""We are pleased with our strong finish to the 2023 fiscal year,"" CEO Calvin McDonald told investors on March 21.', ""Lululemon compares favorably against Nike on its finances, too, despite its much smaller sales footprint and its relatively weaker market position.

Below, we break down some things you may have missed during the week, and what we’re still thinking about.', 'From a Liquid Death beauty tie-up to a possible good omen at Nike, here’s our closeout for the week.', 'Overstock.com is back in business, partnership with X planned ', 'Beyond Inc. has relaunched Overstock.com. In a Thursday announcement, the company said the site is offering “crazy good deals” of up to 30% to 70% off. The online retailer will include categories of furniture, rugs and jewelry, and in the coming months, it plans to add additional product categories.', '“The relaunch of Overstock.com comes at a time of significant growth and innovation for the company, as it continues to expand its product offerings, invest in technology, and put our customers and vendors as our priority,” Beyond Inc.’s executive chairman Marcus Lemonis said in a statement. ', 'Also this week, Beyond, whose portfolio includes Bed Bath & Beyond and Zulily, said it has entered a strategic partnership with social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. The company said Wednesday that the deal will generate custom short- and long-form content for Beyond, develop customer acquisition and retention strategies, and highlight the retailer’s brands on events and holidays. ', 'A positive sign for Nike’s innovation pipeline?', 'Nike’s promise to return to its product innovation roots could be off to a good start, according to a Wedbush analyst note. The analysts, led by Tom Nikic, noted that Nike’s Air Max DN debuted in multiple colorways on Tuesday and sold out on the retailer’s website.', 'That comes after a somewhat somber earnings call last week in which Nike CEO John Donahoe said the business was “not performing at our potential” and announced a series of strategy pivots to get the brand back on track. Among them was a plan to accelerate product innovation, including by investing more in design, product creation and other departments, as well as pulling forward some product innovations by more than a year.', 'A solid innovation pipeline is doubly important for Nike right now, since the company is facing headwinds around some of its older styles, Nikic said. The sellout of the Air Max DN could be a good omen since Nike “has been off their game” for a while and “desperately need a hot new product,” according to Nikic. The analyst noted that it was also product innovation that got Nike out of its last rut around 2016.', ""“Thus, we see the successful initial launch as a positive data point for the brand,” Nikic said. “We'd note, however, that for a company of [Nike]'s size (over $50 billion of revenue annually), one sneaker won't move the needle all that much, so they will need to continue bringing innovative new products to the market.”"", 'Miniso opens second Times Square location', 'Miniso opened a pop-up shop in New York City’s Times Square next to the Disney store on Saturday, according to a press release. This is the brand’s second location in the shopping district after opening its first Times Square global flagship in May last year.', '""We\'re thrilled to be opening this new pop-up in Times Square,"" Miniso U.S. general manager Tyrone Li said in a statement. ""Our flagship store here has been a massive hit, breaking numerous brand records and proving a popular addition for Miniso joy-seekers. This new pop-up is a playful and innovative reimagining of our \'Joy Philosophy\' that highlights our outstanding range of IP products and is sure to add even more energy to this buzzing location.""', 'The new location features plushies from collaborations like Sanrio, Snoopy, Winnie the Pooh and Minions. The pop-up has already reached record sales figures in the three weeks since its initial soft opening early March, according to the company.', 'The second Times Square location achieved the highest sales per square-foot record among all the U.S. stores, with its sales performance ranking in the top three. In December, Miniso opened its 100th store in the U.S. The company now operates120 stores in over 20 states.', 'Lilly Pulitzer adds 3 collections at Pottery Barn', 'Pottery Barn plans to introduce three new collections in collaboration with Lilly Pulitzer. The collections will include outdoor accessories, towels, bedding, decor and some furniture, the company said Tuesday. All of the items will be available exclusively at Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids and Pottery Barn Teen.', 'The new collections feature Lilly Pulitzer’s signature playful colors and patterns, and they’re produced with sustainably made materials. The collection also includes outdoor towels, pillows and pool loungers. The collections are available now in Pottery Barn brands’ online stores.', '“We’re thrilled to expand upon our partnership with the iconic Lilly Pulitzer brand for all ages of Pottery Barn brand customers,” Pottery Barn Brands CEO Marta Benson said in a statement. “Building on the success of our debut collaboration in 2018, our teams have come together to deliver new collections that celebrate the resort-style luxury and fun spirit of the beloved Lilly Pulitzer lifestyle.”', 'Last week, Lilly Pulitzer and Badgley Mischka announced a collab on a seven-piece capsule collection of dresses ranging from $485 to $715 that were set to debut this week through both brands’ online stores, along with some Lilly Pulitzer stores and Badgley Mischka’s two boutiques.', 'Liquid Death and E.l.f. Cosmetics release coffin makeup collection', 'E.l.f. Cosmetics newest makeup collaboration is what some might say is to die for. E.l.f. and beverage brand Liquid Death on Tuesday launched a limited-edition, black-metal inspired makeup collection, according to a press release. Valued at $34, the Corpse Paint Vault includes five items and comes in a keepsake coffin.', '“When you set out to create a different kind of company, it\'s important to align yourself with like-minded kindred spirits. We are both challenger brands on a one-way path to disruption,"" E.l.f. Beauty\'s Chief Marketing Officer Kory Marchisotto said in a statement. “E.l.f. and Liquid Death share a passion for self-expression and unexpected creativity. We’ve had a lot of fun — and a lot of laughter — bringing Corpse Paint to life. Pun intended.”', 'To create the corpse paint look, E.l.f’s set includes its matte setting spray, its satin lipstick in the shade All Night, the no budge cream eyeshadow in Wispy Cloud, its waterproof eyeliner pen and putty applicator.', '$73B', 'That’s what ThredUp predicts the secondhand market in the U.S. will reach by 2028. That figure is notably less than the resale platform’s prediction last year of the market reaching $82 billion by 2026. ThredUp also predicts that the global secondhand apparel market will reach $350 billion by 2028, according to its latest resale report.', 'In 2023, the used clothing market in the U.S. reached $43 billion. That compares to about $23 billion in 2018.', '$18.25B', 'That’s how much The Home Depot intends to pay to acquire building product supplier SRS Distribution. The deal is expected to close at the end of this fiscal year.', 'Home Depot said the acquisition will allow it to boost business with its pro customers. SRS Distribution currently serves professional roofing, landscaping and pool contractors.', 'The acquisition will also grow Home Depot’s total addressable market by $50 billion to reach about $1 trillion, the home improvement retailer said Thursday.', 'Off-pricers get another boost, this time from Macy’s', 'Off-price retailers had a good holiday. Quarterly net sales at TJX, which runs T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and others, rose 13% year over year to $16.4 billion, with comps up 5% for both the quarter and the year. At Burlington, Q4 net sales rose 13.9% to $3.1 billion, with comps up 2%. And at Ross, net sales in the period rose 15.5% to $6 billion, with comps up 7%.', 'All of these companies benefited from an extra week during the holidays, which will disappear this year. But they’ll be getting another boost in 2024, and over the next three years, as Macy’s closes 150 underperforming stores, according to analysts at Jeffries and Earnest Analytics. Both see TJX, and especially its T.J. Maxx and Marshalls businesses, as benefiting the most. Jeffries research found significant geographic overlap between TJX and Macy’s stores, and analysts there see “a few billions of dollars of share gain opportunity” for the off-price leader.', 'This story was originally published on Retail Dive.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Countries with the Highest Age Dependency Ratio in the World.', 'As reported by UNCTAD, there were 54 children or older people for every 100 individuals of working age in 2022. All of the top 30 countries that recorded the highest age dependency ratios were situated in Africa, with a high child dependency being the primary driver. On the other extreme, economies on the Arabian Peninsula and in the Caribbean had low age dependency ratios.', 'Generally, age dependency ratios initially tend to decrease before increasing as a larger population approaches an age above 64. This initial decline in the age dependency ratios has occurred in most regions of the world. Age dependency ratios are already increasing in developed economies and have been forecasted to reach 73% by 2050. However, the decrease in age dependency will continue in Africa even after 2050.', 'The age structure also varies between the developed and developing nations. Developed economies have relatively smaller young age cohorts. The largest age groups in such economies are those aged between 35 and 54 years. On the contrary, developing countries have older age classes smaller than their younger classes.', 'As compared to the rest of the world, Africa’s population is younger. As reported by the US Census Bureau, only 5.6% of Africa’s population was above 60 years of age in 2020, as compared to 23.4% in North America. Although the share of adults in the total population across Africa is less, these adults still account for a high number. In 2020, 18 African countries had more than 1 million people aged above 60. Furthermore, the population over 60 in Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to rise from 50 million in 2020 to 600 million by 2100. This implies that the old-age dependency ratio, the proportion of elderly individuals relative to the working-age population, is set to increase in the region.', 'Fertility tends to influence the age structure across countries. Many sub-Saharan African countries have high fertility levels which impacts their age structure for instance Uganda has one of the lowest median ages in the world. Tunisia in Northern Africa has witnessed a decline in fertility and hence, the median age in the country is comparatively higher. Low median ages also indicate a higher dependency ratio where the working-age population is relatively younger and the older and younger populations depend on them.', 'Africa remains subjected to poor health conditions among its adults as compared to high-income and even other low- or middle-income countries since the region allocates a limited share of GDP to health. As reported by the National Bureau of Economic Research, the elderly in Africa tend to be disproportionately impacted by non-communicable conditions since 80% of health budgets go to infectious diseases. Older people in African countries such as Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda are deprived of accessing healthcare facilities. 30% of the region’s elderly population is a victim of an illness or injury that has halted regular activities including work for them.', 'Life expectancy as well as the health conditions for the elderly around the world have significantly improved as a result of healthcare companies such as AstraZeneca plc (NASDAQ:AZN), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) making advancements. Let’s take a look at what these companies have been up to.', 'AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is a renowned biopharmaceutical company that operates in more than 100 countries across the world. The company recently made a development in regards to HR-positive breast cancer, \xa0the most common breast cancer subtype globally. On March 27, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) reported that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW) has approved its Truqap in combination with Faslodex for adult patients with advanced HR-positive breast cancer. The approval was granted based on a trial that showed that Truqap plus Faslodex decreased the risk of disease progression or death by 50% as compared to Faslodex alone.', 'Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is another known global healthcare company that caters to serious chronic diseases. The firm continues to target widespread adult diseases including diabetes through innovation. On March 21, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) reported that Awiqli has been recommended for approval by the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Awiqli is a once-weekly basal insulin icodec that has been made to treat diabetes in adults by covering the basal insulin requirements for a week with a single subcutaneous injection.', 'Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) manufactures medicines and vaccines that cater to oncology, cardiology, immunology, and neurology. On February 19, the company reported that VELSIPITY has been given marketing authorization by the European Commission (EC) for the treatment of patients aged 16 years and above in the EU with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. Previously, VELSIPITY from Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Now that we have analyzed the age structures around the world and the factors contributing to them, let’s move to the 20 countries with the highest age dependency in the world.', '20 Largest Economies in Africa Ranked by PPP', 'Our Methodology:', 'In order to compile a list of the 20 countries with the highest age dependency in the world, we sourced data from the World Bank.

As stock prices rise, genuine bargains are becoming tougher to come by.', 'However, there are still a few stocks that look like great deals. AT&T (NYSE: T) and International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) have rallied along with the market, but the stocks offer great value to investors hunting for bargains.', 'AT&T is not the same company it was a few years ago. The telecom giant tried and failed to turn itself into a media conglomerate, snapping up media companies and racking up monstrous debt in the process. Undoing the damage has taken time, but AT&T has now mostly rid itself of everything outside of its core wireless and wireline businesses.', 'Debt levels remain a sticking point, but AT&T is successfully ramping up its free-cash-flow generation even as it invests heavily in 5G and fiber.

The company tacked on 1.7 million net postpaid phone subscribers in 2023, and the mobility segment reported its best-ever operating income. On the wireline side, AT&T grew fiber revenue by 27% and added 1.1 million net new subscribers.', ""Based on the midpoint of AT&T's free-cash-flow guidance, the stock trades for a pittance.

But with the media distraction gone and the company fully focused on the wireless and fiber businesses, AT&T stock can deliver impressive returns for investors as the cloud of pessimism is lifted."", ""Major enterprises and organizations, particularly those operating in heavily regulated industries, face unique challenges when adopting AI technology. Customer and proprietary data must be protected, regulations must be adhered to, and risks must be minimized. As powerful as advanced AI models have become, they're still prone to a variety of problems including hallucinations and spitting out training data."", ""IBM has a solution in the form of watsonx, the tech giant's enterprise AI platform. Customers can train, validate, and deploy generative AI models, store the massive amount of data involved in training AI models, and monitor AI applications to make sure they don't go off the rails."", 'IBM is still in the early innings of turning watsonx into a major business, but the results so far are positive. The amount of booked business related to generative AI had reached the low hundreds of millions of dollars by the end of the third quarter, not long after the components of watsonx began becoming available. That amount doubled by the end of the fourth quarter as demand remained strong.', ""IBM's secret weapon is its consulting business, which is responsible for driving about two-thirds of generative AI business. Enterprises need a capable AI platform, but they also need guidance, expertise, and integrated solutions. IBM can deliver all of the above."", ""IBM stock has rallied recently, so it's not nearly as cheap as it was even a year ago. But with free cash flow expected to come in around $12 billion this year, a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio below 15 seems like a steal. IBM is positioning itself to be the enterprise AI leader, a long-term opportunity likely measured in the billions of dollars."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in AT&T right now?', 'Before you buy stock in AT&T, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and AT&T wasn’t one of them.

Also, gains from favorable ocean freight rates, lower inventory provisions, and decreased distribution and freight costs have been contributing to its margins and overall profitability.Buoyed by such strengths, shares of this apparel and related products dealer have gained 22.8% against the industry’s 3.8% drop over the past six months. A VGM Score of A further adds strength to this current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Analysts seem quite optimistic about the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales and earnings per share (EPS) is currently pegged at $3 billion and $6.45, respectively. These estimates reflect corresponding growth of 1.6% and 4.2% year over year. The consensus mark for 2025 sales and EPS is $3.1 billion and $6.81, respectively, showing year-over-year increases of 3.5% and 5.7%."", ""Carter's has made significant efforts in pricing to address the market conditions and enhance profitability. The company is seeing improved price realization and profit margins primarily due to the strength of its product offerings and lower ocean freight rates, along with better inventory management."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', ""Additionally, the company is focused on essential core products, especially in the inflationary markets. This focus, coupled with a compelling value proposition, wherein average retail price points are around $11, makes Carter's an attractive option for budget-conscious consumers. The company’s pricing strategy involves keeping its brands competitively priced, usually within $1 or $2 of private label brands, which has proven effective in maintaining competitiveness in the market.Although Carter’s has been witnessing the impacts of inflation and consequently reduced consumer spending, the demand trends in the wholesale segment have been showing improvement. Its wholesale segment has been gaining from leaner inventories with wholesale customers since the start of 2023. As a result, CRI experienced higher-than-planned demand in its wholesale business for the fifth consecutive quarter in the fourth quarter of 2023.Looking ahead, Carter's anticipates lower product costs, which are expected to enable it to strengthen its product offerings and sharpen price points, thereby improving profitability. Management envisions an improved demand trend and a better macroeconomic landscape as the year progresses, with sales and earnings increases weighted to the second half. CRI anticipates continued conservative inventory commitments by wholesale customers and gross margin expansion on lower ocean freight rates and product costs, and higher margin retail sales.On a concluding note, Carter’s seems to be a decent investment bet given the aforementioned positives."", 'Some better-ranked companies are Ralph Lauren RL, Royal Caribbean RCL and lululemon athletica LULU.Ralph Lauren, a footwear and accessories dealer, sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), at present.

It’s too complex and subjective a job for any AI model, they said. Fast forward a few months, more and more investment experts and firms are deploying AI for stock picking. Bloomberg in February reported that Vanguard Group was using AI in several of its products that use quant investing techniques. Among the funds where Vanguard has deployed machine learning models include the Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund, the Vanguard Strategic Small-Cap Equity Fund and the Vanguard Market Neutral Fund. The Bloomberg report said that the Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund and the Strategic Small-Cap Fund beat their benchmarks and outperformed industry peers last year.', 'Machine learning and algorithms have long been at play in the investing game for quant funds. But the generative AI boom is making the power of mathematical, AI-powered analysis available for everyone. Using AI in investing would no longer be limited to quant funds. Financial services company Mercer conducted a survey to find out the penetration of AI among investment managers across its Global Investment Manager Database. Nine out of 10 surveyed managers said they are already using or planning to use AI in their investment process. A whopping 54% of the investment managers said they are already using AI to assist their decision making, while 37% plan to use the technology in the near future.', 'Mercer said in its report that the investment managers it surveyed said that the use of AI would give a whopping $14 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030.', 'Since generative AI and machine learning in investing is currently in its early stages, there are some challenges for investment managers who are trying to use the technology to their advantage. Data quality and data availability are among the biggest challenges these managers are facing.', 'But robots are not taking over the investing game (for now). Almost no one in the survey said they are completely outsourcing the investing-related decision-making to AI. They are using AI-powered models just for assistance, idea generation, data analysis and other important tasks in the investing process. Final decision-making still rests with humans. The report added:', '“Just a small minority of managers report fully automated statistical, ML and DL models, reinforcing AI and ML technologies as tools that support managers, rather than replacing the role of manager judgment and intervention. Among managers currently using AI, around one in 10 report full automation of statistical models (11%), ML (14%) and DL models (6%), while a third report infrequent monitoring of these processes (33%, 32% and 33%, respectively). Across all three areas, a significant proportion of current AI processes remain reliant on constant human intervention, reinforcing the role of AI and ML technologies as a supportive “tool” rather than a direct replacement of humans across the investment process.”', 'Methodology', 'This article is a performance evaluation of the stocks recommended by ChatGPT last year. We wanted to see whether ChatGPT is any good at stock picking. For that we reverted to our experiment with ChatGPT conducted in March 2023 where we asked ChatGPT to recommend some stocks that would make one rich over the next 10 years. We also consulted Finder.com’s experiment with AI in which researchers at the comparison website asked ChatGPT to create a “portfolio of stocks from high-quality businesses with criteria taken from the leading 10 funds it is competing against.” This portfolio was also created back in March 2023.\xa0 In this article we picked 14 stocks from these two ChatGPT-recommended portfolios with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:', '“Tesla, Inc.\xa0(NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle manufacturer with a significant technological lead in its large and rapidly growing addressable market. Tesla is a transportation company that is setting the pace for industry innovation, in our view.

However, the company noted that they remain confident by the amount of data that Tesla’s established and growing fleet of vehicles has gathered, which may bode well for the company’s full self-driving capabilities.”', 'Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +11%', ""Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares have gained about 11% since March 16, 2023, when ChatGPT recommended the stock to Insider Monkey’s researchers when they asked the chatbot to suggest stocks that have the potential to make one rich.

As has been the case for many years now, the scalable nature of the business allows for revenue growth to outpace its costs, which places the company in a good position to navigate through this inflationary period. The network continues to grow, with credentials and merchant locations up 7% and 17%, respectively. Cross-border travel-related spend also maintained its robust growth, increasing 26% year-on-year while Visa Direct reported 7.5 billion transactions, up 19% yearon-year, progressing on penetrating categories such as cross-border remittances. Altogether, we’re pleased with how the business is tracking and remain positive on Visa’s outlook.”', 'Stock Performance Since ChatGPT Recommended The Stock Last Year: +29%', 'When finder.com asked ChatGPT to make a market-beating stock portfolio back in March 2023, the LLM included Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) in the list of its stock recommendations.

As the digital advertising market recovered over the course of the year, revenue growth in Google’s advertising business accelerated from 3% in Q1 2023 to 10% in Q4 2023. Moreover, the company realized significant progress on its substantial margin expansion opportunity and maintained a robust capital return program. In 2023, operating profit margins expanded by approximately 225 basis points (bps), excluding one-time severance and real estate charges, as the Cloud segment reached breakeven profitability.

Over the last few months, however, inflation numbers have started stagnating. Latest data indicates that even though inflation was clocked at 3.2% in February, up slightly from 3.1% at the end of January, the annual rate of inflation actually slipped from 3.9% at the end of January to 3.8% at the end of last month. The central bank aims to bring this number down to around 2% and pave the way to a loosening of monetary policy.\xa0', 'Coupled with the resilience in the labor market, financial experts predict that positive growth numbers from the end of 2023 extend the runway for the central bank to act to bring down rates. Torsten Slok, the chief economist at private equity firm Apollo Global, recently told Financial Times that if the financial conditions continued to ease like they had done over the past few months, growth will likely remain strong, He also forecast that such conditions would allow the Federal Reserve to delay rate cuts. Ellen Zentner, the chief US economist at investment advisory Morgan Stanley, echoed these comments, noting that strong growth would extend the runway the Fed has to act over rate cuts.\xa0', 'Despite uncertainty regarding financial policy, investors at the stock market have been bullish on the health of the US economy.

Here is what the fund said:', '“Citigroup (“Citi”) is a large-capitalization global diversified financial services holding company that primarily serves multinational institutional and high net worth consumer clients. Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.', 'Citi’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion.

Traditionally Booking helps users find the right hotel by offering a search engine to define which city you want to stay in and apply various filters to narrow down the hotel options. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, a user can use natural language such as “plan a road trip on Route 66, starting in Chicago and ending to Los Angeles.” The Trip Planner then engages with the user like a travel agent, suggesting which cities to stay in each night and various sights to see along the way. Once the trip is planned out, the user can use natural language to generate hotel options, such as by writing “My budget is $200 to $300 a night. It will be my husband and I traveling together.”', 'Booking’s experiments in AI demonstrate the value of proprietary data sets. While general AI systems such as ChatGPT are designed to answer questions about anything, focused AI systems that leverage a company’s unique data can be far more powerful when applied to specific use cases.

To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market news, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now.', ""Investing in growth stocks is a good way to bolster your portfolio with high-profit names. Traditionally, growth stocks are companies that quickly grow their sales and earnings relative to the market, making them highly attractive to investors. But on the flipside, these stocks typically have incredibly high valuations and P/E ratios, which may discourage some investors looking for less expensive stocks. However, if you're an investor who is willing to commit to a higher valuation in exchange for quick profits and gains, growth stocks may be the best for you."", ""Last year, growth stocks outperformed the S&P 500 by a large margin. According to a Bloomberg article published this January, the S&P 500 Growth Index actually saw gains of 30% for 2023 compared to the broader benchmark index's 22% gain for the year. This performance came as a shock to many investors, considering the fact that the Federal Reserve was on a rate-hiking journey for most of the year, and traditionally, growth is expected to underperform in periods of rising interest rates. This stellar performance has resulted in growth stocks acquiring somewhat of a reliable appearance, leading to many investors in 2024 continuing to stick with their growth picks over their value counterparts."", 'For example, UBP\'s Head of Equity Research for Asia, Kieran Calder, joined Bloomberg on January 3 and stated that US growth stocks are at present a ""better bet"" for investors, with Calder himself preferring growth over value stocks in 2024. One of the major growth sectors in the market today is the technology sector with its exponential growth in light of the rise of artificial intelligence. According to Calder, for investors today, the following are the places to be in high-growth tech:', '""One is the Magnificent Seven, and we think these should probably be core holdings in a portfolio, but we also expect kind of a broadening out into, let\'s say, software names within tech, which have underperformed over the court of last year. But we\'ll be able to use and get improved earnings on the back of implementation of AI, for example, and more cloud adoption. So we think that the second tier of cloud and AI names is a good place to start to look for more ideas within US tech.""', ""In keeping with the above, our list of the best growth stocks to buy today also has several major tech names in it, such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). For growth investors looking to identify key investment areas within tech, it would be necessary to first identify the main themes within the tech sector in terms of what will drive the sector's growth the most in 2024 and beyond. According to BlackRock Active Equity Group's Ben Bei, there are three major themes in this sector: AI, cloud computing, and electric and autonomous vehicles. These areas offer the most interesting investment opportunities for investors today and are thus worth taking a look at."", 'When most investors think about growth stocks, especially in the tech sector, what comes to mind is usually large or mega-cap stocks with enormous valuations and market capitalizations. However, the trend in growth stock performance this year is showing that even small-cap growth stocks are on the rise and are performing spectacularly. On February 29, Fairlead Strategies\' Founder and Managing Partner, Katie Stockton, joined CNBC\'s ""Last Call"" to offer some insights on this development. Here\'s what she said:', '""We\'ve seen very concentrated outperformance in the small-cap arena from growth stocks, so more than just Supermicro and Viking Therapeutics. We have broad participation from growth more broadly and that includes a lot of biotechnology stocks, a lot of technology stocks, and I actually see that as a risk on move. A risk on indication shows an appetite for these names that previously were out of favor. You could say that about even the Russell 2000 Index, that the small-cap benchmark had been out of favor for some time. And now it\'s showing some signs of life and relative strength, when you compare it to the S&P 500.""', 'This improvement in the performance of small-cap growth stocks alongside the usual suspects is proving to be encouraging for investors. As such, many investors are looking for some of the best growth stocks to buy, which is why we have compiled our list below. Our list of the best growth stocks includes some of the best stocks for long-term growth and some of the fastest growing technology companies in the US today.', 'A close-up of a portfolio of stocks, emphasizing the broad equity portfolio of the company.', 'Our Methodology', ""For our list of the best growth stocks to invest in now, we consulted the holdings of the Vanguard Growth ETF.

V recently unveiled three AI-powered risk and fraud prevention solutions, which are expected to be launched in the first half of 2024 and will form part of the end-to-end Visa Protect portfolio. Visa Protect comes under the extensive value-added services suite of Visa, through which it offers issuing solutions, acceptance solutions, risk and identity solutions, and open banking solutions as well as advisory services. ', 'The three newly announced solutions have been built leveraging V’s profound expertise in AI. The first one, named Visa Deep Authorization, is a transaction risk scoring solution that provides better management of card-not-present (CNP) payments and relieves issuers of headwinds related to continuously evolving digital fraud. All this is done without causing any disturbance to a digital transaction.', 'Visa has broadened the scope of its AI-powered fraud risk management tools, Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager, in a bid to support non-Visa card transactions. This expansion enables issuers to consolidate their fraud detection efforts into one solution, thus enhancing fraud defense mechanisms and lowering operational costs, regardless of the network scheme used.', 'The third solution is a pioneering fraud prevention solution, customized for instant payment processes, such as peer-to-peer digital wallets, account-to-account transfers, and instant payment systems managed by central banks. The solution has been devised by V using advanced deep learning AI and produces a real-time risk score that enables the timely identification and automatic termination of fraudulent transactions, before their occurrence, by financial institutions.', 'Therefore, the ulterior motive behind the recent move remains to minimize fraud in case of immediate account-to-account and CNP payments, and also extend a shield to transactions taking place both within and outside Visa’s network. Additionally, the latest announcement also reflects Visa’s sincere efforts to bolster its risk and fraud solutions suite, and subsequently, upgrade its global value-added services portfolio, which has eventually grown to include around 200 products.', 'Portfolio upgradation often results in new customers and the likewise may happen with Visa, thereby fetching it higher data processing revenues in the days ahead. This revenue component is derived from the utilization of value-added services linked with issuing, acceptance, and risk and identity solutions. Data processing revenues improved 14% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.', 'Also, demand for the new solutions is likely to remain solid in the days ahead, considering a rapidly expanding digital era. While digitization does provide comfort and ease, the trend to go digital also invites sophisticated forms of digital fraud that can result in the compromise of payments received by organizations and the breach of customers’ confidential data. Thus, there is an alarming concern for businesses of all sizes and Visa can prudently capitalize on the dire need to create a safe payment ecosystem with the new additions to the Visa Protect suite.

It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Verizon Communications, it has a TSR of -7.8% for the last 5 years.

They said that AI will reshape retail through personalized experiences owing to data analysis. Advanced algorithms will deliver tailored recommendations and promotions and that will improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. Additionally, AI will help with the seamless integration of online and offline channels, which will make transitions for shoppers much easier. This can enhance convenience and flexibility and encourage customers to engage with retailers across various platforms. As CEO of Levi Strauss & Co.

But I think where the technology is going to go is it’s going to be able to leap into something like, to go from you’re a 501 shopper to this is going to be the perfect denim skirt for you and make bolder leaps, but do it in a way that’s informed based on your shopping history and who you are.”', 'The executives also stated that sustainability and inclusivity are some of the top priorities in retail, with a focus on inclusive sizing and sustainable practices like using eco-friendly materials and ethical sourcing.

On the positive side, discount retail due to its trade-down feature tends to be a defensive business during economic slowdowns. Dollar General has a strong market position and faces less competition than other discounters due to its largely rural footprint. The business’s value proposition is everyday low prices, a convenient format and proximity. The company has leverage due to capital expenditures, but interest coverage of ~9X is strong.

', ""Just like in 2023 and 2022, the stock market of 2024 is focused on the Federal Reserve. Now that investors are finished with the euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence stocks, and are happy with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s latest supply and pricing details for the Blackwell artificial intelligence processors, they can now turn their focus back on what the Fed might or might not do later this year."", 'This macro trend can very well decide which stocks are hot or not. This is because high interest rates mean that high growth firms find it difficult to raise capital and the opportunity costs for investors to pile their money into speculative investments also go up. One of the strongest examples of this trend is stocks in the clean energy sector. Before the coronavirus pandemic, clean energy was one of the hottest sectors in the world with investors rushing in hand over fist. However, now that interest rates are high, clean energy stocks are in a bear market if we consider the 12-month performance of the S&P Global Clean Energy Index. The index of clean energy stocks is down by nearly 27% over the past twelve months, and it is one of the strongest examples of potentially hot stocks if the Federal Reserve changes its course of action on interest rates.', ""So much so that investors have discovered that by betting on clean energy stocks, they can end up 'playing' the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. What this means is that if markets decide that the Fed will cut interest rates, then stocks such as those in the clean energy sector will see their prices appreciate on the back of bullish bets such as easy money being available for financing pricey projects such as wind power plants and solar farms."", ""For hot stocks, which are typically seeing higher trading volume and volatility than other stocks, a timely investment decision can yield benefits. In fact, we don't have to look too far to see how this has played out on the market.

Back then, the stock was trading for $120, meaning that the current trading price of $907 is beyond what most NVIDIA investors might have imagined would have been possible with their shares. Yet, even though NVIDIA's triple digit percentage share price appreciation does make it one of the hottest stocks of the past year or so, there are countless other examples of equities making similar jumps but in small time periods."", 'Two recent examples of such hot stocks are Ocean Biomedical, Inc.

Unsurprisingly perhaps, both belong to the biotechnology sector, which is another area of the stock market that is highly sensitive to interest rates. The former is a biotechnology firm founded by professors from the illustrious Brown University, and the stock is up by 163% since Ocean Biomedical, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCEA) announced that its joint venture firm had made progress related to a Hepatitis B treatment. This treatment is particularly special, as according to the firm, it is the first human data from a genetically modified T-Cell vaccine.', ""The second hot stock, Elevation Oncology, Inc.

146,73f0a92b-bc0b-3c05-9aff-16ecf6cb13af,NVDA,2024-03-30,These Tech Titans Are Teaming Up Against Nvidia,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/73f0a92b-bc0b-3c05-9aff-16ecf6cb13af/these-tech-titans-are-teaming.html,1711803600,STORY,"['NVDA', 'INTC', 'QCOM', 'AMD', 'MSFT']","[""Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares soared nearly 2,000% over the past five years and turned the chipmaker into the world's third-most-valuable company. That growth was largely driven by its brisk sales of data center GPUs for processing AI tasks."", ""The market's appetite for those high-end GPUs could continue to outstrip Nvidia's available supply for the foreseeable future. Its revenue soared 126% in fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), and analysts expect it to maintain a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 as the artificial intelligence (AI) market expands."", ""The bulls believe Nvidia still has plenty of room to run, even as AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) ramps up its production of its own AI GPUs and major customers like OpenAI and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) start developing their own in-house chips. However, a new threat might be emerging: Some of the world's largest tech companies have formed a new open-source alliance to prevent Nvidia from dominating the AI market with its closed-source programming platform."", ""To develop apps optimized for Nvidia's GPUs, software developers need to access the chipmaker's closed-source CUDA (Computer Unified Device Architecture) programming platform. Those developers would need to access other programming platforms -- like Intel's OneAPI and AMD's MIOpen -- to port their applications to other brands of GPUs."", ""Since Nvidia already dominates the data center GPU market, there's not much of an incentive for developers to rewrite their applications for other GPU brands. Many of Nvidia's critics believe the symbiotic relationship between its GPUs and CUDA platform supports its near-monopolization the GPU market and locks in its software developers."", ""That's why it wasn't too surprising when Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Qualcomm, Samsung, Arm, Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Cloud, Broadcom's Vmware, Fujitsu, and Imagination Technologies recently teamed up to create the UXL (Unified Acceleration) Foundation."", 'The UXL Foundation plans to use Intel\'s OneAPI as a foundation to create an open-source alternative to Nvidia\'s CUDA platform. It doesn\'t plan to release its first ""mature"" platform until the second half of this year, but its arrival could potentially loosen Nvidia\'s iron grip on the GPU software and hardware markets.', ""These tech titans clearly want to challenge Nvidia's dominance of the AI market, but the UXL Foundation probably won't make much near-term progress for three simple reasons."", ""First, Nvidia still develops the world's most powerful data center GPUs. Even though its customers are dealing with supply constraints for its newest GPUs, they won't abruptly switch over to Intel or AMD's discrete GPUs just to save a few dollars."", ""That's why the vast majority of Google Cloud's GPUs are still Nvidia chips, even though it's been gradually developing and testing its own first-party chips in recent years. Therefore, a battle between the CUDA and UXL platforms won't even matter unless one of the GPU underdogs takes a meaningful bite out of Nvidia's dominant market share."", ""Second, AMD -- Nvidia's closest competitor in the discrete GPU race -- hasn't joined the UXL Foundation yet. Another missing tech giant is OpenAI's top backer, Microsoft, which recently started buying AMD's AI GPUs. Therefore, AMD and Microsoft might be quietly working on more ways to promote AMD's MIOpen as an open-source alternative to CUDA and UXL. That fragmentation could, ironically, weaken the open-source push against CUDA and indirectly help Nvidia."", ""Lastly, the UXL Foundation plans to expand its open-source programming platform to Nvidia's GPUs in the future. That roadmap might make it easier for developers to optimize their software for a wider range of GPUs, but it also seems to be a blatant admission that Nvidia will remain the 800-pound gorilla of the GPU market."", ""Nvidia's stock dipped after the UXL announcement, but I think it's a lot of sound and fury that signifies nothing. These big tech companies are teaming up to create an open-source alternative to CUDA, but that alliance is missing two major players and isn't co-developing any new chips that could actually challenge Nvidia. Simply put, this headline-grabbing team-up won't stir up any meaningful headwinds for Nvidia's near-term growth."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

In March, she wrote:', ""Without an explosion in software revenue to justify the overbuilding of GPU capacity, we would not be surprised to see a pause in spending, compounding a correction in excess inventories, particularly among the cloud customers that account for more than half of Nvidia's data center sales."", 'That does not necessarily mean Nvidia is a bad investment. The company has navigated supply gluts in the past, and the stock has always rebounded. But Ark Invest sees better opportunities elsewhere. So Wood and her team continued to sell shares of Nvidia throughout March, while redeploying capital in The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD), another company that stands to benefit from artificial intelligence.', ""Here's what investors should know about the ad tech company."", 'The Trade Desk operates the largest independent, demand-side platform, a type of ad tech software that helps media buyers plan, measure, and optimize data-driven campaigns across digital channels. Its platform features what management sees as industry-leading artificial intelligence (AI) and measurement capabilities, both of which help media buyers realize greater returns on ad spending.', 'The Trade Desk has a particularly strong presence in connected TV (CTV) and retail media, two of the fastest-growing advertising channels. In fact, Forrester Research recently said The Trade Desk dominates the CTV advertising space, and Morgan Stanley believes the company will ""ultimately be a leader in offsite retail-media advertising"" due to its independent business model and growing list of retail partners.', ""To elaborate, the term independent means The Trade Desk is not affiliated with any websites or mobile apps, so it has no reason to steer advertisers toward specific inventory. By comparison, Alphabet's Google has constructed an advertising ecosystem rife with conflicts of interest. It sells ad tech software to third-party media buyers and publishers, while simultaneously selling its own inventory from properties like Google Search and YouTube."", 'That means Google has a clear incentive to direct ad buyers toward specific inventory, and the company also competes against its own customers. The upshot of those conflicts is that brands are more willing to share data with an independent player like The Trade Desk. The company has used that advantage to embed its platform with robust AI and measurement capabilities.', 'Specifically, The Trade Desk sources data from numerous leading retailers to create measurement opportunities not available on other platforms. Its lineup of partners includes Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Target, Walgreens, and Albertsons, all of which rank among the ten largest retailers in the world. The unique data sourced from those retailers also lays the foundation for superior AI, simply because data is a limiting factor in training machine learning models.', 'The Trade Desk reported strong results in the fourth quarter. Customer retention remained over 95% for the tenth consecutive year, revenue rose 23% to $606 million, and net income according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) increased 36% to $0.19 per diluted share. CEO Jeff Green told analysts, ""We outperformed the rest of the digital advertising space for the last eight quarters."" He also said the company was uniquely positioned to continue gaining share not just in 2024, but also well into the future.', 'The Trade Desk launched a new platform called Kokai last June. It features a more advanced AI engine that synthesizes signals across 13 million impressions per second to help advertisers buy the right impression to reach the right audience at the right time. Kokai also incorporates new measurement capabilities that let advertisers assess retail-campaign performance and CTV ad quality.', 'Ultimately, Kokai should reduce friction and improve campaign outcomes for advertisers. That value proposition should bring more media buyers to The Trade Desk and help the company capture a greater portion of advertising budgets.', 'Digital ad spending is forecasted to increase at 15.5% annually through 2030, but The Trade Desk should grow more quickly given its strong presence in the quickly expanding CTV and retail-media channels. The company also believes it can accelerate growth in international markets. That is noteworthy because North America currently accounts for 88% of ad spending on the platform.', 'With that in mind, Wall Street analysts expect The Trade Desk to grow sales at 20% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 22.4 times sales seem tolerable, though certainly not cheap. Investors should expect volatility in the near term, but The Trade Desk could create significant shareholder value in the long run. Now is a good time to buy a small position in this growth stock.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company is the global leader in AI chips, and that's translated into a surge in earnings in recent times. Investors in this tech giant have been winning too, as the stock has soared more than 200% over the past year."", 'Nvidia is one of the stocks referred to as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" a group of technology players that are leaders in their industries -- and each one also happens to be investing in AI. So Nvidia isn\'t the only company set to score an AI victory and share that victory with investors.', ""In fact, another member of the Magnificent Seven is particularly interesting because it offers you exposure to AI as well as access to another high-growth business. So, forget Nvidia, and let's check out this top stock to buy now."", ""You probably know this company well, as it may deliver groceries, essentials, and general merchandise to your door -- or offer you access to entertainment like movies and books. I'm talking about Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The company is an e-commerce giant, which is important considering the growth forecast for this market. Global retail e-commerce sales may surpass $8 trillion by 2027, representing a 38% increase from today's level, according to Statista."", 'Amazon is well positioned to benefit thanks to its dominance, but the company also has made moves in recent times that should ensure this leadership. After struggling with higher inflation back in 2022, Amazon improved its cost structure, cutting jobs, favoring efficiency, and making key changes across its fulfillment network. All of these efforts helped it recover from a difficult time, but they also should help Amazon thrive during better times, too.', 'For example, the company shifted its U.S. fulfillment model from a national one to a regional one -- meaning inventory of popular products is kept in areas throughout the country. This has shortened delivery times, helping Amazon lower its cost to serve. And this move also means Amazon is able to be more competitive -- offering a broader selection of items at lower average selling prices while still maintaining its profitability.', ""Though Amazon's cloud computing business -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- drives profit at Amazon, the North American business, which includes e-commerce operations, still represented about 40% of total operating income last year. So, Amazon's ability to grow and stay ahead in e-commerce is a crucial element for long-term success, and it looks like Amazon is on the right path."", ""Now, let's consider the company's AI story, which intersects with both its e-commerce and cloud computing businesses. Amazon has been using AI to improve its own operations, so this technology could play a role in lifting profitability this way over time."", ""For example, through AI, Amazon determines the best delivery routes, another element that's helped it save money and time on deliveries. Another example: Amazon uses AI to help customers rapidly find just the right products -- this, along with low prices and fast delivery speeds, could keep them coming back."", ""As for AWS, this business is going all-in on AI, offering everything from a wide selection of chips to a fully managed AI service that lets customers tailor top large language models for their own use. Here, Amazon is set to benefit from AI as it helps its customers deploy AI projects -- and since AWS is the world's biggest cloud company, it has direct access to an enormous number of potential customers."", ""All of this means Amazon is set to benefit from AI in two ways. The technology should help it save time and money in its own business operations, therefore boosting profitability over time. And Amazon's position as a provider of AI products and services through AWS also should add to profit."", ""So investors buying Amazon shares today gain access to all of this AI growth -- and the icing on the cake is the growth potential of the company's e-commerce business. It's not surprising that Amazon, valued at 42x forward earnings estimates, trades at a slight premium to Nvidia (Nvidia trades at 36x forward earnings)."", ""Amazon's strength across e-commerce and cloud computing as well as its investment in AI makes it a business that's well diversified -- meaning it's high growth, yet doesn't come with as much risk as a company that's more dependent on selling AI products or services."", ""Don't get me wrong -- Nvidia still is an attractive stock for many reasons. But Amazon offers investors a very complete package, including AI and more, and that makes it a top Magnificent Seven buy right now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

According to the Hurun report for the Global Rich List 2024, the United States added the most billionaires, introducing 109 new billionaires to the list. India was the second best country, adding 84 new people to the list of billionaires. Though foreseeable, China caught most off guard and lost 155 billionaires due to the economic distress and property market crisis.\xa0', ""China’s economy is going through a systemic slowdown. As we mentioned in our article about 36 countries with deflation or dangerously low inflation, China is suffering from low inflation and it could lead to deflation. China had a successive series of declines in its consumer price index (CPI) during 2023, which started falling in January 2023 and continued till July 2023. The CPI plunged from 104 points in January 2023 to 102.7 points in July 2023. China’s bigger issue is its property market crisis. China's real estate development dropped by 9.6% and home sales fell by 6.5% in 2023. More than 50 real estate companies have defaulted on debt due to the property market crash in China. Real estate giant, The China Evergrande Group (OTC:EGRNQ) is one of the many companies facing default. On March 22, Reuters reported that Chinese authorities are looking into PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) for its potential role in The China Evergrande Group’s (OTC:EGRNQ) $78 billion fraud.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) was a main cause for the rise of billionaires as half of new billionaires were driven by AI.

If you want to skip our overview of the industrial sector, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Best Industrial Machinery Stocks to Invest in. ', 'The industrial machinery industry is one of the most capital intensive in the world. Setting up a firm that makes these machines is not an easy task, and it often requires years of expertise and hefty amounts of capital which until very recently were only available to sizeable nation states such as the United States and the Soviet Union.', 'Over the course of time, these companies, which often trace their roots back to the industrial boom in the U.S. during the second world war, have become private entities. At the same time, the high barriers of entry mean that not only are the top industrial machinery stocks among some of the most advanced companies in the world but also that these firms enjoy the comfort of economies of scale that are hard to compete with.', 'As an example, consider some of the most valuable industrial machinery stocks in terms of market capitalization. A couple of such firms are General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW), and Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN). General Electric, makes and sells some of the most advanced machines in the world. These include jet engines which are the backbone of the U.S. Air Force and nuclear reactors. These reactors are some of the most exacting engineered products on the planet due to the high stress environment in which they operate and the extreme catastrophe that awaits them should even the slightest thing go awry.', 'Similarly, Eaton plays an integral role in the global aviation supply chain. An average jet engine for a commercial airliner can contain as many as fifty thousand individual components, from high precision crystal fan blades to pipes, pumps, and hydraulic motors. All of these have to be kept in prime condition, and they are built to a standard that not many firms can achieve.', 'However, unlike high growth technology stocks, industrial machinery stocks are more down to Earth. Like their technology peers, their performance depends on interest rates since funding pricey manufacturing plants and other equipment requires loans. Similarly, the rosier the economic outlook is, the better industrial machinery stocks fare on the stock market since the demand for their products is assumed to be stable.', 'As an illustration of this aspect of industrial machinery stock performance, consider the shares of General Electric and Eaton. They bled as much as 51% of their share price value on the stock market after the coronavirus lockdowns were put into place, as investor outlook for the global economy darkened.', 'But what about recent stock performance? After all, investor expectations of an easing in interest rates could also generate tailwinds for industrial machinery stocks. 2024 has seen investors start off the year on an optimistic note for rate cuts, but settle with the knowledge that the Fed might take longer than they would like. Year to date, both GE and Eaton are up by 39% and 31%, respectively, with GE enjoying slightly higher returns in the wake of its announcement that it will split into two companies.', ""Analyzing industrial machinery stocks means that investors have to focus on their product portfolio and the potential to both reduce costs (often dubbed as 'improving margins') and gain market share. Both these themes were also present during the latest full hedge fund investor letter cycle which was for the fourth quarter of 2023."", 'For instance, Southeastern Asset Management mentioned General Electric in its investor letter for the period as it outlined:', 'General Electric - Industrial conglomerate General Electric (GE) was the top performer for the year. We exited this multi-year investment as its price went above our appraisal. In 1Q23, GE spun out GE Healthcare, which we sold as it traded at our value. The share price continued its strong performance throughout the spring and summer, and we ultimately sold the position in the third quarter when we no longer saw a margin of safety for the business. CEO Larry Culp was a great partner who created significant value for shareholders by reducing leverage, cutting costs, streamlining operations, improving company culture and simplifying the structure with plans to split the company into three businesses. We hope to have the opportunity to partner with him again in the future.', 'Artisan Partners was more detailed in its coverage of Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) when it shared:', 'Xylem is a global leader in water technology across pumps, smart meters and treatment services. More than 80% of the company’s sales come from markets where it maintains the No. 1 or No. 2 market position. Xylem’s pumps business (selling primarily to utilities) is a sticky and profitable operation that provides capital to invest in more innovative solutions, such as smart meters. In mid-2023, Xylem completed the acquisition of Evoqua, giving it a leading position in the US water treatment business. We believe the company is at the start of a compelling profit cycle. Smart meter sales are recovering from supply chain issues, cost and revenue synergies from the acquisition are in the early innings, and a newly hired (and well- respected) CFO should help catalyze long-awaited margin expansion. Meanwhile, rising demand for solutions to water sustainability challenges should persist as a strong trend for years to come.', 'Seems like smart money is, like always, aware of broader trends that could be helping industrial machinery stocks set themselves up for years of growth. Consequently, we decided to take a look at some such stocks and the notable names were Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH).', 'A factory floor filled with specialized drug manufacturing machinery and workers.', 'Our Methodology', 'To make our list of the best industrial machinery stocks, we ranked the most valuable specialty industrial machinery and heavy machinery stocks by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023 and picked out the top stocks.', 'For these best industrial machinery stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

Gentlemen, great to have you both here."", 'Matt Argersinger: Hey, Dylan.', 'Andy Cross: Hey, Dylan.', ""Dylan Lewis: We've got a run-down on retail, the state of things at Paramount and of course, stocks on our radar. But we're kicking off with real estate news, Matt, after several years and lawsuits related to excessive fees and antitrust activity, we might be looking at a new real estate market."", ""Matt Argersinger: We might be, Dylan, if you ever sold a home. It's always been confounding well, at least for me, that in addition to paying a commission to your agent, in that case, the seller's agent or the listing agent, you'd also have to pay a 2.5, 3% commission to the buyer's agent. And this was essentially, for decades, a mandate of the National Association of Realtors, NAR, of which the vast majority of agents in the US are members of. It's why commissions on transacting home haven't traditionally been set in this 5-6% range, split evenly, usually by the seller's agent and the buyer's agent."", ""So instantaneously on every transaction, in addition to other closing costs, repair expenses, 5-6% of your homes' equity would instantly, that had been built up maybe for over many years, and worth tens of thousands of dollars would instantly go away for these commissions. It always seemed like one of the final areas of the market that had yet to be disrupted. Because if you think about what's happened to travel agents, what's happened to brokerage commissions, certainly transacting and almost everything in the country has gotten cheaper overtime except transacting a house."", ""If you look at the median price of a home in the US, right around $400,000, that's 20,000 or more in commissions just to sell a house. But here we are. The NAR has essentially settled, which means they are not contesting any more of these lawsuits, the civil action suits against them, they're paying a fee and the idea is that they're going to lose their monopoly position on the marketplace. Now, agents won't be required to be members of the NAR."", ""They won't be forced, for example, to subscribe to MLS listings already get paid and essentially makes real estate agents, free agents that can set their own commissions. And if you're a home seller, or a homebuyer, gives you far more negotiating power. You can pay a commission to a buyer that you want to pay, and it's no longer causing a mandate to pay a commission to the other side of the transaction."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, and looking at this news, I was trying to process both the news itself and then the follow-on impact that it would have. And I feel like for buyers and sellers, we're probably looking at lower fees and a little bit more flexibility. Beyond that in the business landscape of real estate, I feel like it's really hard to nail down what it means for companies like Zillow, Redfin, and other operators."", ""Matt Argersinger: I think clearly for the publicly traded agencies, this is not going to be great news. I mean, those fees are coming down, their margins have to come down. The business is going to change. There's going to be less agents in the marketplace. For companies like Redfin and Zillow, it is a little cloudy for me, because for one, Redfin who has already trying to disrupt the whole transaction fee of this marketplace anyway and with Zillow, Zillow really depends on the vast majority of its revenue still comes from agents who pays a low for leads on their marketplace."", ""They need agents, and they depend on the traditional model. So for Zillow, it's also could be disruptive, although a little confusing. I would just say this, good real estate agents do deserve to get paid. I don't want to make it seem like these commissions were being paid out the door for nothing. I mean, many work really hard. I've worked with agents that had been great. They spent a lot of time working with buyers or sellers, and they deal with a lot of paperwork. There's a lot of value to what they do. So I feel like it's still, in a way, it makes the marketplace better for them because I think good agents will thrive. Good agents will still get paid. A lot of agents who were just living off these richly undeserved agent commissions will not thrive."", ""Dylan Lewis: This week we've also got updates in AI sending tech companies in two different directions. We're going to kick off looking at Adobe here, Andy. Company reported earlier this week, results were good, but it seems like the guidance and the general outlook on how AI might be affecting the business has the market concerned."", ""Andy Cross: Yeah. Dylan, it's like that Damocles hanging over Adobe. AI is just waiting for that string to catch, to end up doing some serious damage to this company. This is a company that's been in investing in AI for a long time. Their Firefly solution, since its launch, now has more than 6.5 billion images created. They're investing in this space, and they talk a lot about this. However, even though that quarter was really quite good, revenues up 11%, adjusted earnings per share up 18%. They didn't have to pay a billion-dollar fee for the Figma transaction getting canceled. Their digital media revenue was up 12%."", ""Their ending annual recurring revenue, which is very important when you think about this business, up 14%. The Document Cloud business, which is part of their solutions and part of this package, was up 23%. So that's really impressive. Their digital experience revenue, that's their new marketing business they've been growing. That was up 10% with remaining performance obligations up 16%. So the quarter was all really positive, very good. However, it was all in the conversation about the guide in their future revenues, thinking about the bookings and how artificial intelligence is or is not impacting their business."", ""Especially it's things like OpenAI Sora, which is their text to video creating device and how much that's impacting, not just creating videos and imaging, but also giving clients the ability to edit those. Lots of conversations around what that means for their business. They didn't come out very enthusiastic about the guide going forward. Lots of conversations around with the analysts about what this means after minutia at the timings at this quarter, next quarter, a lot of concerns that so much of the growth of the year is going to be back-ended into the second half."", ""Clearly you see the stock reacting, more down 13% as we're going into tape this. The market clearly having some discussions and some hesitations about Adobe, which is the leader in this space. By the way, the stock has done very well over the last year. So I think the most pullback maybe a little ahead of itself and this is some of the pullback we're seeing."", ""Dylan Lewis: A different story with AI over at Oracle. This is a company that is catching the tailwinds of AI. Matt shares up 10% this week following the company's fiscal Q3 report. Thanks in large part to demand for the company's Cloud offerings."", ""Matt Argersinger: Absolutely. I mean, if you look at the headlines, revenue up 7%, adjusted EPS up 16%, both better-than-expected, but the two likely reasons, and you hit one of them, the stock has been up so much. First Oracle's remaining performance obligation, RPO, Andy mentioned this for Adobe as well. This is basically sales that Oracle is contractually obligated to fulfill, but hasn't yet quite recognize as revenue or if you're a simple investor like me, it's called backlog."", ""That's up to 80 billion, up 29% year over year. So that's just revenue growth is going to continue to be fairly robust going forward for Oracle. But the Cloud revenue for Oracle, 25% year over year, Cloud infrastructure business, 49% increase year over year. That's the piece that really competes with the bigger at Cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft's Azure."", ""You can conclude right there that Oracle is gaining market share. The big reason for that is a CEOs Safra Catz, demand for Oracle's Artificial Intelligence Cloud capabilities far exceeding supply. To address this, Oracle actually signed a new agreement with Nvidia in the quarter, investing heavily in opening and expanding its data center network. The AI plug in here for Oracle is very real and very robust, and it's got investors really excited about the business, obviously."", 'Dylan Lewis: Matt, right there, you name checked a lot of the big companies and brands that we associate with cloud discussion, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon. We have generally left Oracle out of the conversation for the big Cloud players, do you feel like we need to start bringing them into that group?', ""Matt Argersinger: I think so. This might eventually become a big four with Oracle. Because if you think on Oracle, all the other three companies that you mentioned all have big leads, big market shares, but they're also doing very different things in a lot of different markets. Amazon in particular, Alphabet of course, with advertising and YouTube. This is Oracle's business. I mean, database networking Cloud infrastructure is their business. It's their focus. I think they're going to continue to gain market share."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break over at Under Armour, it's meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis joined in studio with Matt Argersinger and Andy Cross. We've got a rundown on retail and apparel. We're going to start things off with Williams-Sonoma, a huge week for them, Andy, shares up 18% following the company's earnings release. Even though net income declined year over year and revenue was basically flat. Andy, what's going on here?"", ""Andy Cross: Well, on the earnings per share, because they buy back so much stock, it was actually up a little bit just 3%, but far ahead of analysts' estimates and the sales were down 7%. Again ahead of estimates was much better than how management had guided. Laura Alber has been leading Williams-Sonoma for so many years, so successfully years. I think very conservative when she thinks about running this company, she and her team. Been talking about the challenging market."", ""We're having comp sales down. Almost 7%, that was better than two years ago but worse than a year ago. The four-year company, you go back four years, Williams-Sonoma Lakes have focused on that pre-pandemic. They were up almost 30%. I mentioned the earnings per share, gross margins is where they won Dylan in this quarter. Higher merchandise margins, lower supply costs. Williams-Sonoma has been really effective at managing their supply costs."", ""Being very efficient as how they have taken out more and more costs from their supply chain, how the pricing is starting to impact that. They've been talking about that for the past year, which is one reason why their stock has done so well. That allows them to get more efficient when it comes at gross margin up at 46% versus 41% a year ago. The inventories were down 14%. Again, they're just managing this business, blocking and tackling very well."", ""Operating cash flow was up 60% for the year. But because they've been so efficient on their capital expenditure, free cash flow more than doubled, that allowed them to announce a 26% increase in the dividend certainly helps with the stock price performing so well. Even though comps really for the year where basically down across the board and for the quarter."", ""Dylan Lewis: Andy, this is probably not accompanying that a lot of people necessarily have on their radar and it is to their detriment. Shares up 140% over the last 12 months. It's been an incredible performer. The stock is currently at all-time highs for people that maybe haven't been following this business. Do you feel like the valuation is in a good spot or do you think it's getting a little rich?"", ""Andy Cross: Here's just some context behind that. I'm a fan of Williams-Sonoma and a shareholder and we've recommended the stock in lots of different spots here at The Motley Fool. The market cap is more than 18 billion. It sells at around an earnings multiple of around 20 times. Historically their earnings multiple is more in the low double-digits or call it the 12, 13, 15 times range. When it got so cheap, it got down to single digits, which is one reason why the stock has done so well. If you want to nibble, fine, don't go all rushing, but put it on your watchlist. Certainly, if you don't have it as one to keep an eye on."", 'Dylan Lewis: We have a less glamorous story going on over at Under Armour. News out this week that founder Kevin Plank will be stepping back into the CEO role and Matt, the market did not seem too excited about it.', ""Matt Argersinger: Not at all, Dylan. The stock sold off pretty hard. I think there's a few reasons for this, which we'll get into. One, it's interesting, the current or now former CEO, Stephanie Linnartz, she's only on the job for about a year and she was in the first year of what she thought was going to be a three-year turnaround for the business. Clearly, that turnaround is not happening to the satisfaction of the board and probably to a lot of investors."", ""But I just found that press release from Under Armour very short, very vague. I felt like this needed a letter from Kevin Plank saying why he's coming back, why he thinks it's important for him to step back into the CEO role. We didn't get that. We just got a pretty short press release. That's interesting. If you look at Under Armour stock, it's been stuck in the low single-digits for what seems like forever. Maybe there's a little bit of desperation here, but you have to remember how Plank left the CEO spot in 2019. Putting aside his various personal scandals, he didn't leave the company in exactly a great state."", ""Revenue growth had already flatlined for a few years, he made several poor acquisitions to try to digitize the brand. Inventory hadn't been managed well. They failed to gain traction at leisure market which I feel they basically invented it. Yet they see that to Lululemon and Nike and others. This isn't Steve Jobs coming back to the doors. This is not Howard Schultz coming in or Michael Dell coming back. A founder that's going to come back and lead the company to glory. I think that's why the market is taking a very cautious look here and saying this is a CEO with a pretty tumultuous tenure at the end. Coming back can a turnaround really happen now?"", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, I have not sold very many stocks that I've owned and when I have almost without exception, it has been the wrong decision. The exception to that is Under Armour. [laughs] I sold my shares, I think when it was in the mid-teens and this business has not managed to get back on track. It's down about 50% from then. Recently, shares are at their lowest level in almost a decade. What is the return to normal even look like for this business?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I don't know, Dylan. Unfortunately, I'm still a shareholder, and Under Armour withheld throughout. You see the stocks at a 10-year low. I looked at it. It's about a 17-year low in the stock price. But this is a situation where I step back and say, wait a second, how much worse can this actually get? Because if you look at Under Armour's stock, it's trading for about 0.6 times revenue. For comparison, Nike trades at three times revenue."", ""The stock's at a 17-year low. This is the kind that still generates healthy cash from operations. We were talking about before the show, that the brand has to have some equity value. That's probably greater or somewhere in the vicinity of three billion, which is its market cap. Maybe it can't get worse and just maybe Kevin Plank finds a little bit of that entrepreneurial magic he had early on in Under Armour. Three years from now, four years from now we're looking at Under Armour and it's $25 stock."", 'Andy Cross: Six dangerous words in an estimate. How much lower can this go? Just be mindful of that.', ""Dylan Lewis: You're pumping the brakes there a little bit there Andy."", 'Andy Cross: Be cautious there.', ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to wrap the company updates with a look at Ulta Andy, shares the cosmetic company down 5% after earnings. What's the story here?"", ""Andy Cross: It's interesting, the quarter was actually pretty good. It wasn't anything to really crow about. Revenues were up almost 10%. Earnings at $8.08 ahead of estimates so that was actually quite strong. Their comp sales were at 2.5% but that was versus 16% a year ago so a pretty good deceleration and a little bit lower than the estimates, which I think is what has the stock lower."", ""Transactions up 4.5% but pricing or average cost of the goods that someone buys down almost 2%. The gross margin was up a little bit. Lower shipping, better supply chain costs. Same thing was we sold Williams-Sonoma. I don't think quite as effective at Ulta, but a little bit better, but lower on the merchandise margin, which was different than what we saw at Williams-Sonoma. Sales gross and operating margin the cost down at 23.1% versus 23.6%."", ""They're doing a pretty good job of managing the cost that boosted the operating margin to 14.5% versus 13.9%. A lot of numbers there, but ultimately, they've done a pretty good job managing the cost in a relatively slower-growth business. Skincare up very much. One interesting little tidbit there. They talked about the sales for the makeup category decreased in low-single-digit range. They saw softness in prestige cosmetics was partially offset by growth in mass makeup. They pointed at Elf Beauty as one of the ones that are doing pretty well at Ulta."", ""Dylan Lewis: It's interesting. I haven't taken a look at the quarter, but I'm wondering if they said anything about shrink or anything like that, Andy. I don't know if you guys caught it, I only caught a little bit of it, but CNBC did this pretty large report this past week about retail theft. I can't remember the exact story, but I guess there was a ring of resellers who had stolen millions of dollars and Ulta is one of the big victims here of just ceiling this high-margin makeup, reselling it, pocketing the difference and I know they made some arrest. But it was a remarkable story."", ""Matt Argersinger: It was a huge enterprise, actually a criminal enterprise. Now I think this quarter didn't get nearly the tension as we've seen in the past. I think you'll see that they're starting to peak a little bit in there talking about shrink I think but it still continues to be an issue. The guidance, by the way, just very quickly is that comp sales at 4-5% versus 5.7%. That's for the full year guided ahead. Comp sales for this year ahead, not quite as good as last year."", ""Dylan Lewis: I'm glad you brought up the shrink story there, Matt because I remember looking at Target's results earlier this earnings season and I think it was two quarters ago, shrink was the narrative. They made that statement, I think it was a $500 million adjustment. Some of the numbers that they were looking out for the year saying that shrink was the culprit."", ""We didn't see a lot of headlines on that. We didn't see a lot of discussion of that with the most recent earnings release but we've actually dig into management's calls. It came up 12 times. It is still a story for some of these retailers and we're still hearing management talk about it but it seems like one of those things that has crested as a wave already when it comes to financials."", ""Matt Argersinger: When CNBC does a special report or in a special documentary and something that usually as Andy alluded to, it's looked at the peak but it might be one of those situations where hopefully companies are figuring it out and moving on."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt Argersinger, Andy Cross, fellows, we're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next, we dig into the turmoil at Paramount and the possible path forward for the entertainment giant. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Award season is over, but there's still plenty of drama unfolding in Hollywood. Motley Fool Money is Ricky Mulvey caught up with Bloomberg entertainment reporter Lucas Shaw for a look at the business of streaming, the power of incentives and corporate infighting at Paramount."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It's a tough time to be a movie company, but do you think there's starting to be a greater willingness to go for those singles and doubles now that there's some adult dramas that are doing poorly. Ferrari did not make money. But Anyone but You, which was a romantic comedy made more than 200 million at the box office. Like A24 eked out a profit with Iron Claw. So is that door continuing to open a little bit for those adult dramas that used to just go to streaming."", ""Lucas Shaw: I get very mixed signals on this and I think it's hard to answer that holistically. I don't think that these companies are giving up the Tentpole strategy, which is, let's have a handful of really expensive, really big movies. Because when those hit, they make so much money that it pays for everything else. They can't really move away from that for that reason. But you do see certain studios. I think Universal, Sony, and Warner Brothers, foremost among them making a wide range of movies, believing that there is value in having to use your metaphor, a single or a double, in addition to the home run."", ""If you look at the types of programming that Netflix is going to do, I think they are going to take fewer really big swings and make more movies. That cost in the 20-$100 million range, which is, I don't know that it's going to be a bunch of dramas. I think it's going to be comedy, and thriller, and action, and things like that. But I do think you'll see a good number of movies made that are in that middle that the big studios had really forsaken over the last several years."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, and I want to own a move to Paramount, which you covered in a story called How Paramount Became A Cautionary Tale Of The Streaming Wars. The only thing on their upcoming slate seems to be those big Tentpole films after the Bob Marley movie, and they did Mean Girls. But then upcoming it seems that it's a Transformers movie, they're going to do a PAW patrol movie and it's not these small movies. They might have trouble attracting creators right now to get those smaller to midsize movies for their studio."", ""Lucas Shaw: The problems at Paramount have made it very hard for that studio to do deals. I've spoken with executives there who've been very pleasantly surprised, I should say, at some of the talent who've reupped their relationships with the studio, including John Krasinski though, filmmaker of A Quiet Place. But you talked to a lot of producers and they're pretty clear that Paramount would be their last choice, both because it's a company that just hasn't made that many movies."", ""Other than basically Top Gun, hasn't delivered a lot of huge hits. But I think more than anything because of the uncertainty at the corporate level where you have a controlling shareholder in Shari Redstone who pretty clearly would like to sell the business, is looking for buyers, is struggling to find buyers. She's looking to exit, not because this is a great time to sell and you can get a great deal, but because the business has been declining and she wants to get out while she still can."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Can you take us into the informal auction going on for for Paramount right now. Where's that sit?"", ""Lucas Shaw: Actually, you know what? Let's let's take it back a step. I think Shari decided that she wanted to sell at some point last year. Some people say over the summer, some people say in the fall. Either way, she had been approached over the years by a few parties. She really started late last year talking to David Ellison, who runs a company called Skydance, whose father is Larry Ellison, one of the richest men in the world. David Ellison's company is a co-financier and producer of Top Gun, of the Mission Impossible movies, of Star Trek movies, all Paramount biggest franchises."", ""David Ellison would like to buy Shari Redstone out of National Amusements, which is the family holding company, a movie theater chain that has the stake in Paramount and then merge his company with Paramount. The challenge with this is that while that deal is great for Shari Redstone, it's not necessarily great for Paramount. I think there's some people who are skeptical about why you would want to merge with Skydance other than because David Ellison wants them to and there would certainly be a dispute over valuation."", ""So you've got Shari Redstone and her camp looking to see if there are other bidders. Because anytime you're trying to sell, you want to have multiple bidders so you can drive up the price. So she's talked to David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Brothers discovery. She's talked to Apollo, the private equity firm, and she's talked to some other potential buyers. At the same time, you've got the company of Paramount with advisors looking to see if there are other offers because they don't necessarily love this David Ellison idea."", ""That's the state of play. We know that David Ellison is interested and has at least made a preliminary offer. We know there have been conversations with a couple of other parties, but it's not clear that there is another tangible offer or real buyer on the table right now for the company. So it's an open question as to whether they're going to get a deal done."", 'Ricky Mulvey: In the past, Netflix was a part of the conversation. Warner Brothers discovery looked at it briefly.', ""Lucas Shaw: It should be noted. I should just on that point, that yes, Netflix has been part of the conversation, but Netflix was part of the conversation in so much as it wanted to buy just the studio, Paramount Pictures. I think there are a lot of entities that would be happy to buy just the studio because it's got a good library that they could exploit and film and television, it's got, honestly great real estate that lot in Hollywood alone is worth billions of dollars."", ""The problem is that if you're Shari Redstone and you don't want to sell just the studio because it's your most valuable asset. So then you're left with a bunch of stuff nobody wants. If you're a buyer, it's the stuff nobody wants. Like you don't necessarily want to take these declining cable networks. So it's going to be interesting to see Shari Redstone's probably going to have to sell at a discount to unload the stuff that nobody wants in order to unload the whole company."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It seems that there has been a little bit of pride when they've had offers on the table. BET was one of them where the deal is off by a billion dollars, so everybody walks away. Now Paramount may get to a point where there's no option other than the buyer that's willing to take on the company."", ""Lucas Shaw: Yeah. I mean, it's crazy that they almost sold. They could have sold BET, they could've sold Showtime. That would have raised enough money between the two of them. If they did the deals, they probably could've gotten 4.5-5 billion dollars, that would solved a lot of problems. They could have paid off a lot of debt. They could have funded a bunch of stuff for the streaming service and yeah, they just didn't want to do it."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Is the cardinal misstep that Paramount made with streaming, which is their main loser of money. Just that they were late to the party or were there other mistakes along the way?', ""Lucas Shaw: They were definitely late. But that was not the cardinal sin because every company was late and every company that went in is facing the same conundrum right now, whether it's Paramount, or Warner Brothers Discovery, or Disney, or in a lesser way, Comcast because there are more diversified enterprise. But entities that have a bunch of cable networks are just watching as they fall into the sea and their streaming service is not rising fast enough."", ""So should they have moved faster? Yes, Disney moved a little bit faster. Having a lot of the same problems. I think the issue is that this was always going to be painful and you have this incredibly lucrative business that was going away and entities that made a lot of money from that business were not going to rush to kill it. It's the the classic innovator's dilemma that people talk about. Netflix was able to come in as a new player and disrupt this business and none of the competition moved fast or move quickly enough to respond."", 'I do think that Paramount has made some specific missteps. I mean, you look at it and I should also say Paramount was hamstrung by the corporate infighting. There were two separate entities, CBS and Viacom, that the Redstones controlled. Shari Redstone had to spend many years fighting to cement family control over them in disputes with management of both companies, when she did actually put it together. That then took a while to make it happen. So there were a lot of hurdles to making it work. Then they spent a lot of money really quickly.', ""They didn't think about it. All these companies made the same mistake. They had to try to compress 15 years of Netflix's building into a short time frame and we can debate, is there any way in which that would have gone well? Or was it just a function of going late and I'm not sure the answer. I'm sure that there were sounder strategies with these companies. I also think that had they acted five-years earlier, there's no guarantee it would have worked."", ""Ricky Mulvey: On Paramount, Shari Redstone wants a buyer. What happens if Paramount doesn't find a buyer?"", ""Lucas Shaw: It's a good question. It's the one facing all of these enterprises. Then Shari faces a couple of options. She can stay the course and believe that we've suffered maximum pain right now and the streaming service is going to keep growing, or we're going to manage costs and we'll figure it out. I don't think Wall Street would be very happy to hear that because it isn't working right now. There's a strategy where they resort to selling individual pieces again or where they halt costs a bit more. Then there's a more dramatic one which some have proposed which I still don't see them doing."", ""But this notion of them becoming a pure arms dealer, which means that they shut down the streaming service and just be a studio and sell the others. But considering that that company makes basically all of its money from cable networks and to some extent from streaming. That's where most of the employees are. That would require, I should say, gutting the business. You'd fire 50-80% of the staff, which is why I see that is unlikely but she'll have to have to make some big changes if she cuts it because if they come out and say, they haven't officially said that they're for sale but if there was a bunch of coverage basically saying that the deal talks were over, their stocks is going to tank."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I think there's also an interesting angle on this with the power of incentives. I want to talk about David Zaslav in a sec, but in this case, there's an early misstep from the CEO, Philipe Dauman, this guy was making so much money in stock awards. He incentivized to boost the stock price and then in order to do so, he's buying back stock, which means they're not investing into content and growing the business for the long term."", ""Lucas Shaw: Philipe Dauman, really one of the worst media CEOs of the last 20-plus years, I would say. Maybe, ever. He took what was one of the most vibrant and great businesses, in Viacom, drove it into the ground. He didn't understand Netflix, he didn't understand YouTube and rather than invest a bunch of money in streaming, which he should've done because they had the networks that were most exposed. MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, they speak to young people so you could see the trends early. I"", 'nstead of investing in streaming, he just bought back a bunch of stock. He did whatever he could to prop up the share price and it was really destructive to the enterprise long term. All the mistakes that Shari Redstone and Bob Bakish may or may not have made Philipe made more. Sumner Redstone, who was in charge of the company at the time and was the was the owner, they deserve the largest share of the blame, no question.', ""Ricky Mulvey: I wonder if there's an incentive problem right now. If Warner Brothers discovery and you've talked about it on the town, where David Zaslav has compensation award tied to the free cash flow of the business. I was talking to one of our investment analysts, Tim Buyers earlier. Basically, that's an uncommon way to incentivize a CEO. Feel free to break down this theory but now you have HBO or the company that's essentially shelved movies, one of which recently was the Wiley Coyote vs Acme movie. You get a tax loss on that, which is going to boost. You get the immediate boost of free cash flow but then, you might be killing ideas, drawing away creators."", ""Lucas Shaw: It's a question of whether he's incentivized to just cut cost to make cash flow look good and get himself paid more rather than act in the best interest of the company. It's a tough press. I don't think that David Zaslav made free cash and the Board made free cash flow the most important metric for his pay just because they knew that they were going to cut costs. I think they wanted to set the target. We have all this debt and we need to save money to pay it off. How are we going to incentivize people to do that? We're going to incentivize them to generate free cash flow and that's what they did."", ""That being said, it's just a terrible look for this guy who's about to get paid a ton of money, even though their stock is in the toilet, nobody thinks the company is performing very well. By the way, that free cash flow being the metric for performance and how people are paid, that doesn't apply to most of the employees of that company. It mostly applies to David Zaslav and maybe the inner circle. They're really perverse incentives there."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Listeners, you can catch Lucas Shaw on X. He is @Lucas_Shaw. Coming up after the break, Andy Cross and Matt Argersinger return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Dylan Lewis: As always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis joined again by Matt Argersinger and Andy Cross. If you went all in on the Stanley tumbler craze, you're going to have to make room in your cupboard for another weird household item that has caught fire. Andy, grocer Trader Joe's began selling mini tote bags for $3 in March. They are now selling for hundreds of dollars online. What are you make of this new consumer craze?"", ""Andy Cross: How many is many on the per square inch of tote bags? This has got to be a record if they're really small. We just bought a Stanley for $35 at REI and those things are some serious piece of hardware. We're now part of the Stanley craze, I think we have two of them now at the house so I can understand that. If it's me, when I go to Trader Joe's, I buy a lot of stuff. I'm bringing tote bags, hanging them on my shoulder, pulling them out of my jackets. Minis are not helping me very much."", 'Dylan Lewis: I think you timed the market well on that. I think you got in on the tumblers slightly after the peak and maybe have a good cost basis there. Matt, what do you make of these consumer phrases?', ""Matt Argersinger: I can't speak to this. I'm a guy who takes brown bags run reused bags to the grocery store and reuses them so I have I can't believe people are paying $100 for tote bags. I cannot believe it."", ""Dylan Lewis: I'm just happy people are using reusable bags. That makes me happy."", 'Andy Cross: There you go.', ""Dylan Lewis: I'll take that. Let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question. Matt, you're up first this week, what are you looking at?"", ""Matt Argersinger: Weird special situation here, Equity Commonwealth, the ticker is EQC. Equity Commonwealth, it's a two billion dollar real estate investment trust with 2.2 billion in net cash. Do the math there. Yes, it's trading below the cash on its balance sheet. Now it does own four office buildings that are cash-flowing but materially they're a very small part of the story here. Management is essentially sitting on 2.2 billion in cash collecting 5% with treasuries, which is good but waiting to make a transformative investment for the business."", ""The problem is they've been sitting on their hands for quite a while now. Investors are starting to get a little impatient and now there's a hedge fund called Land and Buildings Investment Management, LLC. That's a mouthful them but they own 3% of EQC shares, and they've submitted a letter demanding that EQC actually liquidate the business because under their model, liquidating the business would actually result in a net asset value of about 20% above where EQC is trading in the public markets. We'll have to see if this gets any traction. But I think it's a fastening situation to watch over the next few months."", ""Dylan Lewis: Dan, a special situation with Equity Commonwealth. What's your question?"", ""Dan Boyd: A special situation is called for, it doesn't make any dang sense. I'm sorry, are you trying to sell us on cash or office buildings, Mattie?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I think cash but it sounds like I'm actually trying to sell Dan a tote bag from Trader Joe's Andy, you're going to be able to beat that? What's on your radar?"", ""Andy Cross: I got Landstar guys, LSTR, an asset-light logistics company that generates more than five billion in sales, market cap value almost seven billion more cash than debt. It's an asset-light business, so it doesn't really own a lot of the assets. It uses technology to help clients, which is more than 25,000 customers across 1,100 independent agents. Basically get our goods from point A to point Z. Mostly inter-modal trucking, van shipments but also some Aaron Freight."", ""They help make sense of all the logistics challenges to be able to get all our stuff from when we buy it to when we want to consume it. Now it's been a tough two years post-pandemic because we're not buying as much stuff. Inventories are going lower. Companies are trying to run down all those inventories. You're just not seeing the volumes come across their net worth. That's been a big hit to their sales and to their profits. But this is a very talented management team. They focus very heavily on returns on capital and free cash flow. Ultimately in a pretty good spot, I think for Landstar."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Landstar.', 'Dan Boyd: First off, absolutely gorgeous stock chart here for the maximum time since they came out in 1993, whatever, just up until the right you love to see it But this is one of those companies where you read about it and you got to read four paragraphs to figure out the day. Make technology or make programming to help people do trucking. Not crazy about this company.', ""Andy Cross: But that's the magic behind Dan. Two tough businesses this week, Dan, which one's going on your watchlist?"", ""Dan Boyd: Well, I'm not going with whatever Mattie said Come on. I don't even know what he was talking about."", ""Dylan Lewis: Landstar wins. Matt, Andy, I appreciate you being here. That's going to do it for us.

Regardless, each of the following names has Wall Street’s confidence, with most analysts recommending them as Buys. Therefore, let’s use TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to compare and contrast each entertainment play to see which one Wall Street is most bullish on.', 'First, let’s look at the at-home entertainment play Take-Two Interactive, which has been looking to gain ground over the past year after surrendering most of its pandemic-era gains in 2021 and 2022. Undoubtedly, the reopening of the economy meant video game firms were forced to compete with theme parks, concerts, and other “real-world” forms of entertainment again.', 'However, with inflation and layoffs continuing to have the potential to weigh on consumer balance sheets, I think at-home entertainment stocks could begin to gain the upper hand again.', 'When it comes to Take-Two, it has its long-awaited Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA VI) release up ahead, which could make the most of the opportunity at hand as it looks to entertain gamers with the next generation of its immersive open-world blockbuster title.', 'With mind-blowing water physics and gorgeous scenes revealed in the game’s first trailer, everyone is hyped and ready to hand over their money to Take-Two. I share the enthusiasm and am staying bullish on the name, regardless of when GTA VI actually ends up being released.', 'In any case, Take-Two stock recently hit a snag, as news broke that GTA VI could be delayed.

Gentlemen, great to have you both here."", 'Matt Argersinger: Hey, Dylan.', 'Andy Cross: Hey, Dylan.', ""Dylan Lewis: We've got a run-down on retail, the state of things at Paramount and of course, stocks on our radar. But we're kicking off with real estate news, Matt, after several years and lawsuits related to excessive fees and antitrust activity, we might be looking at a new real estate market."", ""Matt Argersinger: We might be, Dylan, if you ever sold a home. It's always been confounding well, at least for me, that in addition to paying a commission to your agent, in that case, the seller's agent or the listing agent, you'd also have to pay a 2.5, 3% commission to the buyer's agent. And this was essentially, for decades, a mandate of the National Association of Realtors, NAR, of which the vast majority of agents in the US are members of. It's why commissions on transacting home haven't traditionally been set in this 5-6% range, split evenly, usually by the seller's agent and the buyer's agent."", ""So instantaneously on every transaction, in addition to other closing costs, repair expenses, 5-6% of your homes' equity would instantly, that had been built up maybe for over many years, and worth tens of thousands of dollars would instantly go away for these commissions. It always seemed like one of the final areas of the market that had yet to be disrupted. Because if you think about what's happened to travel agents, what's happened to brokerage commissions, certainly transacting and almost everything in the country has gotten cheaper overtime except transacting a house."", ""If you look at the median price of a home in the US, right around $400,000, that's 20,000 or more in commissions just to sell a house. But here we are. The NAR has essentially settled, which means they are not contesting any more of these lawsuits, the civil action suits against them, they're paying a fee and the idea is that they're going to lose their monopoly position on the marketplace. Now, agents won't be required to be members of the NAR."", ""They won't be forced, for example, to subscribe to MLS listings already get paid and essentially makes real estate agents, free agents that can set their own commissions. And if you're a home seller, or a homebuyer, gives you far more negotiating power. You can pay a commission to a buyer that you want to pay, and it's no longer causing a mandate to pay a commission to the other side of the transaction."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, and looking at this news, I was trying to process both the news itself and then the follow-on impact that it would have. And I feel like for buyers and sellers, we're probably looking at lower fees and a little bit more flexibility. Beyond that in the business landscape of real estate, I feel like it's really hard to nail down what it means for companies like Zillow, Redfin, and other operators."", ""Matt Argersinger: I think clearly for the publicly traded agencies, this is not going to be great news. I mean, those fees are coming down, their margins have to come down. The business is going to change. There's going to be less agents in the marketplace. For companies like Redfin and Zillow, it is a little cloudy for me, because for one, Redfin who has already trying to disrupt the whole transaction fee of this marketplace anyway and with Zillow, Zillow really depends on the vast majority of its revenue still comes from agents who pays a low for leads on their marketplace."", ""They need agents, and they depend on the traditional model. So for Zillow, it's also could be disruptive, although a little confusing. I would just say this, good real estate agents do deserve to get paid. I don't want to make it seem like these commissions were being paid out the door for nothing. I mean, many work really hard. I've worked with agents that had been great. They spent a lot of time working with buyers or sellers, and they deal with a lot of paperwork. There's a lot of value to what they do. So I feel like it's still, in a way, it makes the marketplace better for them because I think good agents will thrive. Good agents will still get paid. A lot of agents who were just living off these richly undeserved agent commissions will not thrive."", ""Dylan Lewis: This week we've also got updates in AI sending tech companies in two different directions. We're going to kick off looking at Adobe here, Andy. Company reported earlier this week, results were good, but it seems like the guidance and the general outlook on how AI might be affecting the business has the market concerned."", ""Andy Cross: Yeah. Dylan, it's like that Damocles hanging over Adobe. AI is just waiting for that string to catch, to end up doing some serious damage to this company. This is a company that's been in investing in AI for a long time. Their Firefly solution, since its launch, now has more than 6.5 billion images created. They're investing in this space, and they talk a lot about this. However, even though that quarter was really quite good, revenues up 11%, adjusted earnings per share up 18%. They didn't have to pay a billion-dollar fee for the Figma transaction getting canceled. Their digital media revenue was up 12%."", ""Their ending annual recurring revenue, which is very important when you think about this business, up 14%. The Document Cloud business, which is part of their solutions and part of this package, was up 23%. So that's really impressive. Their digital experience revenue, that's their new marketing business they've been growing. That was up 10% with remaining performance obligations up 16%. So the quarter was all really positive, very good. However, it was all in the conversation about the guide in their future revenues, thinking about the bookings and how artificial intelligence is or is not impacting their business."", ""Especially it's things like OpenAI Sora, which is their text to video creating device and how much that's impacting, not just creating videos and imaging, but also giving clients the ability to edit those. Lots of conversations around what that means for their business. They didn't come out very enthusiastic about the guide going forward. Lots of conversations around with the analysts about what this means after minutia at the timings at this quarter, next quarter, a lot of concerns that so much of the growth of the year is going to be back-ended into the second half."", ""Clearly you see the stock reacting, more down 13% as we're going into tape this. The market clearly having some discussions and some hesitations about Adobe, which is the leader in this space. By the way, the stock has done very well over the last year. So I think the most pullback maybe a little ahead of itself and this is some of the pullback we're seeing."", ""Dylan Lewis: A different story with AI over at Oracle. This is a company that is catching the tailwinds of AI. Matt shares up 10% this week following the company's fiscal Q3 report. Thanks in large part to demand for the company's Cloud offerings."", ""Matt Argersinger: Absolutely. I mean, if you look at the headlines, revenue up 7%, adjusted EPS up 16%, both better-than-expected, but the two likely reasons, and you hit one of them, the stock has been up so much. First Oracle's remaining performance obligation, RPO, Andy mentioned this for Adobe as well. This is basically sales that Oracle is contractually obligated to fulfill, but hasn't yet quite recognize as revenue or if you're a simple investor like me, it's called backlog."", ""That's up to 80 billion, up 29% year over year. So that's just revenue growth is going to continue to be fairly robust going forward for Oracle. But the Cloud revenue for Oracle, 25% year over year, Cloud infrastructure business, 49% increase year over year. That's the piece that really competes with the bigger at Cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft's Azure."", ""You can conclude right there that Oracle is gaining market share. The big reason for that is a CEOs Safra Catz, demand for Oracle's Artificial Intelligence Cloud capabilities far exceeding supply. To address this, Oracle actually signed a new agreement with Nvidia in the quarter, investing heavily in opening and expanding its data center network. The AI plug in here for Oracle is very real and very robust, and it's got investors really excited about the business, obviously."", 'Dylan Lewis: Matt, right there, you name checked a lot of the big companies and brands that we associate with cloud discussion, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon. We have generally left Oracle out of the conversation for the big Cloud players, do you feel like we need to start bringing them into that group?', ""Matt Argersinger: I think so. This might eventually become a big four with Oracle. Because if you think on Oracle, all the other three companies that you mentioned all have big leads, big market shares, but they're also doing very different things in a lot of different markets. Amazon in particular, Alphabet of course, with advertising and YouTube. This is Oracle's business. I mean, database networking Cloud infrastructure is their business. It's their focus. I think they're going to continue to gain market share."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break over at Under Armour, it's meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis joined in studio with Matt Argersinger and Andy Cross. We've got a rundown on retail and apparel. We're going to start things off with Williams-Sonoma, a huge week for them, Andy, shares up 18% following the company's earnings release. Even though net income declined year over year and revenue was basically flat. Andy, what's going on here?"", ""Andy Cross: Well, on the earnings per share, because they buy back so much stock, it was actually up a little bit just 3%, but far ahead of analysts' estimates and the sales were down 7%. Again ahead of estimates was much better than how management had guided. Laura Alber has been leading Williams-Sonoma for so many years, so successfully years. I think very conservative when she thinks about running this company, she and her team. Been talking about the challenging market."", ""We're having comp sales down. Almost 7%, that was better than two years ago but worse than a year ago. The four-year company, you go back four years, Williams-Sonoma Lakes have focused on that pre-pandemic. They were up almost 30%. I mentioned the earnings per share, gross margins is where they won Dylan in this quarter. Higher merchandise margins, lower supply costs. Williams-Sonoma has been really effective at managing their supply costs."", ""Being very efficient as how they have taken out more and more costs from their supply chain, how the pricing is starting to impact that. They've been talking about that for the past year, which is one reason why their stock has done so well. That allows them to get more efficient when it comes at gross margin up at 46% versus 41% a year ago. The inventories were down 14%. Again, they're just managing this business, blocking and tackling very well."", ""Operating cash flow was up 60% for the year. But because they've been so efficient on their capital expenditure, free cash flow more than doubled, that allowed them to announce a 26% increase in the dividend certainly helps with the stock price performing so well. Even though comps really for the year where basically down across the board and for the quarter."", ""Dylan Lewis: Andy, this is probably not accompanying that a lot of people necessarily have on their radar and it is to their detriment. Shares up 140% over the last 12 months. It's been an incredible performer. The stock is currently at all-time highs for people that maybe haven't been following this business. Do you feel like the valuation is in a good spot or do you think it's getting a little rich?"", ""Andy Cross: Here's just some context behind that. I'm a fan of Williams-Sonoma and a shareholder and we've recommended the stock in lots of different spots here at The Motley Fool. The market cap is more than 18 billion. It sells at around an earnings multiple of around 20 times. Historically their earnings multiple is more in the low double-digits or call it the 12, 13, 15 times range. When it got so cheap, it got down to single digits, which is one reason why the stock has done so well. If you want to nibble, fine, don't go all rushing, but put it on your watchlist. Certainly, if you don't have it as one to keep an eye on."", 'Dylan Lewis: We have a less glamorous story going on over at Under Armour. News out this week that founder Kevin Plank will be stepping back into the CEO role and Matt, the market did not seem too excited about it.', ""Matt Argersinger: Not at all, Dylan. The stock sold off pretty hard. I think there's a few reasons for this, which we'll get into. One, it's interesting, the current or now former CEO, Stephanie Linnartz, she's only on the job for about a year and she was in the first year of what she thought was going to be a three-year turnaround for the business. Clearly, that turnaround is not happening to the satisfaction of the board and probably to a lot of investors."", ""But I just found that press release from Under Armour very short, very vague. I felt like this needed a letter from Kevin Plank saying why he's coming back, why he thinks it's important for him to step back into the CEO role. We didn't get that. We just got a pretty short press release. That's interesting. If you look at Under Armour stock, it's been stuck in the low single-digits for what seems like forever. Maybe there's a little bit of desperation here, but you have to remember how Plank left the CEO spot in 2019. Putting aside his various personal scandals, he didn't leave the company in exactly a great state."", ""Revenue growth had already flatlined for a few years, he made several poor acquisitions to try to digitize the brand. Inventory hadn't been managed well. They failed to gain traction at leisure market which I feel they basically invented it. Yet they see that to Lululemon and Nike and others. This isn't Steve Jobs coming back to the doors. This is not Howard Schultz coming in or Michael Dell coming back. A founder that's going to come back and lead the company to glory. I think that's why the market is taking a very cautious look here and saying this is a CEO with a pretty tumultuous tenure at the end. Coming back can a turnaround really happen now?"", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, I have not sold very many stocks that I've owned and when I have almost without exception, it has been the wrong decision. The exception to that is Under Armour. [laughs] I sold my shares, I think when it was in the mid-teens and this business has not managed to get back on track. It's down about 50% from then. Recently, shares are at their lowest level in almost a decade. What is the return to normal even look like for this business?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I don't know, Dylan. Unfortunately, I'm still a shareholder, and Under Armour withheld throughout. You see the stocks at a 10-year low. I looked at it. It's about a 17-year low in the stock price. But this is a situation where I step back and say, wait a second, how much worse can this actually get? Because if you look at Under Armour's stock, it's trading for about 0.6 times revenue. For comparison, Nike trades at three times revenue."", ""The stock's at a 17-year low. This is the kind that still generates healthy cash from operations. We were talking about before the show, that the brand has to have some equity value. That's probably greater or somewhere in the vicinity of three billion, which is its market cap. Maybe it can't get worse and just maybe Kevin Plank finds a little bit of that entrepreneurial magic he had early on in Under Armour. Three years from now, four years from now we're looking at Under Armour and it's $25 stock."", 'Andy Cross: Six dangerous words in an estimate. How much lower can this go? Just be mindful of that.', ""Dylan Lewis: You're pumping the brakes there a little bit there Andy."", 'Andy Cross: Be cautious there.', ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to wrap the company updates with a look at Ulta Andy, shares the cosmetic company down 5% after earnings. What's the story here?"", ""Andy Cross: It's interesting, the quarter was actually pretty good. It wasn't anything to really crow about. Revenues were up almost 10%. Earnings at $8.08 ahead of estimates so that was actually quite strong. Their comp sales were at 2.5% but that was versus 16% a year ago so a pretty good deceleration and a little bit lower than the estimates, which I think is what has the stock lower."", ""Transactions up 4.5% but pricing or average cost of the goods that someone buys down almost 2%. The gross margin was up a little bit. Lower shipping, better supply chain costs. Same thing was we sold Williams-Sonoma. I don't think quite as effective at Ulta, but a little bit better, but lower on the merchandise margin, which was different than what we saw at Williams-Sonoma. Sales gross and operating margin the cost down at 23.1% versus 23.6%."", ""They're doing a pretty good job of managing the cost that boosted the operating margin to 14.5% versus 13.9%. A lot of numbers there, but ultimately, they've done a pretty good job managing the cost in a relatively slower-growth business. Skincare up very much. One interesting little tidbit there. They talked about the sales for the makeup category decreased in low-single-digit range. They saw softness in prestige cosmetics was partially offset by growth in mass makeup. They pointed at Elf Beauty as one of the ones that are doing pretty well at Ulta."", ""Dylan Lewis: It's interesting. I haven't taken a look at the quarter, but I'm wondering if they said anything about shrink or anything like that, Andy. I don't know if you guys caught it, I only caught a little bit of it, but CNBC did this pretty large report this past week about retail theft. I can't remember the exact story, but I guess there was a ring of resellers who had stolen millions of dollars and Ulta is one of the big victims here of just ceiling this high-margin makeup, reselling it, pocketing the difference and I know they made some arrest. But it was a remarkable story."", ""Matt Argersinger: It was a huge enterprise, actually a criminal enterprise. Now I think this quarter didn't get nearly the tension as we've seen in the past. I think you'll see that they're starting to peak a little bit in there talking about shrink I think but it still continues to be an issue. The guidance, by the way, just very quickly is that comp sales at 4-5% versus 5.7%. That's for the full year guided ahead. Comp sales for this year ahead, not quite as good as last year."", ""Dylan Lewis: I'm glad you brought up the shrink story there, Matt because I remember looking at Target's results earlier this earnings season and I think it was two quarters ago, shrink was the narrative. They made that statement, I think it was a $500 million adjustment. Some of the numbers that they were looking out for the year saying that shrink was the culprit."", ""We didn't see a lot of headlines on that. We didn't see a lot of discussion of that with the most recent earnings release but we've actually dig into management's calls. It came up 12 times. It is still a story for some of these retailers and we're still hearing management talk about it but it seems like one of those things that has crested as a wave already when it comes to financials."", ""Matt Argersinger: When CNBC does a special report or in a special documentary and something that usually as Andy alluded to, it's looked at the peak but it might be one of those situations where hopefully companies are figuring it out and moving on."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt Argersinger, Andy Cross, fellows, we're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next, we dig into the turmoil at Paramount and the possible path forward for the entertainment giant. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Award season is over, but there's still plenty of drama unfolding in Hollywood. Motley Fool Money is Ricky Mulvey caught up with Bloomberg entertainment reporter Lucas Shaw for a look at the business of streaming, the power of incentives and corporate infighting at Paramount."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It's a tough time to be a movie company, but do you think there's starting to be a greater willingness to go for those singles and doubles now that there's some adult dramas that are doing poorly. Ferrari did not make money. But Anyone but You, which was a romantic comedy made more than 200 million at the box office. Like A24 eked out a profit with Iron Claw. So is that door continuing to open a little bit for those adult dramas that used to just go to streaming."", ""Lucas Shaw: I get very mixed signals on this and I think it's hard to answer that holistically. I don't think that these companies are giving up the Tentpole strategy, which is, let's have a handful of really expensive, really big movies. Because when those hit, they make so much money that it pays for everything else. They can't really move away from that for that reason. But you do see certain studios. I think Universal, Sony, and Warner Brothers, foremost among them making a wide range of movies, believing that there is value in having to use your metaphor, a single or a double, in addition to the home run."", ""If you look at the types of programming that Netflix is going to do, I think they are going to take fewer really big swings and make more movies. That cost in the 20-$100 million range, which is, I don't know that it's going to be a bunch of dramas. I think it's going to be comedy, and thriller, and action, and things like that. But I do think you'll see a good number of movies made that are in that middle that the big studios had really forsaken over the last several years."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, and I want to own a move to Paramount, which you covered in a story called How Paramount Became A Cautionary Tale Of The Streaming Wars. The only thing on their upcoming slate seems to be those big Tentpole films after the Bob Marley movie, and they did Mean Girls. But then upcoming it seems that it's a Transformers movie, they're going to do a PAW patrol movie and it's not these small movies. They might have trouble attracting creators right now to get those smaller to midsize movies for their studio."", ""Lucas Shaw: The problems at Paramount have made it very hard for that studio to do deals. I've spoken with executives there who've been very pleasantly surprised, I should say, at some of the talent who've reupped their relationships with the studio, including John Krasinski though, filmmaker of A Quiet Place. But you talked to a lot of producers and they're pretty clear that Paramount would be their last choice, both because it's a company that just hasn't made that many movies."", ""Other than basically Top Gun, hasn't delivered a lot of huge hits. But I think more than anything because of the uncertainty at the corporate level where you have a controlling shareholder in Shari Redstone who pretty clearly would like to sell the business, is looking for buyers, is struggling to find buyers. She's looking to exit, not because this is a great time to sell and you can get a great deal, but because the business has been declining and she wants to get out while she still can."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Can you take us into the informal auction going on for for Paramount right now. Where's that sit?"", ""Lucas Shaw: Actually, you know what? Let's let's take it back a step. I think Shari decided that she wanted to sell at some point last year. Some people say over the summer, some people say in the fall. Either way, she had been approached over the years by a few parties. She really started late last year talking to David Ellison, who runs a company called Skydance, whose father is Larry Ellison, one of the richest men in the world. David Ellison's company is a co-financier and producer of Top Gun, of the Mission Impossible movies, of Star Trek movies, all Paramount biggest franchises."", ""David Ellison would like to buy Shari Redstone out of National Amusements, which is the family holding company, a movie theater chain that has the stake in Paramount and then merge his company with Paramount. The challenge with this is that while that deal is great for Shari Redstone, it's not necessarily great for Paramount. I think there's some people who are skeptical about why you would want to merge with Skydance other than because David Ellison wants them to and there would certainly be a dispute over valuation."", ""So you've got Shari Redstone and her camp looking to see if there are other bidders. Because anytime you're trying to sell, you want to have multiple bidders so you can drive up the price. So she's talked to David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Brothers discovery. She's talked to Apollo, the private equity firm, and she's talked to some other potential buyers. At the same time, you've got the company of Paramount with advisors looking to see if there are other offers because they don't necessarily love this David Ellison idea."", ""That's the state of play. We know that David Ellison is interested and has at least made a preliminary offer. We know there have been conversations with a couple of other parties, but it's not clear that there is another tangible offer or real buyer on the table right now for the company. So it's an open question as to whether they're going to get a deal done."", 'Ricky Mulvey: In the past, Netflix was a part of the conversation. Warner Brothers discovery looked at it briefly.', ""Lucas Shaw: It should be noted. I should just on that point, that yes, Netflix has been part of the conversation, but Netflix was part of the conversation in so much as it wanted to buy just the studio, Paramount Pictures. I think there are a lot of entities that would be happy to buy just the studio because it's got a good library that they could exploit and film and television, it's got, honestly great real estate that lot in Hollywood alone is worth billions of dollars."", ""The problem is that if you're Shari Redstone and you don't want to sell just the studio because it's your most valuable asset. So then you're left with a bunch of stuff nobody wants. If you're a buyer, it's the stuff nobody wants. Like you don't necessarily want to take these declining cable networks. So it's going to be interesting to see Shari Redstone's probably going to have to sell at a discount to unload the stuff that nobody wants in order to unload the whole company."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It seems that there has been a little bit of pride when they've had offers on the table. BET was one of them where the deal is off by a billion dollars, so everybody walks away. Now Paramount may get to a point where there's no option other than the buyer that's willing to take on the company."", ""Lucas Shaw: Yeah. I mean, it's crazy that they almost sold. They could have sold BET, they could've sold Showtime. That would have raised enough money between the two of them. If they did the deals, they probably could've gotten 4.5-5 billion dollars, that would solved a lot of problems. They could have paid off a lot of debt. They could have funded a bunch of stuff for the streaming service and yeah, they just didn't want to do it."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Is the cardinal misstep that Paramount made with streaming, which is their main loser of money. Just that they were late to the party or were there other mistakes along the way?', ""Lucas Shaw: They were definitely late. But that was not the cardinal sin because every company was late and every company that went in is facing the same conundrum right now, whether it's Paramount, or Warner Brothers Discovery, or Disney, or in a lesser way, Comcast because there are more diversified enterprise. But entities that have a bunch of cable networks are just watching as they fall into the sea and their streaming service is not rising fast enough."", ""So should they have moved faster? Yes, Disney moved a little bit faster. Having a lot of the same problems. I think the issue is that this was always going to be painful and you have this incredibly lucrative business that was going away and entities that made a lot of money from that business were not going to rush to kill it. It's the the classic innovator's dilemma that people talk about. Netflix was able to come in as a new player and disrupt this business and none of the competition moved fast or move quickly enough to respond."", 'I do think that Paramount has made some specific missteps. I mean, you look at it and I should also say Paramount was hamstrung by the corporate infighting. There were two separate entities, CBS and Viacom, that the Redstones controlled. Shari Redstone had to spend many years fighting to cement family control over them in disputes with management of both companies, when she did actually put it together. That then took a while to make it happen. So there were a lot of hurdles to making it work. Then they spent a lot of money really quickly.', ""They didn't think about it. All these companies made the same mistake. They had to try to compress 15 years of Netflix's building into a short time frame and we can debate, is there any way in which that would have gone well? Or was it just a function of going late and I'm not sure the answer. I'm sure that there were sounder strategies with these companies. I also think that had they acted five-years earlier, there's no guarantee it would have worked."", ""Ricky Mulvey: On Paramount, Shari Redstone wants a buyer. What happens if Paramount doesn't find a buyer?"", ""Lucas Shaw: It's a good question. It's the one facing all of these enterprises. Then Shari faces a couple of options. She can stay the course and believe that we've suffered maximum pain right now and the streaming service is going to keep growing, or we're going to manage costs and we'll figure it out. I don't think Wall Street would be very happy to hear that because it isn't working right now. There's a strategy where they resort to selling individual pieces again or where they halt costs a bit more. Then there's a more dramatic one which some have proposed which I still don't see them doing."", ""But this notion of them becoming a pure arms dealer, which means that they shut down the streaming service and just be a studio and sell the others. But considering that that company makes basically all of its money from cable networks and to some extent from streaming. That's where most of the employees are. That would require, I should say, gutting the business. You'd fire 50-80% of the staff, which is why I see that is unlikely but she'll have to have to make some big changes if she cuts it because if they come out and say, they haven't officially said that they're for sale but if there was a bunch of coverage basically saying that the deal talks were over, their stocks is going to tank."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I think there's also an interesting angle on this with the power of incentives. I want to talk about David Zaslav in a sec, but in this case, there's an early misstep from the CEO, Philipe Dauman, this guy was making so much money in stock awards. He incentivized to boost the stock price and then in order to do so, he's buying back stock, which means they're not investing into content and growing the business for the long term."", ""Lucas Shaw: Philipe Dauman, really one of the worst media CEOs of the last 20-plus years, I would say. Maybe, ever. He took what was one of the most vibrant and great businesses, in Viacom, drove it into the ground. He didn't understand Netflix, he didn't understand YouTube and rather than invest a bunch of money in streaming, which he should've done because they had the networks that were most exposed. MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, they speak to young people so you could see the trends early. I"", 'nstead of investing in streaming, he just bought back a bunch of stock. He did whatever he could to prop up the share price and it was really destructive to the enterprise long term. All the mistakes that Shari Redstone and Bob Bakish may or may not have made Philipe made more. Sumner Redstone, who was in charge of the company at the time and was the was the owner, they deserve the largest share of the blame, no question.', ""Ricky Mulvey: I wonder if there's an incentive problem right now. If Warner Brothers discovery and you've talked about it on the town, where David Zaslav has compensation award tied to the free cash flow of the business. I was talking to one of our investment analysts, Tim Buyers earlier. Basically, that's an uncommon way to incentivize a CEO. Feel free to break down this theory but now you have HBO or the company that's essentially shelved movies, one of which recently was the Wiley Coyote vs Acme movie. You get a tax loss on that, which is going to boost. You get the immediate boost of free cash flow but then, you might be killing ideas, drawing away creators."", ""Lucas Shaw: It's a question of whether he's incentivized to just cut cost to make cash flow look good and get himself paid more rather than act in the best interest of the company. It's a tough press. I don't think that David Zaslav made free cash and the Board made free cash flow the most important metric for his pay just because they knew that they were going to cut costs. I think they wanted to set the target. We have all this debt and we need to save money to pay it off. How are we going to incentivize people to do that? We're going to incentivize them to generate free cash flow and that's what they did."", ""That being said, it's just a terrible look for this guy who's about to get paid a ton of money, even though their stock is in the toilet, nobody thinks the company is performing very well. By the way, that free cash flow being the metric for performance and how people are paid, that doesn't apply to most of the employees of that company. It mostly applies to David Zaslav and maybe the inner circle. They're really perverse incentives there."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Listeners, you can catch Lucas Shaw on X. He is @Lucas_Shaw. Coming up after the break, Andy Cross and Matt Argersinger return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Dylan Lewis: As always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis joined again by Matt Argersinger and Andy Cross. If you went all in on the Stanley tumbler craze, you're going to have to make room in your cupboard for another weird household item that has caught fire. Andy, grocer Trader Joe's began selling mini tote bags for $3 in March. They are now selling for hundreds of dollars online. What are you make of this new consumer craze?"", ""Andy Cross: How many is many on the per square inch of tote bags? This has got to be a record if they're really small. We just bought a Stanley for $35 at REI and those things are some serious piece of hardware. We're now part of the Stanley craze, I think we have two of them now at the house so I can understand that. If it's me, when I go to Trader Joe's, I buy a lot of stuff. I'm bringing tote bags, hanging them on my shoulder, pulling them out of my jackets. Minis are not helping me very much."", 'Dylan Lewis: I think you timed the market well on that. I think you got in on the tumblers slightly after the peak and maybe have a good cost basis there. Matt, what do you make of these consumer phrases?', ""Matt Argersinger: I can't speak to this.

Matt, you're up first this week, what are you looking at?"", ""Matt Argersinger: Weird special situation here, Equity Commonwealth, the ticker is EQC. Equity Commonwealth, it's a two billion dollar real estate investment trust with 2.2 billion in net cash. Do the math there. Yes, it's trading below the cash on its balance sheet. Now it does own four office buildings that are cash-flowing but materially they're a very small part of the story here. Management is essentially sitting on 2.2 billion in cash collecting 5% with treasuries, which is good but waiting to make a transformative investment for the business."", ""The problem is they've been sitting on their hands for quite a while now. Investors are starting to get a little impatient and now there's a hedge fund called Land and Buildings Investment Management, LLC. That's a mouthful them but they own 3% of EQC shares, and they've submitted a letter demanding that EQC actually liquidate the business because under their model, liquidating the business would actually result in a net asset value of about 20% above where EQC is trading in the public markets. We'll have to see if this gets any traction. But I think it's a fastening situation to watch over the next few months."", ""Dylan Lewis: Dan, a special situation with Equity Commonwealth. What's your question?"", ""Dan Boyd: A special situation is called for, it doesn't make any dang sense. I'm sorry, are you trying to sell us on cash or office buildings, Mattie?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I think cash but it sounds like I'm actually trying to sell Dan a tote bag from Trader Joe's Andy, you're going to be able to beat that? What's on your radar?"", ""Andy Cross: I got Landstar guys, LSTR, an asset-light logistics company that generates more than five billion in sales, market cap value almost seven billion more cash than debt. It's an asset-light business, so it doesn't really own a lot of the assets. It uses technology to help clients, which is more than 25,000 customers across 1,100 independent agents. Basically get our goods from point A to point Z. Mostly inter-modal trucking, van shipments but also some Aaron Freight."", ""They help make sense of all the logistics challenges to be able to get all our stuff from when we buy it to when we want to consume it. Now it's been a tough two years post-pandemic because we're not buying as much stuff. Inventories are going lower. Companies are trying to run down all those inventories. You're just not seeing the volumes come across their net worth. That's been a big hit to their sales and to their profits. But this is a very talented management team. They focus very heavily on returns on capital and free cash flow. Ultimately in a pretty good spot, I think for Landstar."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Landstar.', 'Dan Boyd: First off, absolutely gorgeous stock chart here for the maximum time since they came out in 1993, whatever, just up until the right you love to see it But this is one of those companies where you read about it and you got to read four paragraphs to figure out the day.

This is really an effort to turn off the tap.”', 'Test kits retail for $4,000 to $5,000 through James Heal. “They take up less space, they’re scalable, and we want to evolve it with the help of the industry,” he added. “The ask that we have is, ‘Come use the method.’”', 'Collaboration has also led to the development of a next-generation material that the company believes has the potential to replace traditional stretch technology.', 'Through a partnership with North Carolina State University and chemicals and materials solutions provider Celanese, Under Armour has “come up with a material that provides the stretch in fabrics that Spandex currently provides, but has the ability… to be recyclable,” Levine said. “It gets rid of also some very harmful solvents earlier in the process, and we think that’s a win.”', 'According to the VP, the material, dubbed NeoLast, will make its first appearance over the course of the next year, and a small amount will be made available commercially as well.', '“I want to stress here that we think this has a lot of potential, and it’s an innovation that we’re not keeping as an Under Armour innovation… it’s going to be open to industry use,” he added. “Our hope is that we’ll find ways to use it in increasing concentrations and products, and work with others to bring infrastructure to bear that will scale it.”']"

Additionally, the report also adds that the US insurance industry ended up underwriting $33 billion in losses in 2023, making it unsurprising that the Florida insurance industry is now a significantly different sector than it was at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.', ""Yet, while the US casualty insurance industry might be out of trouble for now, the first quarter of 2023 has also seen another sector become the center of media attention. This is the health insurance sector that seemingly got caught in the middle of a feud between law enforcement and ransomware organizations. One of America's biggest insurance companies, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), saw its claims processing disrupted in a cyberattack that saw reverberations all over America. This wasn't the end of the intrigue, as while UNH has since recovered, the group said to be responsible for the attack has pulled off a disappearing act."", ""According to Reuters, the ransomware group BlackHat's website now claims that the group has been taken down by coordinated action from law enforcement agencies. However, all agencies mentioned have either refused or failed to comment or outright denied disrupting the infrastructure."", 'Thought only casualty and health insurance were facing disruptions? Think again as March 2024 has also seen Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company inform nearly 30,000 customers that a data breach led to sensitive details such as Social Security numbers being compromised.

To add to this, the collapse of the Francis Scott Bridge in Baltimore is also making marine insurers tremble. Experts believe that the partial bridge collapse could set new records in marine insurance, and some estimates believe that a payout could sit at a whopping $4 billion.', 'So, as the US insurance battles new challenges in the age of artificial intelligence, we decided to see which insurance companies in America have the greatest assets.

They are highly volatile businesses because the oil and natural gas they produce drive their top and bottom lines.', 'Oil and natural gas are prone to swift and dramatic price swings. There are all sorts of reasons for this, including the impact of supply and demand, changes in world economic growth, and even geopolitical conflict.', ""But it doesn't really matter why oil and natural gas prices weave and bob; as an investor, you simply have to go in knowing that volatility is the norm. And that has the exact impact you would expect on Devon, Pioneer, and Diamondback since the only thing they do is produce oil and natural gas."", 'That said, each of these dividend payers has chosen to adopt a dividend policy that rewards investors when energy prices are rising. They each have a ""base plus variable"" dividend policy that is tied to their financial performance. The base dividend ensures some stability in its payout. That\'s actually a pretty good way to ensure that investors directly benefit from high oil and natural gas prices, since higher energy prices lead to dividend increases.', ""But there's a trade-off. When energy prices fall, the variable part of the dividend gets cut. So by design, Devon, Pioneer, and Diamondback are going to fall short if you buy any of them believing that the yield you see is a reliable indicator of the future income you will collect from owning them. The dividend yield in each of the company profile images here shows the yield of the base dividend. That should give you a better idea of what these payouts look like without the variable dividend."", 'The chart below -- with the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, a key industry benchmark, and the dividend histories of Devon, Pioneer, and Diamondback -- shows very clearly what the variable dividend policies mean in real life. As WTI rose, so, too, did the dividend payments made by this trio of energy producers. But when oil prices started to fall -- well, the dividends went along for the ride.', 'This is exactly what you would expect given their dividend policies. And to be fair, the dividends have been heading higher again along with energy prices. That will probably get some dividend investors excited about the future income prospects here.', ""But don't fall for this trap if you are looking for reliable dividend payers. By design, Devon, Pioneer, and Diamondback are inherently unreliable."", ""That doesn't mean that they are bad companies. That's something you need to decide on a company-by-company basis by examining their unique business fundamentals. But the volatile nature of energy prices means that dividend cuts are inevitable as long as they have variable dividend policies in place."", 'If you are looking at the energy sector in an attempt to find a high-yield dividend stock, you will probably see Devon, Pioneer, and Diamondback pop up on your screens. Their yields are currently elevated relative to the broader energy sector.', ""But that's something of a mirage based on the way in which they have designed their businesses. A big yield that doesn't last won't be a worthwhile investment for most dividend investors trying to live off the income from their portfolios.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.', ""So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like United Rentals (NYSE:URI).

That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Recognition must be given to the that United Rentals has grown EPS by 43% per year, over the last three years. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.', ""It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth.

We note that this amounts to 0.5% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of United Rentals but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value."", ""United Rentals' earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate.

But we're kicking off with real estate news, Matt, after several years and lawsuits related to excessive fees and antitrust activity, we might be looking at a new real estate market."", ""Matt Argersinger: We might be, Dylan, if you ever sold a home. It's always been confounding well, at least for me, that in addition to paying a commission to your agent, in that case, the seller's agent or the listing agent, you'd also have to pay a 2.5, 3% commission to the buyer's agent. And this was essentially, for decades, a mandate of the National Association of Realtors, NAR, of which the vast majority of agents in the US are members of. It's why commissions on transacting home haven't traditionally been set in this 5-6% range, split evenly, usually by the seller's agent and the buyer's agent."", ""So instantaneously on every transaction, in addition to other closing costs, repair expenses, 5-6% of your homes' equity would instantly, that had been built up maybe for over many years, and worth tens of thousands of dollars would instantly go away for these commissions. It always seemed like one of the final areas of the market that had yet to be disrupted. Because if you think about what's happened to travel agents, what's happened to brokerage commissions, certainly transacting and almost everything in the country has gotten cheaper overtime except transacting a house."", ""If you look at the median price of a home in the US, right around $400,000, that's 20,000 or more in commissions just to sell a house. But here we are. The NAR has essentially settled, which means they are not contesting any more of these lawsuits, the civil action suits against them, they're paying a fee and the idea is that they're going to lose their monopoly position on the marketplace. Now, agents won't be required to be members of the NAR."", ""They won't be forced, for example, to subscribe to MLS listings already get paid and essentially makes real estate agents, free agents that can set their own commissions. And if you're a home seller, or a homebuyer, gives you far more negotiating power. You can pay a commission to a buyer that you want to pay, and it's no longer causing a mandate to pay a commission to the other side of the transaction."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, and looking at this news, I was trying to process both the news itself and then the follow-on impact that it would have. And I feel like for buyers and sellers, we're probably looking at lower fees and a little bit more flexibility. Beyond that in the business landscape of real estate, I feel like it's really hard to nail down what it means for companies like Zillow, Redfin, and other operators."", ""Matt Argersinger: I think clearly for the publicly traded agencies, this is not going to be great news. I mean, those fees are coming down, their margins have to come down. The business is going to change. There's going to be less agents in the marketplace. For companies like Redfin and Zillow, it is a little cloudy for me, because for one, Redfin who has already trying to disrupt the whole transaction fee of this marketplace anyway and with Zillow, Zillow really depends on the vast majority of its revenue still comes from agents who pays a low for leads on their marketplace."", ""They need agents, and they depend on the traditional model. So for Zillow, it's also could be disruptive, although a little confusing. I would just say this, good real estate agents do deserve to get paid. I don't want to make it seem like these commissions were being paid out the door for nothing. I mean, many work really hard. I've worked with agents that had been great. They spent a lot of time working with buyers or sellers, and they deal with a lot of paperwork. There's a lot of value to what they do. So I feel like it's still, in a way, it makes the marketplace better for them because I think good agents will thrive. Good agents will still get paid. A lot of agents who were just living off these richly undeserved agent commissions will not thrive."", ""Dylan Lewis: This week we've also got updates in AI sending tech companies in two different directions. We're going to kick off looking at Adobe here, Andy. Company reported earlier this week, results were good, but it seems like the guidance and the general outlook on how AI might be affecting the business has the market concerned."", ""Andy Cross: Yeah. Dylan, it's like that Damocles hanging over Adobe. AI is just waiting for that string to catch, to end up doing some serious damage to this company. This is a company that's been in investing in AI for a long time. Their Firefly solution, since its launch, now has more than 6.5 billion images created. They're investing in this space, and they talk a lot about this. However, even though that quarter was really quite good, revenues up 11%, adjusted earnings per share up 18%. They didn't have to pay a billion-dollar fee for the Figma transaction getting canceled. Their digital media revenue was up 12%."", ""Their ending annual recurring revenue, which is very important when you think about this business, up 14%. The Document Cloud business, which is part of their solutions and part of this package, was up 23%. So that's really impressive. Their digital experience revenue, that's their new marketing business they've been growing. That was up 10% with remaining performance obligations up 16%. So the quarter was all really positive, very good. However, it was all in the conversation about the guide in their future revenues, thinking about the bookings and how artificial intelligence is or is not impacting their business."", ""Especially it's things like OpenAI Sora, which is their text to video creating device and how much that's impacting, not just creating videos and imaging, but also giving clients the ability to edit those. Lots of conversations around what that means for their business. They didn't come out very enthusiastic about the guide going forward. Lots of conversations around with the analysts about what this means after minutia at the timings at this quarter, next quarter, a lot of concerns that so much of the growth of the year is going to be back-ended into the second half."", ""Clearly you see the stock reacting, more down 13% as we're going into tape this. The market clearly having some discussions and some hesitations about Adobe, which is the leader in this space. By the way, the stock has done very well over the last year. So I think the most pullback maybe a little ahead of itself and this is some of the pullback we're seeing."", ""Dylan Lewis: A different story with AI over at Oracle. This is a company that is catching the tailwinds of AI. Matt shares up 10% this week following the company's fiscal Q3 report. Thanks in large part to demand for the company's Cloud offerings."", ""Matt Argersinger: Absolutely. I mean, if you look at the headlines, revenue up 7%, adjusted EPS up 16%, both better-than-expected, but the two likely reasons, and you hit one of them, the stock has been up so much. First Oracle's remaining performance obligation, RPO, Andy mentioned this for Adobe as well. This is basically sales that Oracle is contractually obligated to fulfill, but hasn't yet quite recognize as revenue or if you're a simple investor like me, it's called backlog."", ""That's up to 80 billion, up 29% year over year. So that's just revenue growth is going to continue to be fairly robust going forward for Oracle. But the Cloud revenue for Oracle, 25% year over year, Cloud infrastructure business, 49% increase year over year. That's the piece that really competes with the bigger at Cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft's Azure."", ""You can conclude right there that Oracle is gaining market share. The big reason for that is a CEOs Safra Catz, demand for Oracle's Artificial Intelligence Cloud capabilities far exceeding supply. To address this, Oracle actually signed a new agreement with Nvidia in the quarter, investing heavily in opening and expanding its data center network. The AI plug in here for Oracle is very real and very robust, and it's got investors really excited about the business, obviously."", 'Dylan Lewis: Matt, right there, you name checked a lot of the big companies and brands that we associate with cloud discussion, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon. We have generally left Oracle out of the conversation for the big Cloud players, do you feel like we need to start bringing them into that group?', ""Matt Argersinger: I think so. This might eventually become a big four with Oracle. Because if you think on Oracle, all the other three companies that you mentioned all have big leads, big market shares, but they're also doing very different things in a lot of different markets. Amazon in particular, Alphabet of course, with advertising and YouTube. This is Oracle's business. I mean, database networking Cloud infrastructure is their business. It's their focus. I think they're going to continue to gain market share."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break over at Under Armour, it's meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis joined in studio with Matt Argersinger and Andy Cross. We've got a rundown on retail and apparel. We're going to start things off with Williams-Sonoma, a huge week for them, Andy, shares up 18% following the company's earnings release. Even though net income declined year over year and revenue was basically flat. Andy, what's going on here?"", ""Andy Cross: Well, on the earnings per share, because they buy back so much stock, it was actually up a little bit just 3%, but far ahead of analysts' estimates and the sales were down 7%. Again ahead of estimates was much better than how management had guided. Laura Alber has been leading Williams-Sonoma for so many years, so successfully years. I think very conservative when she thinks about running this company, she and her team. Been talking about the challenging market."", ""We're having comp sales down. Almost 7%, that was better than two years ago but worse than a year ago. The four-year company, you go back four years, Williams-Sonoma Lakes have focused on that pre-pandemic. They were up almost 30%. I mentioned the earnings per share, gross margins is where they won Dylan in this quarter. Higher merchandise margins, lower supply costs. Williams-Sonoma has been really effective at managing their supply costs."", ""Being very efficient as how they have taken out more and more costs from their supply chain, how the pricing is starting to impact that. They've been talking about that for the past year, which is one reason why their stock has done so well. That allows them to get more efficient when it comes at gross margin up at 46% versus 41% a year ago. The inventories were down 14%. Again, they're just managing this business, blocking and tackling very well."", ""Operating cash flow was up 60% for the year. But because they've been so efficient on their capital expenditure, free cash flow more than doubled, that allowed them to announce a 26% increase in the dividend certainly helps with the stock price performing so well. Even though comps really for the year where basically down across the board and for the quarter."", ""Dylan Lewis: Andy, this is probably not accompanying that a lot of people necessarily have on their radar and it is to their detriment. Shares up 140% over the last 12 months. It's been an incredible performer. The stock is currently at all-time highs for people that maybe haven't been following this business. Do you feel like the valuation is in a good spot or do you think it's getting a little rich?"", ""Andy Cross: Here's just some context behind that. I'm a fan of Williams-Sonoma and a shareholder and we've recommended the stock in lots of different spots here at The Motley Fool. The market cap is more than 18 billion. It sells at around an earnings multiple of around 20 times. Historically their earnings multiple is more in the low double-digits or call it the 12, 13, 15 times range. When it got so cheap, it got down to single digits, which is one reason why the stock has done so well. If you want to nibble, fine, don't go all rushing, but put it on your watchlist. Certainly, if you don't have it as one to keep an eye on."", 'Dylan Lewis: We have a less glamorous story going on over at Under Armour. News out this week that founder Kevin Plank will be stepping back into the CEO role and Matt, the market did not seem too excited about it.', ""Matt Argersinger: Not at all, Dylan. The stock sold off pretty hard. I think there's a few reasons for this, which we'll get into. One, it's interesting, the current or now former CEO, Stephanie Linnartz, she's only on the job for about a year and she was in the first year of what she thought was going to be a three-year turnaround for the business. Clearly, that turnaround is not happening to the satisfaction of the board and probably to a lot of investors."", ""But I just found that press release from Under Armour very short, very vague. I felt like this needed a letter from Kevin Plank saying why he's coming back, why he thinks it's important for him to step back into the CEO role. We didn't get that. We just got a pretty short press release. That's interesting. If you look at Under Armour stock, it's been stuck in the low single-digits for what seems like forever. Maybe there's a little bit of desperation here, but you have to remember how Plank left the CEO spot in 2019. Putting aside his various personal scandals, he didn't leave the company in exactly a great state."", ""Revenue growth had already flatlined for a few years, he made several poor acquisitions to try to digitize the brand. Inventory hadn't been managed well. They failed to gain traction at leisure market which I feel they basically invented it. Yet they see that to Lululemon and Nike and others. This isn't Steve Jobs coming back to the doors. This is not Howard Schultz coming in or Michael Dell coming back. A founder that's going to come back and lead the company to glory. I think that's why the market is taking a very cautious look here and saying this is a CEO with a pretty tumultuous tenure at the end. Coming back can a turnaround really happen now?"", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, I have not sold very many stocks that I've owned and when I have almost without exception, it has been the wrong decision. The exception to that is Under Armour. [laughs] I sold my shares, I think when it was in the mid-teens and this business has not managed to get back on track. It's down about 50% from then. Recently, shares are at their lowest level in almost a decade. What is the return to normal even look like for this business?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I don't know, Dylan. Unfortunately, I'm still a shareholder, and Under Armour withheld throughout. You see the stocks at a 10-year low. I looked at it. It's about a 17-year low in the stock price. But this is a situation where I step back and say, wait a second, how much worse can this actually get? Because if you look at Under Armour's stock, it's trading for about 0.6 times revenue. For comparison, Nike trades at three times revenue."", ""The stock's at a 17-year low. This is the kind that still generates healthy cash from operations. We were talking about before the show, that the brand has to have some equity value. That's probably greater or somewhere in the vicinity of three billion, which is its market cap. Maybe it can't get worse and just maybe Kevin Plank finds a little bit of that entrepreneurial magic he had early on in Under Armour. Three years from now, four years from now we're looking at Under Armour and it's $25 stock."", 'Andy Cross: Six dangerous words in an estimate. How much lower can this go? Just be mindful of that.', ""Dylan Lewis: You're pumping the brakes there a little bit there Andy."", 'Andy Cross: Be cautious there.', ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to wrap the company updates with a look at Ulta Andy, shares the cosmetic company down 5% after earnings. What's the story here?"", ""Andy Cross: It's interesting, the quarter was actually pretty good. It wasn't anything to really crow about. Revenues were up almost 10%. Earnings at $8.08 ahead of estimates so that was actually quite strong. Their comp sales were at 2.5% but that was versus 16% a year ago so a pretty good deceleration and a little bit lower than the estimates, which I think is what has the stock lower."", ""Transactions up 4.5% but pricing or average cost of the goods that someone buys down almost 2%. The gross margin was up a little bit. Lower shipping, better supply chain costs. Same thing was we sold Williams-Sonoma. I don't think quite as effective at Ulta, but a little bit better, but lower on the merchandise margin, which was different than what we saw at Williams-Sonoma. Sales gross and operating margin the cost down at 23.1% versus 23.6%."", ""They're doing a pretty good job of managing the cost that boosted the operating margin to 14.5% versus 13.9%. A lot of numbers there, but ultimately, they've done a pretty good job managing the cost in a relatively slower-growth business. Skincare up very much. One interesting little tidbit there. They talked about the sales for the makeup category decreased in low-single-digit range. They saw softness in prestige cosmetics was partially offset by growth in mass makeup. They pointed at Elf Beauty as one of the ones that are doing pretty well at Ulta."", ""Dylan Lewis: It's interesting. I haven't taken a look at the quarter, but I'm wondering if they said anything about shrink or anything like that, Andy. I don't know if you guys caught it, I only caught a little bit of it, but CNBC did this pretty large report this past week about retail theft. I can't remember the exact story, but I guess there was a ring of resellers who had stolen millions of dollars and Ulta is one of the big victims here of just ceiling this high-margin makeup, reselling it, pocketing the difference and I know they made some arrest. But it was a remarkable story."", ""Matt Argersinger: It was a huge enterprise, actually a criminal enterprise. Now I think this quarter didn't get nearly the tension as we've seen in the past. I think you'll see that they're starting to peak a little bit in there talking about shrink I think but it still continues to be an issue. The guidance, by the way, just very quickly is that comp sales at 4-5% versus 5.7%. That's for the full year guided ahead. Comp sales for this year ahead, not quite as good as last year."", ""Dylan Lewis: I'm glad you brought up the shrink story there, Matt because I remember looking at Target's results earlier this earnings season and I think it was two quarters ago, shrink was the narrative. They made that statement, I think it was a $500 million adjustment. Some of the numbers that they were looking out for the year saying that shrink was the culprit."", ""We didn't see a lot of headlines on that. We didn't see a lot of discussion of that with the most recent earnings release but we've actually dig into management's calls. It came up 12 times. It is still a story for some of these retailers and we're still hearing management talk about it but it seems like one of those things that has crested as a wave already when it comes to financials."", ""Matt Argersinger: When CNBC does a special report or in a special documentary and something that usually as Andy alluded to, it's looked at the peak but it might be one of those situations where hopefully companies are figuring it out and moving on."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt Argersinger, Andy Cross, fellows, we're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next, we dig into the turmoil at Paramount and the possible path forward for the entertainment giant. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Award season is over, but there's still plenty of drama unfolding in Hollywood. Motley Fool Money is Ricky Mulvey caught up with Bloomberg entertainment reporter Lucas Shaw for a look at the business of streaming, the power of incentives and corporate infighting at Paramount."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It's a tough time to be a movie company, but do you think there's starting to be a greater willingness to go for those singles and doubles now that there's some adult dramas that are doing poorly. Ferrari did not make money. But Anyone but You, which was a romantic comedy made more than 200 million at the box office. Like A24 eked out a profit with Iron Claw. So is that door continuing to open a little bit for those adult dramas that used to just go to streaming."", ""Lucas Shaw: I get very mixed signals on this and I think it's hard to answer that holistically. I don't think that these companies are giving up the Tentpole strategy, which is, let's have a handful of really expensive, really big movies. Because when those hit, they make so much money that it pays for everything else. They can't really move away from that for that reason. But you do see certain studios. I think Universal, Sony, and Warner Brothers, foremost among them making a wide range of movies, believing that there is value in having to use your metaphor, a single or a double, in addition to the home run."", ""If you look at the types of programming that Netflix is going to do, I think they are going to take fewer really big swings and make more movies. That cost in the 20-$100 million range, which is, I don't know that it's going to be a bunch of dramas. I think it's going to be comedy, and thriller, and action, and things like that. But I do think you'll see a good number of movies made that are in that middle that the big studios had really forsaken over the last several years."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Yeah, and I want to own a move to Paramount, which you covered in a story called How Paramount Became A Cautionary Tale Of The Streaming Wars. The only thing on their upcoming slate seems to be those big Tentpole films after the Bob Marley movie, and they did Mean Girls. But then upcoming it seems that it's a Transformers movie, they're going to do a PAW patrol movie and it's not these small movies. They might have trouble attracting creators right now to get those smaller to midsize movies for their studio."", ""Lucas Shaw: The problems at Paramount have made it very hard for that studio to do deals. I've spoken with executives there who've been very pleasantly surprised, I should say, at some of the talent who've reupped their relationships with the studio, including John Krasinski though, filmmaker of A Quiet Place. But you talked to a lot of producers and they're pretty clear that Paramount would be their last choice, both because it's a company that just hasn't made that many movies."", ""Other than basically Top Gun, hasn't delivered a lot of huge hits. But I think more than anything because of the uncertainty at the corporate level where you have a controlling shareholder in Shari Redstone who pretty clearly would like to sell the business, is looking for buyers, is struggling to find buyers. She's looking to exit, not because this is a great time to sell and you can get a great deal, but because the business has been declining and she wants to get out while she still can."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Can you take us into the informal auction going on for for Paramount right now. Where's that sit?"", ""Lucas Shaw: Actually, you know what? Let's let's take it back a step. I think Shari decided that she wanted to sell at some point last year. Some people say over the summer, some people say in the fall. Either way, she had been approached over the years by a few parties. She really started late last year talking to David Ellison, who runs a company called Skydance, whose father is Larry Ellison, one of the richest men in the world. David Ellison's company is a co-financier and producer of Top Gun, of the Mission Impossible movies, of Star Trek movies, all Paramount biggest franchises."", ""David Ellison would like to buy Shari Redstone out of National Amusements, which is the family holding company, a movie theater chain that has the stake in Paramount and then merge his company with Paramount. The challenge with this is that while that deal is great for Shari Redstone, it's not necessarily great for Paramount. I think there's some people who are skeptical about why you would want to merge with Skydance other than because David Ellison wants them to and there would certainly be a dispute over valuation."", ""So you've got Shari Redstone and her camp looking to see if there are other bidders. Because anytime you're trying to sell, you want to have multiple bidders so you can drive up the price. So she's talked to David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Brothers discovery. She's talked to Apollo, the private equity firm, and she's talked to some other potential buyers. At the same time, you've got the company of Paramount with advisors looking to see if there are other offers because they don't necessarily love this David Ellison idea."", ""That's the state of play. We know that David Ellison is interested and has at least made a preliminary offer. We know there have been conversations with a couple of other parties, but it's not clear that there is another tangible offer or real buyer on the table right now for the company. So it's an open question as to whether they're going to get a deal done."", 'Ricky Mulvey: In the past, Netflix was a part of the conversation. Warner Brothers discovery looked at it briefly.', ""Lucas Shaw: It should be noted. I should just on that point, that yes, Netflix has been part of the conversation, but Netflix was part of the conversation in so much as it wanted to buy just the studio, Paramount Pictures. I think there are a lot of entities that would be happy to buy just the studio because it's got a good library that they could exploit and film and television, it's got, honestly great real estate that lot in Hollywood alone is worth billions of dollars."", ""The problem is that if you're Shari Redstone and you don't want to sell just the studio because it's your most valuable asset. So then you're left with a bunch of stuff nobody wants. If you're a buyer, it's the stuff nobody wants. Like you don't necessarily want to take these declining cable networks. So it's going to be interesting to see Shari Redstone's probably going to have to sell at a discount to unload the stuff that nobody wants in order to unload the whole company."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It seems that there has been a little bit of pride when they've had offers on the table. BET was one of them where the deal is off by a billion dollars, so everybody walks away. Now Paramount may get to a point where there's no option other than the buyer that's willing to take on the company."", ""Lucas Shaw: Yeah. I mean, it's crazy that they almost sold. They could have sold BET, they could've sold Showtime. That would have raised enough money between the two of them. If they did the deals, they probably could've gotten 4.5-5 billion dollars, that would solved a lot of problems. They could have paid off a lot of debt. They could have funded a bunch of stuff for the streaming service and yeah, they just didn't want to do it."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Is the cardinal misstep that Paramount made with streaming, which is their main loser of money. Just that they were late to the party or were there other mistakes along the way?', ""Lucas Shaw: They were definitely late. But that was not the cardinal sin because every company was late and every company that went in is facing the same conundrum right now, whether it's Paramount, or Warner Brothers Discovery, or Disney, or in a lesser way, Comcast because there are more diversified enterprise. But entities that have a bunch of cable networks are just watching as they fall into the sea and their streaming service is not rising fast enough."", ""So should they have moved faster? Yes, Disney moved a little bit faster. Having a lot of the same problems. I think the issue is that this was always going to be painful and you have this incredibly lucrative business that was going away and entities that made a lot of money from that business were not going to rush to kill it. It's the the classic innovator's dilemma that people talk about. Netflix was able to come in as a new player and disrupt this business and none of the competition moved fast or move quickly enough to respond."", 'I do think that Paramount has made some specific missteps. I mean, you look at it and I should also say Paramount was hamstrung by the corporate infighting. There were two separate entities, CBS and Viacom, that the Redstones controlled. Shari Redstone had to spend many years fighting to cement family control over them in disputes with management of both companies, when she did actually put it together. That then took a while to make it happen. So there were a lot of hurdles to making it work. Then they spent a lot of money really quickly.', ""They didn't think about it. All these companies made the same mistake. They had to try to compress 15 years of Netflix's building into a short time frame and we can debate, is there any way in which that would have gone well? Or was it just a function of going late and I'm not sure the answer. I'm sure that there were sounder strategies with these companies. I also think that had they acted five-years earlier, there's no guarantee it would have worked."", ""Ricky Mulvey: On Paramount, Shari Redstone wants a buyer. What happens if Paramount doesn't find a buyer?"", ""Lucas Shaw: It's a good question. It's the one facing all of these enterprises. Then Shari faces a couple of options. She can stay the course and believe that we've suffered maximum pain right now and the streaming service is going to keep growing, or we're going to manage costs and we'll figure it out. I don't think Wall Street would be very happy to hear that because it isn't working right now. There's a strategy where they resort to selling individual pieces again or where they halt costs a bit more. Then there's a more dramatic one which some have proposed which I still don't see them doing."", ""But this notion of them becoming a pure arms dealer, which means that they shut down the streaming service and just be a studio and sell the others. But considering that that company makes basically all of its money from cable networks and to some extent from streaming. That's where most of the employees are. That would require, I should say, gutting the business. You'd fire 50-80% of the staff, which is why I see that is unlikely but she'll have to have to make some big changes if she cuts it because if they come out and say, they haven't officially said that they're for sale but if there was a bunch of coverage basically saying that the deal talks were over, their stocks is going to tank."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I think there's also an interesting angle on this with the power of incentives. I want to talk about David Zaslav in a sec, but in this case, there's an early misstep from the CEO, Philipe Dauman, this guy was making so much money in stock awards. He incentivized to boost the stock price and then in order to do so, he's buying back stock, which means they're not investing into content and growing the business for the long term."", ""Lucas Shaw: Philipe Dauman, really one of the worst media CEOs of the last 20-plus years, I would say. Maybe, ever. He took what was one of the most vibrant and great businesses, in Viacom, drove it into the ground. He didn't understand Netflix, he didn't understand YouTube and rather than invest a bunch of money in streaming, which he should've done because they had the networks that were most exposed. MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, they speak to young people so you could see the trends early. I"", 'nstead of investing in streaming, he just bought back a bunch of stock. He did whatever he could to prop up the share price and it was really destructive to the enterprise long term. All the mistakes that Shari Redstone and Bob Bakish may or may not have made Philipe made more. Sumner Redstone, who was in charge of the company at the time and was the was the owner, they deserve the largest share of the blame, no question.', ""Ricky Mulvey: I wonder if there's an incentive problem right now. If Warner Brothers discovery and you've talked about it on the town, where David Zaslav has compensation award tied to the free cash flow of the business. I was talking to one of our investment analysts, Tim Buyers earlier. Basically, that's an uncommon way to incentivize a CEO. Feel free to break down this theory but now you have HBO or the company that's essentially shelved movies, one of which recently was the Wiley Coyote vs Acme movie. You get a tax loss on that, which is going to boost. You get the immediate boost of free cash flow but then, you might be killing ideas, drawing away creators."", ""Lucas Shaw: It's a question of whether he's incentivized to just cut cost to make cash flow look good and get himself paid more rather than act in the best interest of the company. It's a tough press. I don't think that David Zaslav made free cash and the Board made free cash flow the most important metric for his pay just because they knew that they were going to cut costs. I think they wanted to set the target. We have all this debt and we need to save money to pay it off. How are we going to incentivize people to do that? We're going to incentivize them to generate free cash flow and that's what they did."", ""That being said, it's just a terrible look for this guy who's about to get paid a ton of money, even though their stock is in the toilet, nobody thinks the company is performing very well. By the way, that free cash flow being the metric for performance and how people are paid, that doesn't apply to most of the employees of that company. It mostly applies to David Zaslav and maybe the inner circle. They're really perverse incentives there."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Listeners, you can catch Lucas Shaw on X. He is @Lucas_Shaw. Coming up after the break, Andy Cross and Matt Argersinger return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Dylan Lewis: As always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis joined again by Matt Argersinger and Andy Cross. If you went all in on the Stanley tumbler craze, you're going to have to make room in your cupboard for another weird household item that has caught fire. Andy, grocer Trader Joe's began selling mini tote bags for $3 in March. They are now selling for hundreds of dollars online. What are you make of this new consumer craze?"", ""Andy Cross: How many is many on the per square inch of tote bags? This has got to be a record if they're really small. We just bought a Stanley for $35 at REI and those things are some serious piece of hardware. We're now part of the Stanley craze, I think we have two of them now at the house so I can understand that. If it's me, when I go to Trader Joe's, I buy a lot of stuff. I'm bringing tote bags, hanging them on my shoulder, pulling them out of my jackets. Minis are not helping me very much."", 'Dylan Lewis: I think you timed the market well on that. I think you got in on the tumblers slightly after the peak and maybe have a good cost basis there. Matt, what do you make of these consumer phrases?', ""Matt Argersinger: I can't speak to this. I'm a guy who takes brown bags run reused bags to the grocery store and reuses them so I have I can't believe people are paying $100 for tote bags. I cannot believe it."", ""Dylan Lewis: I'm just happy people are using reusable bags. That makes me happy."", 'Andy Cross: There you go.', ""Dylan Lewis: I'll take that. Let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question. Matt, you're up first this week, what are you looking at?"", ""Matt Argersinger: Weird special situation here, Equity Commonwealth, the ticker is EQC. Equity Commonwealth, it's a two billion dollar real estate investment trust with 2.2 billion in net cash. Do the math there. Yes, it's trading below the cash on its balance sheet. Now it does own four office buildings that are cash-flowing but materially they're a very small part of the story here. Management is essentially sitting on 2.2 billion in cash collecting 5% with treasuries, which is good but waiting to make a transformative investment for the business."", ""The problem is they've been sitting on their hands for quite a while now. Investors are starting to get a little impatient and now there's a hedge fund called Land and Buildings Investment Management, LLC. That's a mouthful them but they own 3% of EQC shares, and they've submitted a letter demanding that EQC actually liquidate the business because under their model, liquidating the business would actually result in a net asset value of about 20% above where EQC is trading in the public markets. We'll have to see if this gets any traction. But I think it's a fastening situation to watch over the next few months."", ""Dylan Lewis: Dan, a special situation with Equity Commonwealth. What's your question?"", ""Dan Boyd: A special situation is called for, it doesn't make any dang sense. I'm sorry, are you trying to sell us on cash or office buildings, Mattie?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I think cash but it sounds like I'm actually trying to sell Dan a tote bag from Trader Joe's Andy, you're going to be able to beat that? What's on your radar?"", ""Andy Cross: I got Landstar guys, LSTR, an asset-light logistics company that generates more than five billion in sales, market cap value almost seven billion more cash than debt. It's an asset-light business, so it doesn't really own a lot of the assets. It uses technology to help clients, which is more than 25,000 customers across 1,100 independent agents. Basically get our goods from point A to point Z. Mostly inter-modal trucking, van shipments but also some Aaron Freight."", ""They help make sense of all the logistics challenges to be able to get all our stuff from when we buy it to when we want to consume it. Now it's been a tough two years post-pandemic because we're not buying as much stuff. Inventories are going lower. Companies are trying to run down all those inventories. You're just not seeing the volumes come across their net worth. That's been a big hit to their sales and to their profits. But this is a very talented management team. They focus very heavily on returns on capital and free cash flow. Ultimately in a pretty good spot, I think for Landstar."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Landstar.', 'Dan Boyd: First off, absolutely gorgeous stock chart here for the maximum time since they came out in 1993, whatever, just up until the right you love to see it But this is one of those companies where you read about it and you got to read four paragraphs to figure out the day. Make technology or make programming to help people do trucking. Not crazy about this company.', ""Andy Cross: But that's the magic behind Dan. Two tough businesses this week, Dan, which one's going on your watchlist?"", ""Dan Boyd: Well, I'm not going with whatever Mattie said Come on.

That massive growth spurt was driven by the expansion of its mobile, cloud, and AI ecosystems under Satya Nadella, who became the company's CEO in 2014."", ""Microsoft is still one of the market's top AI stocks, but investors are probably already looking for the next tech stock that could replicate those gains over the next decade. Could that company be Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), which is also gradually expanding its cloud and AI ecosystems but has a smaller market cap of $350 billion?"", 'Microsoft and Oracle operate different business models. Microsoft is a more diversified company and generates most of its revenue from its Windows operating system, Office productivity software, Azure cloud-based infrastructure platform, and other cloud-based services. It also sells ads in its Bing search engine, PC hardware through its Surface division, and video game products through its Xbox division.', ""Over the past decade, most of Microsoft's growth stemmed from Azure and the conversion of its Office products and Dynamics customer relationship management (CRM) platform into cloud-based services. Its investments in OpenAI also allowed it to integrate the start-up's generative AI tools into its own cloud-based ecosystem."", ""Oracle is one of the world's top database software companies. It initially established an early mover's advantage with its on-premise applications, but Amazon and Microsoft pulled ahead with their own cloud-based database services. To keep pace with that shift, Oracle transformed its on-premise applications to cloud-based services and inorganically expanded its ecosystem with more enterprise resource planning (ERP), CRM, and healthcare IT management services. It also launched its own cloud platform, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)."", ""Oracle now ranks third in the cloud-based database software market, behind Amazon and Microsoft, while OCI is still a tiny platform compared to Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. It also ranks third in the CRM market behind Salesforce and Microsoft, and it remains a distant underdog in the fragmented ERP market. That's probably why Oracle isn't often mentioned in the same breath as Microsoft or Amazon."", 'Oracle generated 38% of its revenue from its total cloud services in its latest quarter. By comparison, Microsoft generated 54% of its revenue from its cloud services last quarter.', 'Oracle plans to keep expanding its cloud business to offset the slower growth of its on-premise, licensing, and support divisions. It expects the rising usage of its back office database and ERP applications, the growth of OCI, and a new AI infrastructure contract with Nvidia to drive that expansion and widen its moat.', 'In its latest earnings report, CEO Safra Catz said Oracle expected to ""continue receiving large contracts reserving cloud infrastructure capacity because the demand for our Gen2 AI infrastructure substantially exceeds supply -- despite the fact we are opening new and expanding existing cloud datacenters very, very rapidly.""', 'In other words, Oracle should benefit from the expansion of the AI market, which Grand View Research expects to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% from 2023 to 2030. But a lot of those gains will still be offset by its slower-growing legacy businesses.', ""From fiscal 2023 (which ended last May) to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Oracle's revenue to increase at a CAGR of 8% as its EPS rises at a CAGR of 22%. A large portion of that earnings growth will likely be driven by big buybacks. It already bought back 38% of its shares over the past 10 years, and it should maintain that tradition for the foreseeable future."", ""Those growth rates are stable, but they probably won't turn Oracle into the next Microsoft. From fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last June), Microsoft grew its revenue at a CAGR of 11% as its EPS rose at a CAGR of 14%. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect its revenue and EPS to increase at a CAGR of 15% and 17%, respectively, as it continues to expand its cloud and AI ecosystems."", ""Assuming Oracle matches analysts' expectations for the next three years, continues to grow its EPS at a CAGR of 20% from fiscal 2026 to fiscal 2033, and trades at 20 times earnings, its stock could more than triple to $400 a share and lift its market cap to about $1.1 trillion. That would be an impressive 10-year gain, but it wouldn't match Microsoft's massive rally over the past decade. It would also still be a lot smaller than today's Microsoft."", ""So instead of wondering if Oracle will shake off its reputation as a dusty old tech stock and become the next Microsoft, investors should focus on its core strengths: it's successfully expanding its own cloud and AI businesses in the shadow of its larger competitors, it's returning plenty of cash to its shareholders, and its stock is still reasonably valued."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

It was a life-changing event for me.

It encouraged people to grow at the expense of others, which really challenged my value system. So, I decided to leave and look for a company that shared my values and focused on a culture of collaboration. That\'s how I found my way to Yum!""', 'Amy started with Yum!

Women tend to make decisions in their current career based on potential things that could happen in the future. For example, a woman might decide not to take a promotion because she might have a child next year. Meanwhile, she is not pregnant and, even if she is, why would a promotion conflict with that?

182,ab6e295a-5876-3f04-8304-ca84b73181d3,MCD,2024-03-30,Like McDonald's Stock? Why This Burger Rival Has More Upside for Investors,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ab6e295a-5876-3f04-8304-ca84b73181d3/like-mcdonald%27s-stock%3F-why.html,1711804980,STORY,"['SHAK', 'MCD']","[""When it comes to fast-food burger chains, the first name that likely comes to mind is McDonald's (NYSE: MCD). After all, the quick-serve restaurant operator has over 41,800 locations across the globe. Its golden arches are one of the most iconic logos in the world, and the company is a marketing machine."", ""However, McDonald's stock is not the best investment option in the quick-service hamburger space today -- that title belongs to Shake Shack (NYSE: SHAK). So why does this smaller rival have more potential upside? Well, one of the biggest reasons is its smaller size."", ""One of the biggest growth drivers for restaurant operators is adding new locations, and Shake Shack just has more opportunities to increase its numbers on a percentage basis than a company the size of McDonald's."", ""Why is this important? Because stocks tend to be valued in part on companies' potential for growth, and adding new restaurants increases both sales and profits. Each Shake Shack averages close to $4 million in sales at a restaurant-level operating margin of about 20%, which means each individual company-owned restaurant generates a profit of approximately $800,000 before any corporate-level costs."", ""With 518 total locations -- 334 of them in the U.S. -- as of the end of 2023, Shake Shack has a lot of room to add new restaurants. While it is unlikely to ever get close to the size of McDonald's, it should be able to get to at least a similar size to Five Guys, which has nearly 1,500 locations in the U.S. and sells premium burgers similar to those at Shake Shake. Combined with international opportunities, the company should be able to quadruple its number of locations from here. That is something McDonald's is unlikely to be able to do, given its size."", 'Shake Shack plans to add 40 company-owned locations this year and 40 licensed locations. The company-owned ones will primarily be in domestic markets where it already has a presence, while the licensed locations will be in new and existing international markets, as well as domestic airports and rest stops.', ""Shake Shack also has a nice opportunity to improve its results by following some initiatives that McDonald's has already implemented. One such area is drive-thrus, which McDonald's has been using since the 1970s. Shake Shake has been testing drive-thrus at about 30 locations. The big benefit of drive-thrus is that they speed up the ordering process, which allows restaurants to serve more customers, and thus generate more sales."", ""In a similar vein, Shake Shack is starting to roll out ordering kiosks -- a technological innovation that also has benefited McDonald's. Kiosks reduce both ordering times and labor costs. Consumers also tend to spend more per visit when ordering from kiosks. Shake Shack said it has been seeing a high single-digit percentage increase in check sizes for kiosk orders versus those placed with traditional cashiers."", 'Over the past couple of years, restaurant operators have benefited from being able to increase prices due to high inflation, often in excess of the increased costs they faced. This has helped push same-store sales higher while boosting profits. The reason profits go up despite inflationary pressure is quite simple. The price increases help restaurants keep their margins, which leads to higher profits.', 'Even if margins slip a bit, though, profits can still go up. For example, a 20% margin on $85 million in sales is $17 million in operating profit, while an 18% margin on $100 million in sales is $18 million. So if the top line grows by a large enough percentage, profits can rise even if margins shrink, but companies generally try to keep their margins steady or increase them. Not surprisingly, the restaurant industry has enjoyed some good results in this environment.', ""Now that inflation has moderated considerably, further price increases for both restaurant operators are likely to be smaller than they were in recent years. Shake Shake says it's looking to increase prices by 2.5% this year, and McDonald's is talking about low single-digit percentage increases. Both are also expecting to drive traffic growth this year. So while the environment isn't quite as strong as it was in years past, both companies look well-positioned to continue to drive sales growth."", ""Both McDonald's and Shake Shake should be solid long-term performers. However, Shake Shake has more upside potential given its capacity to add more locations and improve its operating efficiency through initiatives such as drive-thrus and kiosks."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Shake Shack right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Shake Shack, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Shake Shack wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our coverage of the global food industry and recent events, then you can check out 5 Biggest Food Companies in the World by Revenue. ', 'Just like the oil industry, the food industry is another sector that is quite crucial to global economic well being. Over the course of time, advances in transportation have ensured that the global food industry is an intermix of products shipped all over the world, a fact that makes it quite vulnerable as the world witnessed in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Since both countries are key global suppliers of commodities such as grain and wheat, their conflict made food prices surge all over as investors worried about supply chain shocks.', 'Similarly, advances in production and agriculture technology also mean that as countries such as India are able to utilize their natural advances for mass producing commodities such as sugar and rice, they are also able to influence global food prices as was evident last year in the rice industry after India banned its rice exports. For more details about the rice industry, you can check out Top 20 Rice Producing Countries In The World.', 'Since then, the global food industry and food prices have somewhat stabilized particularly after record interest rate hiking sprees by central banks. As opposed to high growth stock market sectors such as technology, food companies and food company stocks are more stable and do not entice investors who are chasing lucrative share price appreciations Their stability comes from the fact that food company stocks benefit from stable demand for their products even during an economic downturn. As a whole, these stocks are dubbed as consumer staples and you can find out more about them by reading 14 Best Consumer Staples Stocks To Buy Now.', 'Building on this, 2023 and 2024 have been marked by a renewed investor focus on technology stocks, with artificial intelligence companies such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in particular attracting billions of dollars in capital. At the same time, this continuing popularity and utility of technology has also continued to affect the global food industry. For instance, the food industry is known for controversial products such as palm oil and the impact they have on global greenhouse gas emissions. On this front, a British startup focusing on manufacturing oils and fat sustainably scored a win in March 2024 when it secured €2.9 million in investments.', ""One particular area of the food industry that has been creating quite a bit of buzz these days is the cocoa industry. One of the hottest food raw materials over the past couple of years has been cocoa. Cocoa is used to make chocolate, and recent price movements in this commodity have meant that investing in cocoa might have been better for those fortunate to have done so than buying NVIDIA's shares before the start of the late 2022 - early 2023 AI wave on Wall Street. May cocoa futures crossed a whopping $10,000 per ton in March 2024, to mark a whopping 246% gain over the past twelve months. The reason cocoa prices are high is because there are supply disruptions in the production hub of Africa, with multiple analysts expecting that global cocoa supply will shrink over the next year or so."", 'So, as the food industry continues to be quite dynamic despite being a stable sector, we decided to look at the biggest food companies in the world.

REITs empower anyone to invest in wealth-creating, income-producing real estate.', ""They've certainly done that over the years. Over the long term, our research found that REITs have outperformed stocks. Since 1994, three REIT subgroups stood out for their ability to beat the S&P 500. Here's a closer look at these market-beating REIT types. "", ""According to data from Nareit, self-storage REITs have delivered a 17.3% average annual total return since 1994. That has obliterated the S&P 500's 10.1% average annual total return during that period."", 'Self-storage REITs have routinely delivered strong returns compared to other REITs:', 'As that slide highlights, the group has delivered the No. 1 cumulative-sector return since 1999. The space has delivered strong returns over the past decade:', ' EXR Total Return Level data by YCharts.', 'Extra Space Storage (NYSE: EXR) has led the way. As of the final day of 2023, it was the second-best performing REIT over the past decade, with a 443% total return. ', ""A few factors have driven the sector's strong returns. Self-storage properties are very profitable, requiring an occupancy level of 40% to 45% to break even (compared to 60% for most multifamily properties). Meanwhile, demand is steadily rising and relatively economically resilient. On top of that, self-storage leases are short term, which enables operators to increase rents to market rates reasonably quickly. These catalysts have enabled the top-three remaining publicly traded self-storage REITs to grow their core funds from operations (FFO) per share by more than 200% apiece since 2011, with Extra Space growing by nearly 690%. That has enabled all three to deliver robust dividend growth. The rapidly rising dividend income and earnings have enabled these REITs to handily beat the S&P 500. "", 'Industrial REITs have delivered the second-best performance in the sector since 1994, with an average annual total return of 14.4%. They have also delivered strong performance over the past decade, with Rexford Industrial and Prologis (NYSE: PLD) delivering two of the five highest returns among REITs at 440.8% and 379%, respectively, as of the end of last year. ', ""Two factors have helped drive the performance of industrial REITs: The accelerating adoption of e-commerce and changing supply chain practices. They've enabled industrial REITs focused on logistics properties to deliver strong core FFO and dividend growth. Over the last five years, logistics REITs have grown their core FFO per share by 9% annually (with 12% from industry-leader Prologis) while delivering 10% compound annual dividend growth (and 12% from Prologis). "", ""The sector expects to continue growing rapidly. Rents on existing warehouse properties are skyrocketing due to high demand and low vacancy levels. That's enabling REITs to develop additional properties. These catalysts drive Prologis' view that it can grow its core FFO per share by 9% to 11% annually through 2026. That should also enable the company to continue increasing its dividend at a strong rate. Those two drivers could enable the leading industrial REIT to maintain its market-beating performance. "", ""Residential REITs have delivered the third-highest performance among REIT subgroups since 1994 at 12.7% annually. A few factors have helped drive the sector's strong performance. They include relatively economically resilient demand for rental homes (people need a place to live), enabling landlords to steadily increase rents. Housing market imbalances, especially since the Financial Crisis, have also helped drive demand for rental housing. "", 'As an investment, manufactured home communities have stood out. Equity LifeStyle (NYSE: ELS) was the fourth-best performing REIT over the past decade, delivering a nearly 400% total return as of the end of last year. A big driver is the economic resiliency of manufactured-home communities. These landlords can continue raising rents during a recession because the costs of moving a manufactured home to another community are often too prohibitive. ', 'That driver has enabled Equity LifeStyle to grow its same-store net-operating income at a 4.3% annual rate since 1998, faster than the REIT sector average and apartments (both at 3.3%). Add in an ever-expanding portfolio (which also includes RV parks and marinas), and the company has grown its normalized FFO per share at an 8.6% compound annual rate since 2006. That has allowed it to deliver 21% compound annual dividend growth during that period. ', ""REITs have outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term. A big driver has been the robust returns from self-storage, industrial, and residential REITs. The factors that have enabled those REIT subgroups to deliver strong returns remain in place. That's why investors should consider adding one or more of those REIT classes to their portfolio."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Prologis right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Prologis, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Prologis wasn’t one of them.

At the same time, the high barriers of entry mean that not only are the top industrial machinery stocks among some of the most advanced companies in the world but also that these firms enjoy the comfort of economies of scale that are hard to compete with.', 'As an example, consider some of the most valuable industrial machinery stocks in terms of market capitalization. A couple of such firms are General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW), and Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN). General Electric, makes and sells some of the most advanced machines in the world. These include jet engines which are the backbone of the U.S. Air Force and nuclear reactors. These reactors are some of the most exacting engineered products on the planet due to the high stress environment in which they operate and the extreme catastrophe that awaits them should even the slightest thing go awry.', 'Similarly, Eaton plays an integral role in the global aviation supply chain. An average jet engine for a commercial airliner can contain as many as fifty thousand individual components, from high precision crystal fan blades to pipes, pumps, and hydraulic motors. All of these have to be kept in prime condition, and they are built to a standard that not many firms can achieve.', 'However, unlike high growth technology stocks, industrial machinery stocks are more down to Earth. Like their technology peers, their performance depends on interest rates since funding pricey manufacturing plants and other equipment requires loans. Similarly, the rosier the economic outlook is, the better industrial machinery stocks fare on the stock market since the demand for their products is assumed to be stable.', 'As an illustration of this aspect of industrial machinery stock performance, consider the shares of General Electric and Eaton. They bled as much as 51% of their share price value on the stock market after the coronavirus lockdowns were put into place, as investor outlook for the global economy darkened.', 'But what about recent stock performance? After all, investor expectations of an easing in interest rates could also generate tailwinds for industrial machinery stocks. 2024 has seen investors start off the year on an optimistic note for rate cuts, but settle with the knowledge that the Fed might take longer than they would like. Year to date, both GE and Eaton are up by 39% and 31%, respectively, with GE enjoying slightly higher returns in the wake of its announcement that it will split into two companies.', ""Analyzing industrial machinery stocks means that investors have to focus on their product portfolio and the potential to both reduce costs (often dubbed as 'improving margins') and gain market share. Both these themes were also present during the latest full hedge fund investor letter cycle which was for the fourth quarter of 2023."", 'For instance, Southeastern Asset Management mentioned General Electric in its investor letter for the period as it outlined:', 'General Electric - Industrial conglomerate General Electric (GE) was the top performer for the year. We exited this multi-year investment as its price went above our appraisal. In 1Q23, GE spun out GE Healthcare, which we sold as it traded at our value. The share price continued its strong performance throughout the spring and summer, and we ultimately sold the position in the third quarter when we no longer saw a margin of safety for the business. CEO Larry Culp was a great partner who created significant value for shareholders by reducing leverage, cutting costs, streamlining operations, improving company culture and simplifying the structure with plans to split the company into three businesses. We hope to have the opportunity to partner with him again in the future.', 'Artisan Partners was more detailed in its coverage of Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) when it shared:', 'Xylem is a global leader in water technology across pumps, smart meters and treatment services. More than 80% of the company’s sales come from markets where it maintains the No. 1 or No. 2 market position. Xylem’s pumps business (selling primarily to utilities) is a sticky and profitable operation that provides capital to invest in more innovative solutions, such as smart meters. In mid-2023, Xylem completed the acquisition of Evoqua, giving it a leading position in the US water treatment business. We believe the company is at the start of a compelling profit cycle. Smart meter sales are recovering from supply chain issues, cost and revenue synergies from the acquisition are in the early innings, and a newly hired (and well- respected) CFO should help catalyze long-awaited margin expansion. Meanwhile, rising demand for solutions to water sustainability challenges should persist as a strong trend for years to come.', 'Seems like smart money is, like always, aware of broader trends that could be helping industrial machinery stocks set themselves up for years of growth. Consequently, we decided to take a look at some such stocks and the notable names were Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH).', 'A factory floor filled with specialized drug manufacturing machinery and workers.', 'Our Methodology', 'To make our list of the best industrial machinery stocks, we ranked the most valuable specialty industrial machinery and heavy machinery stocks by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023 and picked out the top stocks.', 'For these best industrial machinery stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

But many stable, dividend-paying companies have largely missed out on the growth-fueled rally.', 'United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) have lost value over that time, while Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI) is up less than 8%. The rationale for investing in these dividend stocks is to generate stable passive income no matter what the market is doing, not trying to outperform the S&P 500 over a short period of time.', ""Here's why these Motley Fool contributors think all three dividend stocks have what it takes to continue raising their payouts and rewarding shareholders."", 'Scott Levine (UPS): Providing the market with 2026 financial targets, UPS suggested to investors this week that it sees growth over the next three years -- a period during which the company expects to ""drive higher productivity and efficiency,"" according to its CEO, Carol Tome. However, investors didn\'t take kindly to the news as Tome also stated that UPS is battling near-term headwinds.', ""However, this shouldn't preclude forward-looking investors from picking up shares. Although they should rightly be mindful of how the company handles the current challenges, UPS is a leading supply chain company that has overcome challenges before, making it -- and its forward-yielding 4.5% dividend -- a smart pick right now."", 'One of the ways that UPS will achieve productivity and efficiency increases is through its embracing of artificial intelligence. In 2023, for example, UPS opened a new facility where AI and machine learning have taken center stage. Dubbed UPS Velocity, the Kentucky-based warehouse has more than 700 mobile robots in operation, and UPS expects to increase this to 3,000 by the end of the year. Powered by AI and machine learning, the mobile robots and human employees currently move more than 350,000 packages through the 900,000 square-foot facility.', 'It\'s not only in warehouses where UPS is leveraging the power of AI. The company has relied on AI since 2012 for optimizing delivery routes. According to UPS,\xa0Orion ""recalculates individual package delivery routes throughout the day as traffic conditions, pickup commitments, and delivery orders change."" By optimizing routes based on changing conditions, UPS can reduce both the number of miles that drivers travel and the amount of fuel that the vehicles must use -- two factors that help the company to reduce costs. From 2012 through 2020, UPS estimated that Orion had helped the company to achieve annual savings of approximately 100 million miles and 10 million gallons of fuel.', ""Lee Samaha (Chevron): Warren Buffett bought Chevron stock this year even though the stock price was disappointing. The stock is slightly down over the last year, compared to the S&P 500's 31% rise, and the price of oil is still above $80 a barrel."", ""One reason, which also explains why it's underperformed peers like ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, and Occidental Petroleum so far this year, is the uncertainty around its intended $60 billion acquisition of Hess. Oil majors have been looking to acquire energy assets as they generate bundles of cash from a relatively high price of oil. Meanwhile, the sector continues to fall out of favor among investors due to concerns about investing in fossil fuels as the world transitions to clean energy solutions."", ""That said, there's still a hugely important role for oil in the global economy, and there's upward pressure on the price given OPEC and OPEC+ production cuts. Whoever wins the next election is going to have to replenish the massive drawdown in the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve carried out by the current administration in an attempt to lower gasoline prices."", 'In addition, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has already raised its oil-demand estimate four times since November.', ""If the oil bulls and Warren Buffett are correct, then Chevron, with or without Hess, is likely to generate bundles of cash flow in the future, and that's excellent news for income-seeking investors."", ""Daniel Foelber (Kinder Morgan): When the market is roaring higher, it's easy to overlook quality pipeline and energy-infrastructure stocks like Kinder Morgan. After all, the growth prospects are limited."", ""Existing infrastructure could lose value if oil and natural gas demand falls over the next few decades. But that's not the case right now. In fact, the world needs more energy."", 'Kinder Morgan is investing in infrastructure to support the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG). LNG is natural gas that has been cooled and condensed into liquid form for easier transport overseas.', ""Kinder Morgan's projects require high up-front costs but produce stable cash flows thanks to long-term contracts. Kinder Morgan's business is ideally suited as a low-growth company that returns cash to shareholders."", 'After cutting its dividend to $0.125 a share after the 2015 oil and gas crash, Kinder Morgan has since raised its dividend back up to $0.2825 -- presenting a yield of 6.3%. Kinder Morgan has consistently raised its dividend every year since 2018, and there will probably be another moderate raise in the next quarter or two.', ""Kinder Morgan has done an impressive job restoring order to its balance sheet by paying down debt. To sustain a healthy balance sheet, Kinder Morgan must support the dividend with free cash flow so it doesn't have to deplete its cash position or take on debt. Two useful metrics to compare are its FCF yield and its dividend yield."", ""As you can see in the chart, Kinder Morgan's FCF yield is higher than its dividend yield. FCF yield is just FCF per share divided by the share price. But more importantly, it tells us how much the dividend could be if Kinder Morgan paid out all of its FCF. The four percentage point or so difference between the FCF yield and the dividend yield gives Kinder Morgan a nice margin for error. It indicates its dividend is affordable and there is room to raise the dividend in the future."", ""All told, Kinder Morgan is worth considering if you're looking for an investment centered around passive income rather than potential capital gains."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in United Parcel Service right now?', 'Before you buy stock in United Parcel Service, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and United Parcel Service wasn’t one of them.

We'll use ROE to examine United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), by way of a worked example."", ""Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments."", ' Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Parcel Service is:', '39% = US$6.7b ÷ US$17b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.39."", ""Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, United Parcel Service has a superior ROE than the average (11%) in the Logistics industry."", ""That is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .  Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for United Parcel Service."", 'Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.', ""United Parcel Service does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.26. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it."", 'Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.', ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

They agreed to settle a lawsuit with merchants, almost 20 years in the making, to lower their swipe fees, the amount they charge merchants for processing credit and debit card transactions. Let's go through the details to see how it could affect investors."", ""Visa and Mastercard agreed to lower all of their swipe fees (or interchange rates) by 0.04 percentage point for three years and lower the average rate by 0.07 percentage point for the next five years. The merchants' legal team said this would save their clients $30 billion over that time. Visa and Mastercard together generated about $58 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months, and losing those fees could make a substantial dent in sales."", ""Another part of the settlement allows merchants to help shoppers choose the best or cheapest payment option, getting around previous requirements that merchants had to follow to be able to accept Visa and Mastercard. For example, participating merchants are currently required to honor all cards of each network and can't choose to accept certain ones that could end up being cheaper for the merchant."", ""This isn't the end of the story. Merchants are still worried about the five-year cap, after which the credit card companies can go back to raising rates."", ""A federal judge denied Visa's and Mastercard's request to finish the litigation here, allowing further cases against them. Several large retailers, including Target, Foot Locker, and Starbucks, say that Visa and Mastercard collude to keep processing rates high, and the retailers are pursuing a separate case against them."", ""This comes following the news that Capital One is acquiring Discover, the fourth-largest credit card network after Visa, Mastercard, and American Express. Although regulators are concerned about how that could reduce competition, it could also break down Visa's and Mastercard's duopoly and generate more competition."", 'Visa and Mastercard enjoy dominant, high-margin businesses that generate rising revenue and increasing profit as shoppers spend more money. This is precisely why investors love these businesses, and Visa and Mastercard stocks have both created tremendous shareholder value. These are the kinds of qualities Warren Buffett looks for in a great stock, and his Berkshire Hathaway owns shares of American Express, Visa, Mastercard, and Capital One.', 'Neither Visa nor Mastercard gave any insight into how the settlement might affect their performance over the next few years. That might be coming in their next quarterly reports.', ""Both of these companies are likely to be able to absorb the impact of the settlement, but if it indeed saves merchants $30 billion over five years, that works out to $3 billion per year for each company, which is substantial. None of this changes the networks' model, but it could reset the revenue level lower than it is today and lead to slower growth."", 'Visa and Mastercard have other revenue streams outside of interchange fees, including small-business solutions. But the bulk of their business is interchange fees.', 'Some experts predict that the five years of temporary relief for merchants give time for market forces to transform the current payment system in the U.S., and that after the five years are over, the landscape could look completely different.', ""Investors shouldn't be worried -- yet.

As such, the relationship with American Express has turned into a significant income generator for Delta, as remuneration from American Express has grown significantly."", 'Management sees it hitting $10 billion over the long term.', ""The three points come together to create Delta's secret weapon. If wealth inequality increases, more spending will likely be concentrated in the higher percentile of income earners. That's good news for companies that have captured customers in those higher income brackets, and that's arguably what Delta's SkyMiles program has done."", 'On Investor Day last June, management said it had 25 million active members of the SkyMiles program, 30% of whom had a co-branded credit card.', 'Delta\'s senior vice president of Customer Engagement & Loyalty, Dwight James, noted, ""Our portfolio is becoming more and more premium. The more premium my portfolio, the higher the average spend and the higher the remuneration from American Express."" Moreover, Delta is driving SkyMiles\' adoption among ""younger, more engaged, and more premium"" customers by offering free Wi-Fi and partnerships with companies like Starbucks.', 'That resulted in a lowering of the average age of new members from 44 in 2017 to 39 in 2022 and a shift in premium revenue from SkyMiles from 15% in 2017 to 29% in 2022.', 'In short, Delta is winning younger, more affluent SkyMiles members, resulting in a shift in revenue from the (fast-growing) program to the higher-margin premium services.', ""Aside from the headline risk of a slowdown in the economy and air travel, Delta could face risks from increased regulation in the credit card industry.

You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Countries Offering Citizenship by Investment in 2024. ', 'In the contemporary world, the need for monetary as well as physical safety and security has created a surge for international mobility. Given the relaxation witnessed in immigration laws as well as a greater focus on governments to encourage foreign direct investment and attract foreign talent, citizenship by investment programs have taken a higher prominence. It has been estimated that about 5000 individuals, annually, are granted citizenship by investment. The year 2022, saw 1,375 citizenship by investment applications submitted in the three Caribbean Islands -- Antigua & Barbuda, Saint Lucia, and Grenada -- which are also among the most popular destinations under these programs.', 'Citizenship by investment programs are designed to fast-track the naturalization process in return for a substantial amount of investment in various avenues consisting of property, bonds, funds, bank deposits, businesses and donations etc. For high-net-worth-individuals (HNWIs) especially, the allure of citizenship programs is manifold. While in some cases they might be motivated to gravitate towards nations that offer a higher quality education and healthcare, safety, and in short a higher quality of life, in others the reason could be the tax law differential across countries. Tax havens with citizenship by investment programs are favorites for wealthy individuals seeking to maximize their incomes. In 2018 about 108,000 HNWIs migrated and the 2024 projected-figure stands at 128,000.', 'Apart from HNWIs, the benefit of tax-friendly countries offering citizenship programs can be enjoyed by other people as well, especially in cases where the investment is not too high. The American expats, for instance, have to pay taxes on income generated from anywhere around the world, even when they are not living in the country. A latest survey on American expats revealed that about 1 in 3 American expatriates either plan on renouncing their citizenship or are “seriously considering” to do so. The reason behind the inclination was found to be tax filing and their management. In fact, in 2020 a record high of 6,705 Americans actually gave up their citizenship, although the number did drop to 2,426 in 2022.', 'While investors can indeed benefit from citizenship by investment schemes, the countries offering them stand to gain much as well. Vanuatu recorded $40.5 million from citizenship-by-investment programs from January 2022 to June 2022, while the European Parliament Research Service reported earnings of 9.2 billion euros from 2008 to 2018 through investment programs. Citizenship and residence by investment programs can have varying impacts on the GDP of the host country, ranging between 2% and 30%.', 'Financial companies with global presence can become extremely useful for people planning on investing and setting up finances in another country. In this field, firms like JP Morgan Chase and Co. (NYSE:JPM) as well as American Express Co. (NASDAQ: AXP) are two names that spring to mind.', 'JP Morgan Chase and Co.

In the fourth quarter, we continued to drive strong customer engagement and demand for our premium products. We had solid growth in billings, strong new account acquisitions, and continued strength in credit quality, which remains the best in the industry. As a result, we achieved fourth quarter revenues of nearly $16 billion, which was another quarterly record, and EPS was $2.62.

The aim of the program is to ensure that the investment contributes towards uplifting the Austrian economy through actively investing in either a joint venture or a direct investment in a job or a new business that would create export sales. However, on a note of caution, other than for specific cases, Austria does not recognize dual citizenship.', 'Insider Monkey Tax Friendliness Score: 11', 'Strategically placed and connected with large markets around it, Turkey stands out as a very beneficial place for investors.

The citizenship can be attained in 3-6 months.', 'Insider Monkey Tax Friendliness Score: 10', 'Not only is Malta’s residency program a popular choice for investors, its citizenship by investment plan -- known as Malta Exceptional Investor Naturalization (MEIN) Policy -- has also enticed many people looking for a second home. Among its various benefits, the applicant can include family members including spouse, children, parents, and grandparents. Under this plan, there are two options for the investor and the lowest cost pertains to a contribution to a National Development and Social Fund of €600,000, granting citizenship in about 36 months. €50,000 is charged for every additional family member. The applicant also must make a donation and purchase or lease a property in the country. The higher investment of €750,000 grants citizenship in 12 months.', 'Insider Monkey Tax Friendliness Score: 9', 'Jordan sports a highly business conducive environment and is a great option for investors wishful for not only expanding their business but also in gaining a second citizenship. A stable country in the Middle-East, its passport can allow visa-free travel to more than 50 countries. Furthermore, the application includes immediate family members in which spouse, children under 18, widowed or divorced daughters as well as parents can qualify. There are three available options, ranging from $1.5 million to $1 million to the lowest amount of $750,000 in a productive economic sector project located outside of Amman that provides at least 10 jobs for Jordanians. The citizenship is generally awarded in about 3-6 months.', 'Insider Monkey Tax Friendliness Score: 9', 'Saint Lucia offers a comparatively low cost citizenship by investment program. For a single applicant the minimum cost amounts to US $100,000 investment in the country’s National Economic Fund, and this price increases with addition of family members in the application. Family members can include a spouse, children under 31, siblings under 18, and parents aged 55 and over. Dependents can also be added on after the citizenship is awarded. The attractiveness of greater international mobility encompassing visa-free travel to more than 140 countries is yet another plus point of the program.', 'Insider Monkey Tax Friendliness Score: 8', 'Another Caribbean country offering citizenship by investment program in 2024, Grenada can provide investors with multifarious benefits. The country has an E-2 Investor Visa Treaty with the US according to which Grenada citizens that haven been domiciled in the country for three years, can become eligible to apply for the non-immigrant visa. Additionally, the passport granted after citizenship of the country can open up visa hassle free travel to more than 140 countries.', 'Furthermore, the investor is allowed to include spouse, children below 30, unmarried siblings from 18 and over, parents, and grandparents of the main applicant as well as that of the spouse. The citizenship is also transferable to new spouses and future generations. A minimum investment in the form of a donation to the National Transformation Fund of US $150,000 for a single applicant is the minimum cost and the application is usually processed in 3-6 months.', 'Insider Monkey Tax Friendliness Score: 7', 'In order to attract foreign direct investment, the Egyptian government launched the citizenship by investment program in 2020. Strategically placed the country offers access to Africa, Europe, Indian subcontinent, and the Middle-East.

If you want to skip our coverage of the global food industry and recent events, then you can check out 5 Biggest Food Companies in the World by Revenue. ', 'Just like the oil industry, the food industry is another sector that is quite crucial to global economic well being. Over the course of time, advances in transportation have ensured that the global food industry is an intermix of products shipped all over the world, a fact that makes it quite vulnerable as the world witnessed in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Since both countries are key global suppliers of commodities such as grain and wheat, their conflict made food prices surge all over as investors worried about supply chain shocks.', 'Similarly, advances in production and agriculture technology also mean that as countries such as India are able to utilize their natural advances for mass producing commodities such as sugar and rice, they are also able to influence global food prices as was evident last year in the rice industry after India banned its rice exports. For more details about the rice industry, you can check out Top 20 Rice Producing Countries In The World.', 'Since then, the global food industry and food prices have somewhat stabilized particularly after record interest rate hiking sprees by central banks. As opposed to high growth stock market sectors such as technology, food companies and food company stocks are more stable and do not entice investors who are chasing lucrative share price appreciations Their stability comes from the fact that food company stocks benefit from stable demand for their products even during an economic downturn. As a whole, these stocks are dubbed as consumer staples and you can find out more about them by reading 14 Best Consumer Staples Stocks To Buy Now.', 'Building on this, 2023 and 2024 have been marked by a renewed investor focus on technology stocks, with artificial intelligence companies such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in particular attracting billions of dollars in capital. At the same time, this continuing popularity and utility of technology has also continued to affect the global food industry. For instance, the food industry is known for controversial products such as palm oil and the impact they have on global greenhouse gas emissions. On this front, a British startup focusing on manufacturing oils and fat sustainably scored a win in March 2024 when it secured €2.9 million in investments.', ""One particular area of the food industry that has been creating quite a bit of buzz these days is the cocoa industry. One of the hottest food raw materials over the past couple of years has been cocoa. Cocoa is used to make chocolate, and recent price movements in this commodity have meant that investing in cocoa might have been better for those fortunate to have done so than buying NVIDIA's shares before the start of the late 2022 - early 2023 AI wave on Wall Street. May cocoa futures crossed a whopping $10,000 per ton in March 2024, to mark a whopping 246% gain over the past twelve months. The reason cocoa prices are high is because there are supply disruptions in the production hub of Africa, with multiple analysts expecting that global cocoa supply will shrink over the next year or so."", 'So, as the food industry continues to be quite dynamic despite being a stable sector, we decided to look at the biggest food companies in the world.

The retail spaces will be set up to run smoothly and will guarantee a hassle-free shopping experience. Additionally, traditional brick-and-mortar stores are transforming into engaging places that offer immersive experiences and much more than the typical shopping trip to captivate customers' senses. Abercrombie & Fitch Co.’s (NYSE:ANF) CEO, Fran Horowitz said:"", '“The future of retail is small, efficient, omni stores, and they’re located where the customer tells us. [For Abercrombie] these big, massive stores were just not productive and not efficient — the consumer was responding to a much more intimate associate experience, and then economically, they were not productive. You don’t get the kind of traffic through the stores like you did in the past when there wasn’t a digital option, so you have to provide a location that is financially sound, which has X amount of traffic and X amount of digital orders that come together.”', 'Additionally, the executives emphasized the role of AI in the future of retail. They said that AI will reshape retail through personalized experiences owing to data analysis. Advanced algorithms will deliver tailored recommendations and promotions and that will improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. Additionally, AI will help with the seamless integration of online and offline channels, which will make transitions for shoppers much easier. This can enhance convenience and flexibility and encourage customers to engage with retailers across various platforms. As CEO of Levi Strauss & Co.

But I think where the technology is going to go is it’s going to be able to leap into something like, to go from you’re a 501 shopper to this is going to be the perfect denim skirt for you and make bolder leaps, but do it in a way that’s informed based on your shopping history and who you are.”', 'The executives also stated that sustainability and inclusivity are some of the top priorities in retail, with a focus on inclusive sizing and sustainable practices like using eco-friendly materials and ethical sourcing. Sam’s Club CEO Chris Nicholas mentioned that renewable energy and electric vehicles are going to become vastly important in the future of retail. On December 13, Walmart Canada announced putting Canada’s first electric semi-trucks on the road. According to the company, each of the trucks will travel around 68,000 miles annually.

Dollar General, a discount retail chain in the US, has dealt with a few struggles. The retailer had previously benefited from COVID stimulus checks, reflected in the bump it experienced in revenues and margins. However, the effects have worn off, and its core consumer has been hurt by inflation, stiffer economic conditions, lower tax refunds and reduced SNAP benefits. Margins are also under pressure due to labor costs, shrink and markdowns. Some of the issues are likely self-inflicted. After years of focusing on store growth to drive the top line, store standards have suffered. Addressing store standards is needed to turn around flagging traffic, comps and customer satisfaction. On the positive side, discount retail due to its trade-down feature tends to be a defensive business during economic slowdowns. Dollar General has a strong market position and faces less competition than other discounters due to its largely rural footprint. The business’s value proposition is everyday low prices, a convenient format and proximity. The company has leverage due to capital expenditures, but interest coverage of ~9X is strong. From a valuation perspective, the froth from the pandemic, when it traded in the low- to mid-twenties, is gone. So, we aren’t paying for margin upside or store growth. Those would be bonuses.

Some stocks have it. Others don\'t. But when you find stocks with the ""it factor,"" you\'ll want to load up on them.', ""Three Motley Fool contributors believe they've identified three stocks that fit the bill. Here's why they think CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP), Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) are unstoppable stocks to buy hand over fist in April."", ""Prosper Junior Bakiny (CRISPR Therapeutics): If one were to make a list of prominent biotech companies, CRISPR Therapeutics almost certainly wouldn't make the cut. The gene editing specialist has just one product on the shelves and a market cap of $5.6 billion. However, considering the company's progress in the past few years, CRISPR Therapeutics appears to have substantial upside potential."", ""CRISPR Therapeutics created Casgevy, a gene editing treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT) that has been landing approvals in various countries since late last year. Management shrewdly partnered with a biotech giant, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, to develop and market this therapy. Though this means CRISPR Therapeutics will only get 40% of the profits associated with Casgevy, thanks to the partnership it has been able to earn regulatory nods in places it likely wouldn't have pursued -- or would have done it much later."", ""Smaller biotechs tend to focus almost exclusively on the more lucrative U.S. market. Casgevy is approved in the U.S., Great Britain, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain. Casgevy is also the first CRISPR-based gene editing therapy on the market. The pioneers of this technique won a Nobel Prize in chemistry. CRISPR Therapeutics' pipeline boasts several other gene editing programs."", 'CRISPR Therapeutics has been riding solid momentum over the past year. Expect the company to continue delivering solid returns for a long time.', ""David Jagielski (Eli Lilly): One stock that looks unstoppable these days is Eli Lilly. Although its share price has soared 130% in just the past 12 months, there's still plenty more upside for the stock in the long haul. Given the growth opportunities on the horizon, I wouldn't be surprised for the stock to join the $1 trillion club before the end of the year."", 'The name of the game in the healthcare industry these days is weight loss. Companies are feverishly working away to get a drug to market in what is shaping up to potentially be a big battle down the road.', ""The early favorite that won't be easy to beat is Eli Lilly's Zepbound. If you haven't heard its name nearly as much as you've heard Ozempic, that's because it was only approved last year. But in clinical trials, the drug's potential has been nothing short of impressive."", ""With tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound and Mounjaro (approved for diabetes), patients were able to lose nearly 27% of their body weight when making lifestyle changes and taking the drug. And that's just the average weight loss over an 84-week period; some patients lost even more weight."", ""With peak sales of more than $68 billion (according to analysts) coming from these drugs in the future, it's hard to cap the potential for Eli Lilly. Throw into the mix the potential approval of its early Alzheimer's treatment, donanemab, and in a few years you may regret not buying the stock at its current price. While its earnings multiple of 133 looks obscene right now, given the earnings growth Eli Lilly may generate in the future, it could still prove to be a cheap buy today."", 'Keith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): Success in treating cystic fibrosis (CF) has helped Vertex Pharmaceuticals become a huge biotech. I expect it will grow much bigger over the next few years.', ""CF should provide some of this anticipated growth. Vertex enjoys a monopoly in treating the underlying cause of the rare genetic disorder. The company plans to file for approvals of its vanzacaftor triple-drug combo this summer. I predict that this drug will become Vertex's biggest CF moneymaker yet."", ""As Prosper noted above, Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics have a potential winner on their hands with Casgevy in treating SCD and TDT. The gene editing therapy is Vertex's first major victory outside CF, but I don't think it will be the biotech's last."", ""Vertex has high hopes for its pain drug VX-548. The company is on track to file for U.S. approval in mid-2024. Because VX-548 doesn't have the addictive qualities and negative side effects associated with opioids, it could have tremendous commercial potential."", ""I'm optimistic about another of Vertex's late-stage programs, too. Inaxaplin targets APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD). There are currently no approved therapies that treat the underlying cause of the disease. AMKD affects more patients worldwide than CF, which translates to yet another massive potential market for Vertex."", 'Last but not least, Vertex is evaluating two cell therapies in early-stage testing that hold the potential to cure type 1 diabetes. If these programs are successful, Vertex just might be one of the top five drugmakers in the world in the next decade.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Vertex Pharmaceuticals right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

Though carbonation snobs have been known to complain that these soda fountains allow remnants from one drink to seep into the next pour, the Freestyle devices have been popular enough that more than 50,000 of them are in public use.', 'And yet, one mystery about the machines has popped up occasionally over time … If you are looking closely enough: Why do many of them have what appears to be a small camera lens embedded above the touch screen?', 'This question began with a tip passed along to this reporter: A salesman for a Big Tech company had boasted that Coca-Cola was capturing images of soda fountain customers through cameras, and then working with said cloud-computing giant to gain insights on customers’ facial reactions when they blend certain flavors together to create a custom drink. With that data, the thinking went, Coca-Cola might have new insights into new flavors it should consider producing.', 'A source who worked for Coca-Cola for many years told Fortune they had heard a similar rumor, but couldn’t confirm it for sure. A few Reddit posts also pondered the question of the camera hole with mostly unsatisfactory responses. And a Coca-Cola spec sheet found online for one of the Freestyle models lists an embedded camera as one of the soda fountain parts, along with “future capability for motion sense and facial recognition.” Hmm.', 'While a camera embedded in a soda machine might sound absurd, businesses and event venues are increasingly using new facial analysis and recognition technologies in public settings. MSG Entertainment, which owns the Madison Square Garden sports arena as well as other venues like Radio City Music Hall, has recently used facial recognition technology to bar lawyers working for firms engaged in legal battles with the company from attending any events at its New York venues. More airports are adding it at security checkpoints, too. And just this February, students at the University of Waterloo pressured its administration to remove vending machines secretly embedded with facial analysis technology.', 'So what does Coke have to say about all of this?', 'A spokesman for the company, Scott Leith, said in a statement: “Camera capabilities were included in earlier designs and tested in a laboratory setting in 2018 and 2019. The company has no plans to use cameras in the future.”', 'Leith did not elaborate on whether machines in the field still have cameras in them nor on the exact nature of the testing. But a patent application filed in the summer of 2018 by two former Coca-Cola employees may provide a snapshot of the intent, saying the system “may be able to determine the sentiment of the consumer.”', '“For example, whether a consumer who appears angry seems to appear happier after dispensing a beverage and/or whether the consumer enjoyed the beverage,” it says. “Such data also may be used to identify new mixes that are preferred by consumers … Entirely new beverage combinations thus may be created and promoted.” This reasoning sounds a lot like the original tip this reporter received.', 'The application also cited the potential for a soda machine to identify demographic information about a customer “for marketing purposes as well as for an improved consumer experience.”', '“The method may include the steps of sensing physical characteristics of the consumer, matching those physical characteristics of the consumer with demographic characteristics, promoting a beverage selection to the consumer based upon the matched demographic characteristics, and providing a beverage to the consumer,” the application read.', 'But there’s a bit more. As of last month, a case study on the website of an AI company called Quantiphi referenced working on a facial recognition project related to the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine.', '“Each vending machine comes with a camera installed, in which an image is captured for every customer interacting with the machine,” the case study on Quantiphi’s website read. “Coca Cola’s marketing team aspired to use these images to generate insights on consumer preferences and usage patterns,” including to “analyze the types of ‘mocktails’ preferred by their consumers.”', 'The mocktails in question reference when a Freestyle soda fountain customer creates their own drink by mixing two or more flavors available from the machine.', 'The case study also said that Quantiphi built “a custom machine learning model trained on 8,000 to 10,000 images, capable of detecting customer demographics … using facial feature recognition. As a result, Coca-Cola’s marketing team is able to capture and evaluate demographic details of customers, which are then used to develop focused marketing strategies and launch potential individual products, consequently driving growth.”', 'A Quantiphi spokesperson, Hadley Mayes, said the partnership occurred in 2017 but that it was just an experiment. Quantiphi later removed the case study from its website after Fortune inquired about it, saying it did not reflect the company’s current capabilities. Mayes declined to provide any more details on the initiative, such as where it took place or whether it was in a public setting, citing a nondisclosure agreement.', 'Today, thousands of Coca-Cola Freestyle machines remain in public view with a clear slot for a camera and some questions about how the company has used the cameras to date.

Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""At first glance, Sempra seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 9.5%. This probably goes some way in explaining Sempra's moderate 12% growth over the past five years amongst other factors."", ""As a next step, we compared Sempra's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 5.5%."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is SRE worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether SRE is currently mispriced by the market."", ""While Sempra has a three-year median payout ratio of 64% (which means it retains 36% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow."", ""Moreover, Sempra is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 51% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much."", ""On the whole, we feel that Sempra's performance has been quite good. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

If you want to skip our overview of the industrial sector, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Best Industrial Machinery Stocks to Invest in. ', 'The industrial machinery industry is one of the most capital intensive in the world. Setting up a firm that makes these machines is not an easy task, and it often requires years of expertise and hefty amounts of capital which until very recently were only available to sizeable nation states such as the United States and the Soviet Union.', 'Over the course of time, these companies, which often trace their roots back to the industrial boom in the U.S. during the second world war, have become private entities. At the same time, the high barriers of entry mean that not only are the top industrial machinery stocks among some of the most advanced companies in the world but also that these firms enjoy the comfort of economies of scale that are hard to compete with.', 'As an example, consider some of the most valuable industrial machinery stocks in terms of market capitalization. A couple of such firms are General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW), and Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN). General Electric, makes and sells some of the most advanced machines in the world. These include jet engines which are the backbone of the U.S. Air Force and nuclear reactors. These reactors are some of the most exacting engineered products on the planet due to the high stress environment in which they operate and the extreme catastrophe that awaits them should even the slightest thing go awry.', 'Similarly, Eaton plays an integral role in the global aviation supply chain. An average jet engine for a commercial airliner can contain as many as fifty thousand individual components, from high precision crystal fan blades to pipes, pumps, and hydraulic motors. All of these have to be kept in prime condition, and they are built to a standard that not many firms can achieve.', 'However, unlike high growth technology stocks, industrial machinery stocks are more down to Earth. Like their technology peers, their performance depends on interest rates since funding pricey manufacturing plants and other equipment requires loans. Similarly, the rosier the economic outlook is, the better industrial machinery stocks fare on the stock market since the demand for their products is assumed to be stable.', 'As an illustration of this aspect of industrial machinery stock performance, consider the shares of General Electric and Eaton. They bled as much as 51% of their share price value on the stock market after the coronavirus lockdowns were put into place, as investor outlook for the global economy darkened.', 'But what about recent stock performance? After all, investor expectations of an easing in interest rates could also generate tailwinds for industrial machinery stocks. 2024 has seen investors start off the year on an optimistic note for rate cuts, but settle with the knowledge that the Fed might take longer than they would like. Year to date, both GE and Eaton are up by 39% and 31%, respectively, with GE enjoying slightly higher returns in the wake of its announcement that it will split into two companies.', ""Analyzing industrial machinery stocks means that investors have to focus on their product portfolio and the potential to both reduce costs (often dubbed as 'improving margins') and gain market share. Both these themes were also present during the latest full hedge fund investor letter cycle which was for the fourth quarter of 2023."", 'For instance, Southeastern Asset Management mentioned General Electric in its investor letter for the period as it outlined:', 'General Electric - Industrial conglomerate General Electric (GE) was the top performer for the year. We exited this multi-year investment as its price went above our appraisal. In 1Q23, GE spun out GE Healthcare, which we sold as it traded at our value. The share price continued its strong performance throughout the spring and summer, and we ultimately sold the position in the third quarter when we no longer saw a margin of safety for the business. CEO Larry Culp was a great partner who created significant value for shareholders by reducing leverage, cutting costs, streamlining operations, improving company culture and simplifying the structure with plans to split the company into three businesses. We hope to have the opportunity to partner with him again in the future.', 'Artisan Partners was more detailed in its coverage of Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) when it shared:', 'Xylem is a global leader in water technology across pumps, smart meters and treatment services. More than 80% of the company’s sales come from markets where it maintains the No. 1 or No. 2 market position. Xylem’s pumps business (selling primarily to utilities) is a sticky and profitable operation that provides capital to invest in more innovative solutions, such as smart meters. In mid-2023, Xylem completed the acquisition of Evoqua, giving it a leading position in the US water treatment business. We believe the company is at the start of a compelling profit cycle. Smart meter sales are recovering from supply chain issues, cost and revenue synergies from the acquisition are in the early innings, and a newly hired (and well- respected) CFO should help catalyze long-awaited margin expansion. Meanwhile, rising demand for solutions to water sustainability challenges should persist as a strong trend for years to come.', 'Seems like smart money is, like always, aware of broader trends that could be helping industrial machinery stocks set themselves up for years of growth. Consequently, we decided to take a look at some such stocks and the notable names were Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH).', 'A factory floor filled with specialized drug manufacturing machinery and workers.', 'Our Methodology', 'To make our list of the best industrial machinery stocks, we ranked the most valuable specialty industrial machinery and heavy machinery stocks by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023 and picked out the top stocks.', 'For these best industrial machinery stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

That’s when GE, which spun off GE HealthCare last year, will split itself into GE Vernova and GE Aerospace.', 'The combination of Calhoun quitting, the end of the conglomerate, and General Electric’s name disappearing tells us a lot about how the world has changed since Welch was worshiped by the likes of Fortune Magazine (which named him the Manager of the Century in 1999) and the Financial Times (which named GE “The World’s Most Respected Company” for the third straight year in 2000, the year before Welch stepped down as CEO).', 'I wrote about the end of Welch’s legacy last year after Larry Culp, who became GE’s CEO in 2018, announced plans to split the company into three pieces, none of which would be named General Electric. As the Welch hagiography died down, the mess left behind showed that his genius was as much in playing accounting games as anything else.', 'Culp, the first GE chief executive who hadn’t been a company employee, succeeded two Welch acolytes in the position: John Flannery, who lasted 14 disastrous months, and Jeff Immelt, Welch’s chosen successor, who had lasted for 16 less-than-mediocre years before that.', 'After I finished laughing at the irony of Dave Calhoun stepping down the week before the name General Electric vanishes from the markets, I decided this would be a good time to compile a list of unsuccessful CEOs who were Jack Welch mentees.', 'I had no idea that the list would be so long.', 'I combined my knowledge from decades of writing about business with additional research, then read a 2022 book about Welch written by David Gelles, a New York Times journalist.

If you want to skip our overview of the US insurance industry and the latest trends and news, then you can take a look at the 5 Largest Insurance Companies in the US by Assets in 2024. ', ""A little known fact about the insurance industry is that it's one of the oldest in the world. The history of insurance dates back to the time of the Code of Hammurabi, one of the first sets of written laws in human history. Since then, the insurance industry has existed in one form or another, and in 2024, the sector has to battle cyber threats and be ready for challenges ushered in by changing global climate trends."", 'As an example, insurance in America has been through quite some trouble over the past couple of years. An insurance company works by collecting money from its customers, and then making payouts in case any of them suffers from an accident or any other untoward life event. The weakness that these companies have to contend with is that they might be unable to make payouts if too many customers qualify for them, and for Florida insurers such as Weston Property & Casualty Insurance Co., the Southern Fidelity Insurance Company, and UPC Insurance, the nightmare scenario materialized in 2022 and 2023 as they went bankrupt. For UPC, the catastrophe came just after the firm announced that it would leave Florida, but the decision came too late and Hurricane Ian caused too much damage for the firm to be able to fund.', 'Since then, at least the property and casualty insurance market in the U.S. is on more stable footing. One report that attempts to cover the state of the US insurance industry comes from the Swiss Re Institute. According to the analysis, personal insurance in America can benefit from lower inflation, as buyer budgets accommodate for more insurance plans. Additionally, the report also adds that the US insurance industry ended up underwriting $33 billion in losses in 2023, making it unsurprising that the Florida insurance industry is now a significantly different sector than it was at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.', ""Yet, while the US casualty insurance industry might be out of trouble for now, the first quarter of 2023 has also seen another sector become the center of media attention. This is the health insurance sector that seemingly got caught in the middle of a feud between law enforcement and ransomware organizations. One of America's biggest insurance companies, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), saw its claims processing disrupted in a cyberattack that saw reverberations all over America. This wasn't the end of the intrigue, as while UNH has since recovered, the group said to be responsible for the attack has pulled off a disappearing act."", ""According to Reuters, the ransomware group BlackHat's website now claims that the group has been taken down by coordinated action from law enforcement agencies. However, all agencies mentioned have either refused or failed to comment or outright denied disrupting the infrastructure."", 'Thought only casualty and health insurance were facing disruptions? Think again as March 2024 has also seen Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company inform nearly 30,000 customers that a data breach led to sensitive details such as Social Security numbers being compromised. For more on the UNH hack, you can also take a look at the 12 Best Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. To add to this, the collapse of the Francis Scott Bridge in Baltimore is also making marine insurers tremble. Experts believe that the partial bridge collapse could set new records in marine insurance, and some estimates believe that a payout could sit at a whopping $4 billion.', 'So, as the US insurance battles new challenges in the age of artificial intelligence, we decided to see which insurance companies in America have the greatest assets.

How about dividend income? Maybe you're even considering a stake in The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) but can't quite convince yourself to take the plunge. That's certainly understandable. The stock isn't cheap right now, and it's not like there's a ton of growth opportunity for this already-enormous outfit."", 'Just be careful of talking yourself out of a great stock pick. There are plenty of good reasons to take a swing at P&G at this time. Here are my top three.', ""Being a market-share leader doesn't inherently make the company's stock a buy. On the other hand, a category leader is usually a category leader for good reason. That reason is, the product is a superior one, and the company behind it knows exactly how to market it."", 'To this end, know that P&G owns the leading brand in several different categories of consumer goods. It makes many products you likely know, ranging from Pampers diapers to Tide laundry detergent to Gillette razors to Crest toothpaste, just to name a few. Roughly a dozen of its brands are U.S. market-share leaders at any given time and by more than a little.', 'Its Bounty paper towels, for instance, generate on the order of five times as much annual revenue as its nearest rival. Ditto for Gillette. P&G is even dominating the crowded laundry detergent market, with Tide products outselling the second-biggest domestic competitor by a ratio of four-to-one. Connect the dots: P&G is clearly doing something right.', ""As was noted, leading multiple markets doesn't necessarily make shares of the company behind those leading products a buy. Realistically speaking, it's tough to topple a category leader if for no other reason than the purchase of these companies' products eventually becomes a no-thought habit."", 'In P&G\'s case, this habit is further fueled by about $2 billion worth of annual brand ""superiority"" research and development, allowing the company to avoid entering a price war no combatant ever really wins. That\'s a powerful advantage, and a big part of the reason P&G\'s been able to plow right through the recent wave of inflationary pressure.', ""Greater size can be a disadvantage if a company doesn't deliberately manage the complexity and bureaucracy that often materializes with size. But P&G handles its heft rather well. The company regularly assesses and restructures as necessary, shedding the unplanned bloat that so easily builds when a large corporation isn't looking."", ""The company still retains all the advantages that do come with greater size, however. Take its marketing budget as an example. P&G is frequently the world's single-biggest advertiser in terms of total ad spending, shelling out on the order of $8 billion per year on TV, print, digital, and in-store promotional activity. Smaller rivals like Clorox and Unilever just can't keep up."", ""The competitive edge stemming from sheer size doesn't end there. With a bigger lineup of market-leading products, P&G also enjoys a great deal of leverage with its retail partners like Walmart and Kroger. This often leads to prominent placement of its products in stores as well as co-advertising spending, just to name a few benefits."", ""And yet, there's still more P&G can pay for that its competitors would find more challenging to do. The company's made major investments in artificial intelligence, for instance, which is being used in a variety of ways, like more efficient manufacturing and even more effective advertising."", ""Last but not least, interested investors can comfortably expect P&G to remain the dividend juggernaut that it currently is. P&G hasn't merely paid regular dividends for several decades now. As of this year, the company's upped its annual payout for 67 years in a row. As one of the market's longest-tenured dividend-growth outfits, P&G is going to do everything in its power to maintain this uninterrupted streak of yearly dividend-payment increases."", ""Perhaps more important than P&G's dividend track record is the fact that the company can afford to make these dividend payments without undermining its ability to invest in its own growth. For its fiscal 2023, ended in June of last year, P&G reported a profit of $5.90 per share and paid dividends of just under $3.68. This dividend-payout ratio of 62% leaves enough earnings behind to provide P&G with some fiscal flexibility or even fund stock buybacks."", ""Newcomers right now will be buying into P&G stock while the dividend yield is a respectable 2.3%. For perspective, the S&P 500's current dividend yield stands at 1.35%."", ""There are downsides in owning a stake in P&G as well. Its lack of growth is a big one. This year's expected top-line growth of 3.4% and next year's similarly modest projection of 3.9% is actually the long-term norm here; you can certainly find faster-growing prospects. This stock isn't exactly cheap either, priced at 25 times this year's projected per-share earnings."", 'Just keep the bigger picture in mind. Investors can expect -- and should be willing -- to pay a premium for a reliable, quality pick and a strong dividend payer. Procter & Gamble may just be what your portfolio needs right now.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Procter & Gamble right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Procter & Gamble, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Procter & Gamble wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our overview of the industrial sector, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Best Industrial Machinery Stocks to Invest in. ', 'The industrial machinery industry is one of the most capital intensive in the world. Setting up a firm that makes these machines is not an easy task, and it often requires years of expertise and hefty amounts of capital which until very recently were only available to sizeable nation states such as the United States and the Soviet Union.', 'Over the course of time, these companies, which often trace their roots back to the industrial boom in the U.S. during the second world war, have become private entities. At the same time, the high barriers of entry mean that not only are the top industrial machinery stocks among some of the most advanced companies in the world but also that these firms enjoy the comfort of economies of scale that are hard to compete with.', 'As an example, consider some of the most valuable industrial machinery stocks in terms of market capitalization. A couple of such firms are General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW), and Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN). General Electric, makes and sells some of the most advanced machines in the world. These include jet engines which are the backbone of the U.S. Air Force and nuclear reactors. These reactors are some of the most exacting engineered products on the planet due to the high stress environment in which they operate and the extreme catastrophe that awaits them should even the slightest thing go awry.', 'Similarly, Eaton plays an integral role in the global aviation supply chain. An average jet engine for a commercial airliner can contain as many as fifty thousand individual components, from high precision crystal fan blades to pipes, pumps, and hydraulic motors. All of these have to be kept in prime condition, and they are built to a standard that not many firms can achieve.', 'However, unlike high growth technology stocks, industrial machinery stocks are more down to Earth. Like their technology peers, their performance depends on interest rates since funding pricey manufacturing plants and other equipment requires loans. Similarly, the rosier the economic outlook is, the better industrial machinery stocks fare on the stock market since the demand for their products is assumed to be stable.', 'As an illustration of this aspect of industrial machinery stock performance, consider the shares of General Electric and Eaton. They bled as much as 51% of their share price value on the stock market after the coronavirus lockdowns were put into place, as investor outlook for the global economy darkened.', 'But what about recent stock performance? After all, investor expectations of an easing in interest rates could also generate tailwinds for industrial machinery stocks. 2024 has seen investors start off the year on an optimistic note for rate cuts, but settle with the knowledge that the Fed might take longer than they would like. Year to date, both GE and Eaton are up by 39% and 31%, respectively, with GE enjoying slightly higher returns in the wake of its announcement that it will split into two companies.', ""Analyzing industrial machinery stocks means that investors have to focus on their product portfolio and the potential to both reduce costs (often dubbed as 'improving margins') and gain market share. Both these themes were also present during the latest full hedge fund investor letter cycle which was for the fourth quarter of 2023."", 'For instance, Southeastern Asset Management mentioned General Electric in its investor letter for the period as it outlined:', 'General Electric - Industrial conglomerate General Electric (GE) was the top performer for the year. We exited this multi-year investment as its price went above our appraisal. In 1Q23, GE spun out GE Healthcare, which we sold as it traded at our value. The share price continued its strong performance throughout the spring and summer, and we ultimately sold the position in the third quarter when we no longer saw a margin of safety for the business. CEO Larry Culp was a great partner who created significant value for shareholders by reducing leverage, cutting costs, streamlining operations, improving company culture and simplifying the structure with plans to split the company into three businesses. We hope to have the opportunity to partner with him again in the future.', 'Artisan Partners was more detailed in its coverage of Xylem Inc.

Xylem’s pumps business (selling primarily to utilities) is a sticky and profitable operation that provides capital to invest in more innovative solutions, such as smart meters. In mid-2023, Xylem completed the acquisition of Evoqua, giving it a leading position in the US water treatment business. We believe the company is at the start of a compelling profit cycle. Smart meter sales are recovering from supply chain issues, cost and revenue synergies from the acquisition are in the early innings, and a newly hired (and well- respected) CFO should help catalyze long-awaited margin expansion. Meanwhile, rising demand for solutions to water sustainability challenges should persist as a strong trend for years to come.', 'Seems like smart money is, like always, aware of broader trends that could be helping industrial machinery stocks set themselves up for years of growth.

If you want to skip our overview of the US insurance industry and the latest trends and news, then you can take a look at the 5 Largest Insurance Companies in the US by Assets in 2024. ', ""A little known fact about the insurance industry is that it's one of the oldest in the world. The history of insurance dates back to the time of the Code of Hammurabi, one of the first sets of written laws in human history. Since then, the insurance industry has existed in one form or another, and in 2024, the sector has to battle cyber threats and be ready for challenges ushered in by changing global climate trends."", 'As an example, insurance in America has been through quite some trouble over the past couple of years. An insurance company works by collecting money from its customers, and then making payouts in case any of them suffers from an accident or any other untoward life event. The weakness that these companies have to contend with is that they might be unable to make payouts if too many customers qualify for them, and for Florida insurers such as Weston Property & Casualty Insurance Co., the Southern Fidelity Insurance Company, and UPC Insurance, the nightmare scenario materialized in 2022 and 2023 as they went bankrupt. For UPC, the catastrophe came just after the firm announced that it would leave Florida, but the decision came too late and Hurricane Ian caused too much damage for the firm to be able to fund.', 'Since then, at least the property and casualty insurance market in the U.S. is on more stable footing. One report that attempts to cover the state of the US insurance industry comes from the Swiss Re Institute. According to the analysis, personal insurance in America can benefit from lower inflation, as buyer budgets accommodate for more insurance plans. Additionally, the report also adds that the US insurance industry ended up underwriting $33 billion in losses in 2023, making it unsurprising that the Florida insurance industry is now a significantly different sector than it was at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.', ""Yet, while the US casualty insurance industry might be out of trouble for now, the first quarter of 2023 has also seen another sector become the center of media attention. This is the health insurance sector that seemingly got caught in the middle of a feud between law enforcement and ransomware organizations. One of America's biggest insurance companies, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), saw its claims processing disrupted in a cyberattack that saw reverberations all over America. This wasn't the end of the intrigue, as while UNH has since recovered, the group said to be responsible for the attack has pulled off a disappearing act."", ""According to Reuters, the ransomware group BlackHat's website now claims that the group has been taken down by coordinated action from law enforcement agencies. However, all agencies mentioned have either refused or failed to comment or outright denied disrupting the infrastructure."", 'Thought only casualty and health insurance were facing disruptions? Think again as March 2024 has also seen Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company inform nearly 30,000 customers that a data breach led to sensitive details such as Social Security numbers being compromised.

To add to this, the collapse of the Francis Scott Bridge in Baltimore is also making marine insurers tremble.

If you want to read further about dividend investing, go directly to have a look at 10 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.\xa0', ""Investors tend to gravitate towards investments that provide them with income, and dividend stocks are particularly popular in this regard. These stocks stand out for their ability to generate consistent income streams. Dividends represent a share of a company's profits that are allocated to its shareholders either as cash payments or in the form of additional shares of stock. Investing in dividends may appear simple at first glance, as it involves investors anticipating regular payments on a quarterly, monthly, or yearly basis. However, this investment strategy involves a multitude of considerations when selecting suitable stocks. Key factors include the growth rate of dividends, the compounding impact of reinvesting dividends, payout ratios, cash flow analysis, and dividend yields. Understanding these elements is essential for making informed decisions when venturing into dividend stock investments."", 'One of the key factors that greatly attracts investors is the consistent increase in dividends over time. Stocks that consistently raise their dividends have historically demonstrated superior performance, delivering enhanced returns to shareholders. These types of stocks become particularly valuable during periods of financial instability or economic downturns when investors seek reliable income streams. Examples of top dividend stocks renowned for their sustained dividend growth include Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP). These companies have consistently rewarded shareholders with growing dividends over the years.', 'Investing in dividends offers multiple avenues for investors to explore, and when executed effectively, it has the potential to create substantial wealth for individuals. For this reason, we have compiled a list of 25 things every dividend investor should know.', 'Photo by Marga Santoso on Unsplash', 'Over an extended period, dividend-paying stocks have played a substantial role in driving the overall returns of the market. A study conducted by Hartford Funds revealed that between 1940 and 2023, dividends accounted for an average of 34% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index. Additionally, during decades such as the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, where total returns were below 10%, dividends made a significant contribution to the overall returns. Another study conducted by S&P Dow Jones Indices highlighted the impact of dividend-paying stocks on overall investment returns throughout the 2000s. According to the report, dividend income accounted for approximately 68% of the total returns during that decade.', 'Stocks that do not pay dividends have consistently underperformed dividend-paying stocks over time, particularly in certain market situations. For instance, during market downturns such as the one witnessed in 2022, where the S&P 500 Index dropped by over 18%, dividend-paying assets demonstrated their capacity to shield investors from significant losses. In 2022, stocks listed in the S&P 500 that distributed dividends experienced a decline of 11.1%, while those that did not pay dividends suffered a much steeper loss of 38.7%.', 'Analyzing the performance over the long term reveals the robust returns delivered by dividend-paying companies. Research from Hartford Funds indicated that from 1973 to 2023, companies distributing dividends achieved an average annual return of 9.17%. In contrast, non-dividend-paying companies yielded a significantly lower average return of 4.27% over the same period. Furthermore, companies that maintained consistent dividend policies throughout this timeframe returned an average of 6.74%.', ""During market downturns, investors often grapple with concerns about their investments, particularly exacerbated by the impact of inflation. Fortunately, dividend stocks have demonstrated resilience during inflationary periods compared to other asset classes. According to a report by Hartford Funds, between 1970 and 2022, there were eight such inflationary periods, during which dividend-paying companies consistently outperformed their non-dividend-paying counterparts. The report highlighted the 1970s as one of the most notorious periods of American inflation, driven by surging oil prices. Despite market challenges, dividends played a pivotal role, accounting for a significant portion of returns, with as much as 73% of the S&P 500's returns attributed to dividends during this time."", 'One of the main reasons for this outperformance of dividend stocks is their tendency to generate substantial free cash flow. Unlike growth-focused companies that prioritize reinvestment for expansion, dividend-paying companies have established revenue streams and financial stability, making them more resilient in slowing growth or recessionary environments. Their ability to maintain consistent dividend payments reflects their sound financial health and adaptability during adverse market conditions.', 'Over time, inflation gradually diminishes the purchasing power of currency, posing challenges for income investors. However, dividends offer a notable advantage during periods of high inflation due to their potential for growth compared to fixed bond coupons. Research from BlackRock underscored this, revealing that over the past 150 years, dividends from U.S. companies have experienced an average annual growth rate of 3.7%, outpacing the average annual inflation rate of 2%.', 'Wisdom Tree conducted research confirming that dividends have consistently surpassed inflation rates. Their findings indicate that between 1957 and 2022, dividends experienced an average annual growth of 5.7%, exceeding the inflation rate by more than 2%. Similarly, from 1990 to 2022, dividends from the S&P 500 grew by 5.61%, while inflation only saw a growth of 2.64% during the same period. This highlights the ability of dividends to provide investors with a hedge against inflation and potentially enhance their purchasing power over time.', 'The regular dividend payments paid to investors act as a buffer during market downturns, providing stability to the stock’s price. In addition to this, companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders have stable cash flows and established business models, which can lower the volatility. Wisdom Tree reported that stock prices are over two times more volatile than dividend stocks. The firm gathered data from the last 64 years and highlighted that there were only six instances during this period where dividends decreased, and only one of those cases saw a decline of over 5%. In comparison, stock prices experienced declines in 18 of those years, with the most severe yearly decline surpassing 40%. The report also mentioned that on average, stocks fell by more than 11% annually during that period.', 'Companies that regularly grow their dividends are particularly less volatile than other asset classes. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, when the market experienced declines between December 31, 1999, and March 31, 2022, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats showed better performance compared to both the S&P Composite 1500 and the S&P 500 High Dividend Index, outpacing by 140 basis points per month and by 49 basis points per month, respectively.', 'The payout ratio is one of the most useful important metrics for evaluating dividend-paying companies. This mainly analyses how much of a company’s income is being distributed among its shareholders in the form of dividends. A high payout ratio is not considered healthy, as it shows that a company is paying more than it can afford. On the other hand, a low ratio indicates that a company is maintaining more earnings for reinvestments and to fulfill shareholder obligations. According to analysts, the dividend payout ratio of between 35% and 55% is considered healthy as it shows that the company has enough money left over to reinvest for growth.', 'The Wellington Management did a detailed study on that and categorized dividend-paying stocks in the S&P 500 into quintiles based on their dividend yields and payout ratios. The highest dividend-paying stocks, representing the top 20%, comprised the first quintile, while the lowest and non-payers constituted the fifth quintile. Over nine decades, from 1930 to 2019, the study examined the performance of each quintile. Results showed that second-quintile stocks outperformed the S&P 500 in seven out of nine periods, accounting for 77.8% of the time. The first and third quintiles tied for second place, outperforming the index in six out of nine periods. However, fourth and fifth-quintile stocks performed less favorably, outperforming the index in only four instances each. One explanation for the outperformance of second-quintile dividend stocks compared to the first quintile is their lower average dividend payout ratio. The first-quintile payout ratio averaged slightly above 70%, while the second-quintile payout ratio averaged just over 40%.', ""Investors often consider high dividend yield as an advantageous feature when investing in dividend stocks. However, high yields are not always practical as this could be a sign that the stock price has fallen significantly, which could be a sign of an underlying issue within the company. In addition to this, high-dividend stocks can be more volatile because they are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and market conditions. The Wellington Management study discovered that stocks with the highest levels of dividend payouts and yields have shown strong performance over time. However, they didn't perform as well as stocks that pay high, though not the absolute highest, levels of dividend payouts and yields."", 'According to analysts, a dividend yield between 3% and 5% is generally considered healthy as this range creates a balance between being neither excessively high nor too low. According to a report by Nuveen, global dividend-paying companies with a more moderate yield (0-3%) typically exhibit stronger potential for earnings growth, more robust profitability metrics, and higher profit margins in comparison to high dividend-yielding companies (those with yields above 3%) and companies that do not pay dividends at all. These factors often contribute to reducing risk, particularly during periods of heightened market volatility.', 'High dividend yields, when combined with a track record of consistent dividend growth record, can offer great investment opportunities for investors. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (NYSE:TDS), and British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI) are some of the best stocks in this regard as these companies have consistently raised their payouts for years and also boast above-average dividend yields.', 'As mentioned above, dividend growers take the lead among investors when it comes to investing in dividend stocks. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index seeks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some examples of dividend aristocrat stocks that are popular among investors. Their ability to raise dividends consistently stems from their strong balance sheets and stable cash generation. Due to these qualities, these stocks have performed better than others over the course of history. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the Dividend Aristocrat index has shown a notable capacity to protect against downturns, as evidenced by their upside and downside capture ratios. The report highlighted that these stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 around 69.34% of the time during down months and approximately 43.6% of the time during up months. Dividend aristocrats also delivered an average excess return of 1.05% in down months over the broader market index. In addition to this, the index experienced lower drawdown levels compared to the S&P 500.', 'The outperformance of dividend aristocrats also brings in the factor of high dividend yields, highlighting the advantage that dividend growers hold over those with simply high yields. ProShares reported that dividend growth has consistently demonstrated strong performance regardless of the direction of the interest rates. According to the report, from May 2005 to December 2023, the Dividend Aristocrats index delivered an 11.55% return in rising interest rate periods, compared with a 10.46% return of high-yield dividend stocks, represented by the Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index. Similarly, in falling interest rate periods, dividend aristocrats returned 12.50%, surpassing a 7.90% return of high dividend stocks. Overall during this period, dividend growers yielded a 12% return, outperforming high-yield stocks, which delivered a 9.27% return.', 'The importance of dividend growth cannot be emphasized enough as it reflects the company’s financial health and strength. The consistency in growing dividends shows that the company is generating sustainable earnings and has confidence in its future payouts. Abrdn reported that dividend growers and initiators delivered a compounded return of 10.68% from December 2002 to December 2022, significantly outperforming dividend cutters and eliminators, which returned 2.70% during this period. Non-dividend payers were also behind companies with regular dividend growth, returning 9.25% within this timeframe.', 'Dividend growth and strong cash flow go hand in hand because this serves as a testament to the company’s financial health and stability. These companies generate reliable and consistent earnings from their main operations, which provides a solid foundation for maintaining and growing dividend payments over time. In addition to this, these companies can smoothly invest in growth initiatives, research and development, and other strategic opportunities with the ample cash that they generate.', 'Following in the trend, analysts are positive about dividend growth in the future as the cash on the corporate balance sheets has increased significantly over the years. According to a report by Global Market Intelligence, 13 non-financial S&P 500 companies collectively hold cash and investments of over $1 trillion, as of September 2023. These include some of the strongest dividend companies, such as Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM),\xa0 and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH).', ""The data we have mentioned in this article so far highlights the importance of dividend stocks in the long run. However, some investors also exploit dividend equities for short-term gains through a strategy called dividend capture strategy. The goal of this approach is to secure the dividend payment while minimizing exposure to the stock's price movements. The ex-dividend date is the day on which a stock begins trading without the dividend payment included in its price. Investors who own the stock on or before the ex-dividend date are entitled to receive the dividend payment."", 'Dividend stocks are found across a variety of industries and sectors, including technology, healthcare, consumer goods, finance, utilities, and more. Certain sectors pay higher dividends compared to others and have varying dividend yields. Real estate and utilities sectors exhibit the highest dividend yields, averaging around 4%. On the other hand, though the tech sector merged as the winner in 2023, it tends to offer lower yields, averaging below 1%. As of 2023, the energy sector has taken the spotlight for raising its dividends and launching debt reduction programs, replacing both utilities and real estate. Both these sectors have announced various dividend cuts throughout the year, mainly due to fluctuating interest rates. That said, these three sectors still make up the best investment options for income investors as there are a lot of undervalued opportunities within them, according to Morningstar chief US market strategist David Sekera.', 'What could be better than owning one dividend stock? Investing in a basket of dividend stocks and dividend ETFs offers exactly that. ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, are investment funds that trade on stock exchanges and hold a diversified portfolio of stocks from various sectors and industries. By investing in dividend ETFs, investors can gain exposure to a wide range of companies, effectively eliminating risks associated with investing heavily in a single sector or stock. Dividend ETFs were popular among investors in 2022 but due to the tech rally last year, these funds also saw a decline in their inflows. Nevertheless, dividend funds gathered a total of $3.9 billion in 2023, which, unfortunately, is their lowest annual collection since 2009 (see 11 Best Dividend ETFs to Buy Now)', 'The prices of dividend stocks can also fluctuate as these equities are not completely immune to market downturns. They can provide a hedge against inflationary periods, but that performance mainly depends on a number of factors. Dividend payments aren’t guaranteed, unlike the interest payments from the Treasuries. Companies can reduce or eliminate their payouts at any point in time, a risk that became evident during the pandemic of 2020 when approximately 68 out of roughly 380 dividend-paying companies in the S&P 500 either suspended or decreased their dividends.', 'High-interest rates have been a cause of worry for investors since 2022. In our article titled 13 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates, we highlighted that between March 2022 and July 2023, the Federal Reserve implemented a series of 11 rate hikes to the federal funds rate. In addition to this, interest rates in the broader bond market rose, leading to increased borrowing expenses for both businesses and individuals. In this aspect, dividend stocks have offered investors a sense of relief as they typically hold up better during periods of high-interest rates.', 'According to a report by ProShares, dividend growth strategies, which include companies that have raised their payouts consistently for years, are often considered reliable approaches that perform effectively across different interest rate climates. These strategies have demonstrated strong performance over the years regardless of fluctuations in interest rates. The report further mentioned that portfolios investing in dividend growth stocks can experience both capital appreciation and increasing dividend income streams, even in rising interest rate environments.', 'Click to continue reading and see 10 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.\xa0', 'Suggested articles:', '11 Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds', '15 Best 5G Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds', '11 Best April Dividend Stocks To Invest In', 'Disclosure.

One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.43 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Union Pacific has a better ROE than the average (14%) in the Transportation industry.', ""That is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk ."", ""Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same."", ""Union Pacific clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.19. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it."", 'Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.', 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings.

Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 19%. As you might expect, the 18% net income decline reported by Gap is a bit of a surprise.

Cultural ethos focusing on diligence, perseverance, and pride in work contribute largely. Effective economic policies promoting productivity, innovation, and fair compensation also play a crucial role. Moreover, a strong education system that equips citizens with relevant skills and fosters a strong work ethic enhances productivity. While hardwork is not bound by socially constructed identities, Indians were found to be the most hardworking ethnic group in the world, according to a survey.\xa0"", 'Recent data confirms that hard work is considered more important than talent in achieving success.

This belief is widespread, with 65% of Americans confirming the importance of effort in their lives, and 91% of employers preferring to promote hard-working employees.', 'Studies back this up, showing that students who attribute success to effort perform better than those who credit talent alone.

Shockingly, the youth unemployment rate has soared to 21.3%, highlighting the bleak job market conditions.
