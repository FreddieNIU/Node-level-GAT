Based on the last payment, Charles Schwab was earning enough to cover the dividend, but free cash flows weren't positive. With the company not bringing in any cash, paying out to shareholders is bound to become difficult at some point."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 90.4% over the next year.

However, Charles Schwab's EPS was effectively flat over the past five years, which could stop the company from paying more every year. While EPS growth is quite low, Charles Schwab has the option to increase the payout ratio to return more cash to shareholders."", ""In summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Charles Schwab's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While Charles Schwab is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking.

Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 17% per year.

The biggest factor in the marketwide rally is the tech sector -- specifically big tech -- where the market caps have gotten so large that a few companies alone can move the entire market.', 'There are currently five companies with a market capitalization of over $1 trillion: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. And there are just 12 companies with a market cap of over half a trillion dollars, which are those five plus Meta Platforms, Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla, Eli Lilly, Taiwan Semiconductor, Broadcom, and Visa.', ""It could take a while, but I believe that within the next three to five years, Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) will become the first company with over 50 consecutive annual dividend raises -- known as a Dividend King -- to surpass $500 billion in market value. Here's why P&G has what it takes to reach this milestone."", 'There are currently 54 Dividend Kings, but only seven of them have a market cap of around $200 billion or more.', 'Walmart is the leader with a $437 billion market value. It would need to gain just 14.4% to reach $500 billion. I like Walmart, but the rally since its last reported earnings has been largely unjustified. Walmart is dealing with a slew of challenges. And unlike its peer Target, which remains down over 47% from its all-time high, Walmart is down less than 5% from its all-time high.', 'Target has more of a consumer discretionary mix than Walmart, and it mismanaged its inventory and supply chain in recent times. However, the fact remains that Walmart is facing low growth. Its net income is virtually unchanged from 10 years ago, and its operating margin is relatively low as well.', ""After reporting fiscal 2024 third-quarter results in November, Walmart stock initially sold off before falling even further, to around $150 a share. It's been a sizable bounce since then for no real reason. Walmart is still a solid long-term holding for its recession resilience and growing dividend. But the above market valuation with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 27 leaves too much room for a sell-off."", 'P&G has to outperform Walmart by quite a bit to beat it to $500 billion in market value. But there are a few reasons it could pull this off.', 'P&G is generating practically as much free cash flow (FCF) as net income. Revenue growth has been solid, and its margins have held up despite a challenging operating environment. P&G has several partners and deals through different sales channels, so it can sustain higher margins than a pure-play retailer. Despite clocking in at a whopping $348 billion market cap, P&G is a lean business.', 'P&G routinely generates far more sales than it needs to run the business -- hence the high margins and FCF. It passes that cash flow to shareholders through a growing dividend and buybacks.', ""While dividends won't help P&G grow its market cap, they provide an incentive to hold a stock through periods of volatility. Not only is P&G one of the longest-tenured Dividend Kings, but its dividend also yields 2.6%, which is quite a bit higher than Walmart's 1.4%."", 'As for the buybacks, P&G has reduced its outstanding share count by 13% over the past decade compared to 16.6% for Walmart. Both companies have done an excellent job boosting earnings per share through buybacks, which has helped make both companies a better value when organic growth is sluggish.', 'P&G also looks like a far better value than Walmart. P&G sports a P/E ratio of 24 and a price-to-FCF ratio of 25.1. By comparison, Walmart has a P/E ratio of 26.9 and a price-to-FCF ratio of\xa034.6.', ""Coincidentally, Coca-Cola\xa0has an almost identical valuation to P&G, with a P/E ratio of 23.9 and a price-to-FCF ratio of 25.4. The difference is that Coke would have to nearly double to reach $500 billion in market size. Coke is a worthy dividend stock with a solid 3.1% yield. But when it comes to a race among Dividend Kings, it's just too small and similar to P&G to compete at this time."", ""It wouldn't surprise me if Walmart touched a $500 billion market cap before P&G on a whim of market exuberance. But in terms of which company will surpass that market cap and stay above the threshold, I think no Dividend King holds a candle to P&G."", 'P&G is, in many ways, a perfect business. There is almost nothing not to like about it. Despite improving fundamentals, the stock has gone practically nowhere over the last year and is down around 10% from its all-time high. That makes it stand out as a buying opportunity.', ""It may take three to five years, but it wouldn't surprise me one bit if P&G gains at least 43% to surpass $500 billion in market value -- all while rewarding its shareholders handsomely with predictable buybacks and a growing dividend."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Procter & Gamble right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Procter & Gamble, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Procter & Gamble wasn't one of them.

Additionally, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) will offer a bonus of up to 200% of base pay to store managers.\xa0', 'Approximately 75% of Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)’s field management teams, like store managers, began their careers in hourly roles. The salary adjustments will impact managers across different pay ranges, with those at the lowest end seeing the largest increases, from $65,000 to $90,000, while those at the top end will remain at $170,000. The changes in pay align with Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) ongoing efforts to increase starting wages, bringing the US average hourly wage to over $18 soon. These adjustments could potentially enhance Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) recruitment and retention strategies in the competitive job market.', ""In 2023, the US economy exhibited unexpected strength by adding 216,000 jobs, surpassing economists' forecast of 175,000.

Notably, wage-growth did accelerate, with average hourly pay rising to $34.27 and a yearly increase of 4.1%, slightly above the Fed's target. However, the labor force participation rate declined to 62.5%, marking the biggest drop in nearly three years, potentially complicating the Fed's task of managing inflation. As the job market is anticipated to cool further in 2024, the rise in wage growth and decrease in participation may influence the Federal Reserve to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period."", ""Speaking of wage growth, Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) has announced major benefits for its hourly employees in 2024, with a minimum 3% pay raise (4-5% based on tenure), scheduling improvements, and career mobility opportunities. These changes have come amid the company's ongoing legal battles with Workers United and efforts to enhance the employee experience before potential unionization. The benefits rollout includes pay raises effective January 1, 2024, with additional perks such as the first-ever Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX)\xa0 Barista championships (Feb.-June 2024) and an announcement of a new Siren credit card.

The rise of Magnificent Seven stocks like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and\xa0 Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a sign of the market\'s concentration in quality as investors flocked to companies with strong balance sheets and fundamentals. But what exactly are quality stocks? Billionaire Cliff Asness, Andrea Frazzini, and Lasse H. Pedersen wrote a research paper in 2013 titled ""Quality Minus Junk"" in which they defined quality stocks as follows:', '""We define a quality security as one that has characteristics that, all-else-equal, an investor should be willing to pay a higher price for: stocks that are safe, profitable, growing, and well managed. High quality stocks do have higher prices on average, but not by a very large margin. Perhaps because of this puzzlingly modest impact of quality on price, high-quality stocks have high risk-adjusted returns. Indeed, a quality-minus-junk (QMJ) factor that goes long high-quality stocks and shorts low-quality stocks earns significant risk-adjusted returns in the U.S. and globally across 24 countries. The price of quality – i.e., how much investors pay extra for higher quality stocks – varies over time, reaching a low during the internet bubble.""', 'While the market is expecting rate cuts this year, rising geopolitical tensions and a persistent inflation is keeping the demand for quality stocks higher. Almost all notable investment firms including Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs recommended investors to buy high quality names for 2024.

A latest Wall Street Journal report quoted data from UBS which said the MSCI ACWI Quality Index has beaten the MSCI’s global index by 1 percentage point over six-month periods in which the economic growth slowed.', 'The research paper from Cliff Asness we mentioned earlier also talked about the returns of quality stocks during troubled times:', '""Our results present a puzzle for asset pricing. They are consistent with quality stocks being underpriced and junk stocks overpriced or, alternatively, with quality stocks being riskier than junk stocks. However, while one can never rule out a risk explanation for the high return of quality stocks, we are unable to identify this risk; in anything, we find evidence of the opposite. We show that quality stocks are low beta and, rather than exhibiting crash risk, if anything they benefit from “flight to quality,” that is, they have a tendency to perform well during periods of extreme market distress. These findings present a challenge for risk-based explanations where bad states of the world are negatively correlated to extreme return realizations of the market factor. Finally, we show that the price of quality varies over time, generating a time-varying expected return on quality-minus-junk portfolios: a low price of quality predicts a high future return of quality stocks relative to junk stocks.""', 'Photo by Adam Nowakowski on Unsplash', 'Methodology', 'For this article we first listed down all holdings of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF with PE ratios less than 30 as of January 26.

However, a few generous dividend payers stand out as great income investments right now. Three Fool.com tech writers are here to share their best dividend ideas right now."", 'Read on to get the deep-dive dividend details on Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Universal Display (NASDAQ: OLED), and Microchip Technology (NASDAQ: MCHP). Each one offers a tantalizing blend of technology leadership, potential for long-term business growth, and a solid history of dividend growth.', ""Nicholas Rossolillo (Qualcomm): By now, you've probably heard that the semiconductor industry has been in a deep slump since the second half of 2022, led downward by consumer electronics. Qualcomm, a leader in mobile chips and the underlying technology that enables mobile devices, has taken it on the chin. Revenue fell 19% in fiscal year 2023 (which ended in September 2023), including a 24% year-over-year dive in sales in the final months of the fiscal period."", 'And yet, Qualcomm remained highly profitable by all metrics during the downturn last year. Not all top semiconductor companies could brag about that.', 'In fact, thanks to a record increase in its inventory of chips, and some of that inventory now getting sold to customers, Qualcomm refilled its coffers. Cash and short-term investments went from $6.4 billion at the end of fiscal 2022 to $11.3 billion at the end of September 2023. And along the way, Qualcomm actually increased its dividend, returning a record $3.46 billion in cash to shareholders last year -- currently good for an annualized dividend yield of 2.1%.', 'Qualcomm also doles out excess cash generated from its business in the form of stock repurchases. Last year, that cash returned via repurchases was $3 billion, another 2% of the current market cap.', ""Free cash flow (from which dividends and stock buybacks are made) totaled nearly $10 billion in fiscal 2023. And with the smartphone market much healthier than in times past, Qualcomm could post an equally good year in 2024, leaving ample room for another dividend payout increase or more stock buybacks. This is one of the top reasons I've been adding to my position in this top mobile chip stock to start the new year."", ""Anders Bylund (Universal Display): Once upon a time, it seemed kind of silly to talk about Universal Display as a dividend investment. The display technology expert's first payout came in February 2017, offering a modest $0.03 per share. The forward yield worked out to a meager 0.2% at the time, based on a share price of roughly $67. That policy is hardly worth the paper it's written on, right? I mean, a company developing the patent-protected technologies behind organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens must be a high-growth tech stock, not a sleepy dividend play."", 'Well, you can actually have it both ways.', 'Dividend investments require a stern focus on a time horizon many years away. Universal Display powered its payouts from a surprisingly deep well of free cash flows, promising hefty dividend increases over the years. Nearly seven years and six payout increases later, the forgettable dividends of old have grown to a respectable $0.35 per quarter or $1.40 annually.', ""That works out to a 0.8% yield if you're buying in at today's prices, around the $180 mark. But if you picked up a few Universal Display shares when the payouts started, you're looking at an effective annual yield of 2.1% on that investment. The company's original position in my current portfolio, started almost exactly 12 years ago, now provides a 4.3% yield against the starting price of $32.41 per share."", ""You see, it's all about those free-flowing cash profits and the company's commitment to splitting that extra cash with shareholders. I expect another payout bump next month, as the company tends to announce each year's first payout near the end of February."", ""The dividend increases have averaged 53% across the six existing bumps, including a 17% boost on the heels of the ghastly market trends in 2022. Free cash flows look a little soft right now due to Universal Display's mid-2023 buyout of 550 OLED patents from German science and materials giant Merck KGaA. That deal made a $66 million dent in Universal Display's cash flows in last year's second quarter, but the cash profits are already trending upward again."", ""On top of Universal Display's top-quality dividend policy, the company is poised to make a mint in a stabilizing economy, as consumers start looking for new phones and high-end TV sets again. Furthermore, the company's target market should expand significantly in the coming years thanks to upgraded manufacturing processes, wider availability of OLED-based lighting panels, and new categories of electronics getting the power-sipping OLED upgrade."", ""These catalysts should send Universal Display's stalled price chart higher in the coming years. The time to buy is now, before that potential hockey-stick moment plays out. Universal Display's increasingly generous dividends may never be this affordable again."", 'Billy Duberstein (Microchip): AI-related chip and equipment stocks are rocketing to all-time highs. However, industrial and auto-related chips, which had been resilient throughout 2022 and for much of 2023, are now entering their post-pandemic correction. So that part of the market may be a good place to look for dividend tech stocks.', 'Microcontroller and analog chipmaker Microchip just preannounced its December-ended quarter, indicating that revenue would be down 22%, as opposed to its November guidance of down 15% to 20%. Management indicated the shortfall was due to a combination of customers cutting back inventory in response to a weakening demand environment, as well as some extended holiday shutdowns, which caused some shipments to move from the December-ended quarter to the March-ended quarter.', ""The strange thing is that the day after that announcement, Microchip's stock was actually up. When a chip stock doesn't go down or actually goes up on bad news, it usually means investors think it is nearing the bottom of the current cycle."", 'Despite the cyclicality that all chip companies experience, Microchip is fast becoming a high-margin blue chip name, so to speak, ever since it hit its target leverage a couple of years ago. That milestone came after five years of paying down the debt stemming from its huge 2018 Microsemi acquisition. But since hitting its leverage target, the company has turned to steadily ramping share repurchases and dividends, not just every year, but every quarter.', ""The plan is to increase cash returns to shareholders by 500 basis points as a percentage of free cash flow every quarter. In the latest quarter, Microchip returned $562 million to shareholders in dividends and repurchases, a figure that represented 77.5% of the previous quarter's free cash flow. Those cash returns will increase 5 percentage points every quarter until reaching 100% by March of 2025."", ""That means investors should look for Microchip's current 1.92%-yielding dividend to grow consistently.\xa0 After all, while the auto and industrial sectors are taking a pause right now, Microchip should be a low-double-digit compounder as autos and industrial equipment utilize more and more chip content every year."", ""Meanwhile, Microchip's stock trades at a very reasonable 20 times forward earnings estimates, and those estimates should indicate the trough of the cycle. That makes the stock a smart pickup for dividend growth investors in early 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Qualcomm right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Qualcomm wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF gained 29% in 2023, beating the S&P 500 returns of 24%. The rise of Magnificent Seven stocks like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and\xa0 Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a sign of the market\'s concentration in quality as investors flocked to companies with strong balance sheets and fundamentals. But what exactly are quality stocks? Billionaire Cliff Asness, Andrea Frazzini, and Lasse H. Pedersen wrote a research paper in 2013 titled ""Quality Minus Junk"" in which they defined quality stocks as follows:', '""We define a quality security as one that has characteristics that, all-else-equal, an investor should be willing to pay a higher price for: stocks that are safe, profitable, growing, and well managed. High quality stocks do have higher prices on average, but not by a very large margin. Perhaps because of this puzzlingly modest impact of quality on price, high-quality stocks have high risk-adjusted returns. Indeed, a quality-minus-junk (QMJ) factor that goes long high-quality stocks and shorts low-quality stocks earns significant risk-adjusted returns in the U.S. and globally across 24 countries. The price of quality – i.e., how much investors pay extra for higher quality stocks – varies over time, reaching a low during the internet bubble.""', 'While the market is expecting rate cuts this year, rising geopolitical tensions and a persistent inflation is keeping the demand for quality stocks higher. Almost all notable investment firms including Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs recommended investors to buy high quality names for 2024. Why? \xa0High-quality stocks tend to perform better when growth is slowing down. A latest Wall Street Journal report quoted data from UBS which said the MSCI ACWI Quality Index has beaten the MSCI’s global index by 1 percentage point over six-month periods in which the economic growth slowed.', 'The research paper from Cliff Asness we mentioned earlier also talked about the returns of quality stocks during troubled times:', '""Our results present a puzzle for asset pricing. They are consistent with quality stocks being underpriced and junk stocks overpriced or, alternatively, with quality stocks being riskier than junk stocks. However, while one can never rule out a risk explanation for the high return of quality stocks, we are unable to identify this risk; in anything, we find evidence of the opposite. We show that quality stocks are low beta and, rather than exhibiting crash risk, if anything they benefit from “flight to quality,” that is, they have a tendency to perform well during periods of extreme market distress. These findings present a challenge for risk-based explanations where bad states of the world are negatively correlated to extreme return realizations of the market factor. Finally, we show that the price of quality varies over time, generating a time-varying expected return on quality-minus-junk portfolios: a low price of quality predicts a high future return of quality stocks relative to junk stocks.""', 'Photo by Adam Nowakowski on Unsplash', 'Methodology', 'For this article we first listed down all holdings of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF with PE ratios less than 30 as of January 26.

We have also discussed the state of US labor market. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the Top 5 Industries That are Hiring Right Now.', ""In 2024, the US labor market is expected to show signs of stabilization after a tumultuous 2023. The unemployment rate, which reached 3.7% in November of 2023 is on a positive trajectory, and the Fed is considering interest-rate cuts. Despite concerns of a recession, the economy is defying expectations with a soft landing. Wages are anticipated to slow down, returning to pre-pandemic levels. While wages posted on Indeed were up 4.2% in October, it marks a decline from July's peak of 4.8% and January 2022's 9.3%. Merit increases are also expected to slow, with employers predicting a 3.5% rise in 2024, slightly below 2023 levels."", 'Hiring, while slowing, still holds promise, with 57% of managers expressing plans to increase permanent roles in the first half of 2024. The job market is forecasted to slow down further, making the present a relatively favorable time for job transitions. Layoffs, though unpredictable, are expected to remain low in 2024, standing at 41% lower than November 2022. However, there is a cautious note that a sudden increase to a more recessionary level could occur if the US slips into a downturn. Despite challenges, there is a prevailing optimism among employers towards 2024, with a focus on rightsizing and steady growth.', ""According to a recent analysis by career site Indeed, some companies in the US are hiring at a faster pace than others. Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG) topped the list with a relative hire rate of 2.29, making it the fastest in terms of hiring among the companies analyzed. Mariano's followed closely with a rate of 2.06, securing the second position. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranked at No. 8 with a relative hire rate of 1.68. The analysis focused on the period from August 1 to the end of October, and the companies on the list are still actively hiring.\xa0"", 'It is also worth highlighting that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s hiring will not be limited to the US alone. In fact, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is reportedly expanding its operations in Sweden by posting seven job openings for metal workers, painters, and claims adjusters at its Stockholm factory, despite ongoing sympathy strikes in the region. The conflict began when Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) mechanics in Sweden signed with the labor union IF Metall, but negotiations broke down as Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) refused to sign a collective agreement. Affiliated unions launched sympathy strikes affecting different aspects of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) business. The decision to hire nonunion workers suggests Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) commitment to its anti-union stance, potentially impacting US workers, who are the primary target of United Auto Workers leadership.', ""Speaking of Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG), their recent acquisition of SJR National Retail for $6 million may seem like a minor move, but it holds major implications for the jewelry retail industry. Despite a decline of 8.1% in Q2 revenues and a 12% drop in same-store sales, Signet's stock rose from $71 to almost $80 after surpassing analysts' estimates. The company maintained its year-end guidance with sales projected at $7.1 to $7.3 billion and an operating income between $635 million to $675 million.\xa0"", 'Notably, Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG)’s acquisition of SJR National Retail, a full-service jewelry and watch repair company, opened doors for business-to-business repair services to independent jewelers.

The iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF gained 29% in 2023, beating the S&P 500 returns of 24%. The rise of Magnificent Seven stocks like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and\xa0 Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a sign of the market\'s concentration in quality as investors flocked to companies with strong balance sheets and fundamentals. But what exactly are quality stocks? Billionaire Cliff Asness, Andrea Frazzini, and Lasse H. Pedersen wrote a research paper in 2013 titled ""Quality Minus Junk"" in which they defined quality stocks as follows:', '""We define a quality security as one that has characteristics that, all-else-equal, an investor should be willing to pay a higher price for: stocks that are safe, profitable, growing, and well managed. High quality stocks do have higher prices on average, but not by a very large margin. Perhaps because of this puzzlingly modest impact of quality on price, high-quality stocks have high risk-adjusted returns. Indeed, a quality-minus-junk (QMJ) factor that goes long high-quality stocks and shorts low-quality stocks earns significant risk-adjusted returns in the U.S. and globally across 24 countries. The price of quality – i.e., how much investors pay extra for higher quality stocks – varies over time, reaching a low during the internet bubble.""', 'While the market is expecting rate cuts this year, rising geopolitical tensions and a persistent inflation is keeping the demand for quality stocks higher. Almost all notable investment firms including Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs recommended investors to buy high quality names for 2024. Why? \xa0High-quality stocks tend to perform better when growth is slowing down. A latest Wall Street Journal report quoted data from UBS which said the MSCI ACWI Quality Index has beaten the MSCI’s global index by 1 percentage point over six-month periods in which the economic growth slowed.', 'The research paper from Cliff Asness we mentioned earlier also talked about the returns of quality stocks during troubled times:', '""Our results present a puzzle for asset pricing. They are consistent with quality stocks being underpriced and junk stocks overpriced or, alternatively, with quality stocks being riskier than junk stocks. However, while one can never rule out a risk explanation for the high return of quality stocks, we are unable to identify this risk; in anything, we find evidence of the opposite. We show that quality stocks are low beta and, rather than exhibiting crash risk, if anything they benefit from “flight to quality,” that is, they have a tendency to perform well during periods of extreme market distress. These findings present a challenge for risk-based explanations where bad states of the world are negatively correlated to extreme return realizations of the market factor. Finally, we show that the price of quality varies over time, generating a time-varying expected return on quality-minus-junk portfolios: a low price of quality predicts a high future return of quality stocks relative to junk stocks.""', 'Photo by Adam Nowakowski on Unsplash', 'Methodology', 'For this article we first listed down all holdings of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF with PE ratios less than 30 as of January 26.

Motley Fool Money starts now.', ""It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Dylan Lewis. Joining me over the airwaves, Motley Fool Senior Analysts, Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser. Gentlemen, great to have you both here. ... We've got updates on the state of investment banking, some curious snacks in foot long form, and of course stocks on our radar. But we are kicking off today with a stat that should have investors attention. Jason, according to the Wall Street Journal, there is 8.8 trillion with 80 trillion sitting in money market funds, CDs and other variants of cash. Why should we be watching this?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, I mean, I think we've been talking about over the past. It feels like, I guess the past 15 years really this idea that with interest rates always just running so low that the only real option out there for investors looking to make money was in the stock market, I mean, that played out in market valuations through the years. There weren't that many alternatives, and now that's changed a little bit with the interest rate policy doing what it's done. I mean, we're seeing now obviously mortgage rates through the roof, but the upside there is that it's giving investors another alternative, for a lower risk, a little bit more certainty in regard to returns there, and so these money market funds start to look more attractive, and you can see why funds would flow in there, at least temporarily or on a shorter term basis. That's fine. I think a lot of people may be look at investing in sort of this monolith. It's like these are your investing dollars and you're putting it all toward this goal which is usually retirement, and the way you do that is investing in the stock market. But the reality of the situation is that we all have a lot of different things we're trying to do with our money over the course of our lives, and so different strategies may come into play. But generally speaking, we, of course, like taking that long term view, hanging on to great businesses for long stretches of time. I think, when I see things like this, it makes me think about the dangers of getting in and out of the market based on something like an interest rate policy. It's OK if you're looking for a place to park your money. But all in all, if you're looking to make meaningful wealth, you need to stay invested. I mean, there's data out there that shows that Hartford funds and Morning Star data out there, if you missed the market's 10 best days over the past 30 years, your returns would have been cut in half and missing the best 30 days, your returns would have been reduced by 83%. It reminds me of that old Seinfeld episode, the car reservation bit. You remember that? You got to be able to hold the investment done. That's the key. Anybody can just buy them. I'm buying them here. You're buying them. Everybody's buy. You got to hold them. That's where the returns come from."", ""Matt Argersinger: I think a lot of the maybe the hidden point of the Wall Street Journal article and what investors are thinking is this adds a bit of a hedge to the market. If there's all this cash on the sidelines at some point, especially when rates fall, all this cash is going to run back in and it supports the stock market. I actually think it's going to be stickier this time around. Remember two big forces here. Rates were near zero for so long that you have a generation of investors, especially younger investors that have never earned anything on their savings. I mean, this is like a new thing. Then I think second, you've had the 2022 bear market, which was really hard. I think that's still fresh in a lot of investors' minds, particularly those on the older side maybe who are close to retirement or in retirement. Are they necessarily eager to jump back in the market? I think it's going to take a lot to get those investors off the sidelines. I think you'd almost have to see rates fall below 3% which would be quite a drop from here. It's a huge amount of cash. But I don't think we should look at it as some put on the market or a hedge on a sharp fall in the market. I don't think that money comes rushing back in."", ""Dylan Lewis: I don't think it's ever safe to bet against the inertia of doing nothing. I think it's pretty bankable that people are very happy to stay exactly where they are sometimes. But it's something worth paying attention to. If you're watching money flows, you may have also noticed that there are a lot of funds heading into the newly approved Bitcoin ETFs this month. Early in January, the SEC formally approved, while not actually endorsing or in any way endorsing, I should say, Bitcoin Spot ETFs, and some of the major firms have been quick to capitalize on those with what some folks are calling the Cointucky Derby. Matt Blackrocks, Bitcoin ETF, IBIT already has 1 billion in inflows. Fidelities, FBTC is close behind. Seems like this is good news for the big firms, probably good news for people that are eager to see more crypto adoption. Do you see any losers with this news?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I actually do, Dylan, I think, I don't know what this does to the price of Bitcoin long term, but I can tell you who these ETFs don't help, and that is exchanges or trading platforms like Coinbase or Robin Hood. These companies, especially coin base, they get some fees for being a custodian of Bitcoin for these ETFs. But now that Bitcoin can be passively bought and held by investors, especially institutions, I think it's going to hurt the trading volumes and margins for these companies."", ""Dylan Lewis: I'm not surprised. If you look at Coinbase, the stock is down almost 25% Since these ETF started trading about a week ago, it was the ultimate sell on the new signal. And I think there's more downside to come. Remember Coinbase and Robin Hood, they really make a lot of their trading based on the spreads for Bitcoin and other digital currencies. If I can now, especially with Blackrock and Fidelity invest in hold Bitcoin very cheaply over time. I don't need to trade it and I just think that could be a problem for these exchanges. I want to talk about this without necessarily having the Bitcoin thesis debate. We're going to put that on the side for a second. Just knowing that these are now exchange traded securities. Is there anything in particular you think investors ought to be paying attention to if they are considering these vehicles?"", ""Matt Argersinger: Well, again, I just think they're available, obviously we pay attention to the fees and they're very low in the case of Blackrock and Fidelity. That's what you want? I mean, previously I think to hold to try to have an investment in Bitcoin. You're looking at fees over 1% 1.5%. There were futures traded, there were a lot of hidden costs and big spreads in trading. Now that you can do this, great. But I also would caution against making these ETFs, any major part of your portfolio. I mean, it's essentially concentrated on one single commodity, and it is a commodity. They're cheap and they're passive. But don't let that trick you into thinking that all of a sudden all this money is going to start flowing a Bitcoin and it's a great long term investment. I think you still have to be diversified when thinking about them."", 'Dylan Lewis: With that out of the way, I think we can get to some of the spicier takes when it comes to crypto., and we heard some of them at the World Economic Forum and Davos this week. Jason, I believe one of the pre-eminent bankers had the things to say about the crypto industry.', ""Jason Moser: Who doesn't enjoy a good Bitcoin thesis debate. What I mean, come on. I honestly, I think that these ETFs are great in the sense that they bring transparency. They help bring transparency to an industry, to a market that needs it most. Regardless of your stance on Bitcoin and crypto, this is something I think that ultimately helps in that regard. But it is funny. I mean, in Davos, again. I mean, we see Jamie Diamond. One of the first questions he's asked in regard to crypto and Bitcoin, have you changed your mind? What your stance? It was funny to hear him being so short in regard to this time around. He's just like, listen, this is the last time I'm talking about this with you, so help me God, he's like, blockchain is real. It's a technology we use. But when you start getting into Bitcoin and crypto and things like that, maybe don't necessarily do something. At least in his perspective, they don't do anything. His advice is I don't want to get involved. But by the same token, he's like, I don't want to tell you what to do. I support your right, I defend your right to do Bitcoin if you want to do it. My personal advice would be not to get involved, but it's a free country. He really laid it out there and I'm going to be interested to see if this indeed is the last time because I just have a feeling it's not going to be because this is a space that is just, it's so filled with change. It's moving so fast. I feel like we're going to be we're going to be looking at a different set of rules almost here, maybe even a year from now."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, we saw headlines related to some of Diamond's comments at Davos. We also saw some headlines related to AI development, the geopolitical landscape. When you're looking at the event and some of the news that's come out of it, what are you paying attention to?"", ""Matt Argersinger: India made a pretty big splash at Davos this year. I think India has become the large emerging market of choice, now formally replacing China, which held this place on the mountaintop for so many years, and for one, India's population has recently surpassed China's. I mean, it's now the largest country with more than 1.4 billion people. That's like 18% of the world's population in one country. It's incredible. It's also gotten a much younger population. There was a report that was shared on CNBC that 33% a third of India's population is 20-33 years old. Right now, and this is data from Mckinsey and Goldman Sachs, only about 60 million people in India are considered affluent, meaning they earn at least $10,000 a year. That number could reach 100 million by 2027. Companies like Apple making a major push into the country for obvious reasons. But I think Starbucks could be an interesting bet on India. Starbucks is opening a new store in the country, like every three days, and right now they have just under 400 stores. Compare that to China, which actually has much less of a coffee culture than India. Starbucks has almost 7,000 stores there. They estimate they'll have 1,000 stores in India by 2028. I bet that ends up being way low, and so it's a massive potential market for Starbucks. I think it's a massive potential market for many US companies with global operations."", 'Dylan Lewis: Matt? I have to clarify this, because opening a Starbucks every three days could either be a hyperbolic joke or a true statistic. When it comes to a company like Starbucks, which one is it?', ""Matt Argersinger: It is absolutely a true statistic. At least as you believe Starbucks is management, which I'm not going to doubt, so pretty impressive."", ""Dylan Lewis: Love it. After the break, we've got some earnings from one of the most important companies in the world. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis, joined over the airwaves by Matt Argersinger and Jason Moser. The earnings results are rolling in and we're digging. Let's start with what I find myself constantly referring to as one of the most important, if not the most important, companies in the world, Matt. That is Taiwan Semiconductor, shares up 10% after the company reported this week. Safe to say, the market like the results."", ""Matt Argersinger: Absolutely, love the results. Don't underestimate a 10% move for the stock. It's a massively important company. Five hundred and sixty billion market cap, last I checked. It's added well over $50 billion this week since the earnings release alone. It wasn't about the four results, they were fine. But revenue was down, gross margin was lower, year over year. Earnings were sharply lower. That was all baked in already. I think what caught the market by surprise was just how bullish management was about the year. For one, they're expecting business to improve each quarter of 2024, which will ultimately lead to overall revenue growth in the low to mid 20% range. I don't think any or most investors were expecting that. As a result, utilization is going to go way up, margins are going to improve. Earnings should surge because there's just a ton of operating leverage in a business like this. I think you have to remember, I think most investors pride, they're excited about companies like Nvidia AMD, but these chip designers rely on Taiwan Semiconductors to manufacture their chips. That's where their production comes from. Without Taiwan Semiconductor, it just couldn't happen. As a demand for their chip surges, AI chip surge, so will the manufacturing needs for chips and TSM is the go-to source. I think it's also a bit of a tell on overall economic strength around the world in chip makers of all kinds. I'm not talking about just technology companies, but you've got auto manufacturers, appliance makers. If they're seeing higher demand, they're going to order more chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. If TSM thinks 2024 is going to be a strong year, it's probably a good bet a lot of industries are expecting a strong in 2024 as well. It could be a really positive signal for the overall economy."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, you mentioned the sheer size and scale of this business, and at over $500 billion, this company's almost back to all-time highs that it set a couple of years ago. It sounds like there's a very clear growth picture ahead. What expectations do investors need to have looking at this business?"", ""Matt Argersinger: Well, I would just say look at the expectations built into a lot of companies that rely on Taiwan Semiconductor. I mentioned in Nvidia AMD. Look at Intel's resurgence. It's not quite a proxy for a company like Taiwan Semiconductor, which doesn't make the same margins. But I have to say there should be a lot more enthusiasm about this company to the same degree about these other companies."", ""Dylan Lewis: Over to banking. Jason, this week, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley both gave us some updates and we got to see the market reaction on some of those updates as well. They are similar in what they do. Let's start with some of the higher-level trends. What is the state of deal-making and investment banking right now?"", ""Jason Moser: You've got Goldman and Morgan Stanley, both companies that really banks that focus more on the investment banking side of things. We saw with Goldman Asset and Wealth Management, revenue jumped 23% from a year ago. Great to see what was really impressive, I thought with Goldman was, earnings jump 51% from a year ago. This was a theme, but it was a theme of opposites in regard to these two banks. With Goldman, we saw them really benefiting from provision for credit losses coming down. To put that in context. The provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2023. This quarter just reported $577 million. That compares to $972 million from a year ago. A lot of money freeing up there. Over the course of the year, that number for 2023 is $1.03 billion, compared with 2.7, $2 billion from just a year ago. A lot of those provisions for credit loss is being released. No doubt some of that had to do with obviously what was a very good year for the market. But absolutely Goldman benefiting from those market conditions, which is good to see. It was interesting to see with Morgan Stanley though a little bit of the opposite. Their provisions were a little bit higher. They actually increased as the credit conditions for the commercial real estate sector really impacted Morgan Stanley. You see Ted picked the new CEO for the bank there. You think he's just approaching the year with a little more caution perhaps than the other bankers and maybe he's just trying to get his feet underneath them and get started with a note of humility there. But it was just interesting to see the juxtaposition there between Goldman with a little bit more of a glass-have-full view versus Morgan Stanley's, and maybe glass-half-full. [laughs]"", ""Dylan Lewis: Jason, I think we've all seen. We've all been able to observe the lack of new companies coming public, and maybe a little bit of a pause on some of the merger and acquisition activity that so many of these banks operate in. Do you feel like it's strong to see these types of results even while we know that those segments are a little weak?"", ""Jason Moser: I think it is. I think it's really encouraging. When you look at the way 2023 played out for investors, I don't know that it felt really as good as the actual returns showed us. I think the numbers were a lot better than maybe it felt. Maybe part of that has something to do with inflation and just the state of the consumer. But all in all, I think those market conditions improving. It does seem like we see these consumer sentiment numbers are getting us off to a good start here in 2024. There's a hunger out there for IPOs. There's a hunger out there for some new business to come online. I think we're going to see that in 2024, and these banks will definitely benefit from that."", ""Dylan Lewis: We'll wrap up our earnings run down with an update from Prologis. This is the largest industrial real estate investment trust in the world. Matt, when they speak, the entire shipping and storage world listens, what did they have to say this quarter?"", ""Matt Argersinger: That's totally right, Dylan. We talked about how big and how important Taiwan Semiconductor is for a lot of other companies. Prologis is hugely important for major companies like Amazon, eBay at Sea. UPS when it comes to shipping, logistics, inventory management. Prologis, the stock is actually up almost 30% in three months since they last reported, and that's quite a move in three months. But I think the results that came out this week really justify it. Same-store net operating income that's similar to same-store sales but for reads up 8.5% year over year. Average occupancy ended the year at 97.6%. That's near all-time high. Rent growth on new leases of 51%, really impressive. Management is really optimistic about the year. Just like Taiwan Semiconductors managers were. There's still a lot of supply concerns out there, but the heavy building is coming down. Development starts are way down. Capital markets are a lot calmer right now. They have an excellent balance sheet and the guidance they gave was really strong. They're targeting 9% growth in core funds from operations for the year. That's their cash flow metric. Stocks are a little expensive right now, but I think it deserves to trade it to premium. It's still 20% below. It's all-time high. Take a look at Prologis."", 'Dylan Lewis: Matt, when Jason was doing the rundown on the banks, he mentioned the reserve increases related to commercial real estate concerns. Is that something people need to be worried about with the storage space?', ""Matt Argersinger: Not at all. When it comes to industrial or self-storage. Just like Prologis, it's a totally different market. It doesn't have the same headwinds as office does right now."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt Argersinger, Jason Moser. Fellows, we'll see you a little bit later in the show. Up next, we've got a best-selling author weighing in on why the big banks are wrong, forcing people back into the office. Stay right here, you're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Back in December the Motley Fool had our annual company wide employee retreat, Foolapalooza. While we were together, the Motley Fool's Shannon Jones interviewed best selling author Dan Pink. While they were talking they took principles from his best and lesser known books and applied them to the modern topics of AI, employee motivation and what the modern office is really for in a hybrid world."", ""Shannon Jones: I want to start really on the topic of motivation because I think that's where it begins in your book drive. The surprising truth about what motivates us. You actually peel back the curtains, and so I'm curious what is it that really motivates us in the workplace?"", ""Daniel Pink: In the workplace, it's a mix of things and at some level we've gotten it wrong. I think the fool has gotten this much for years, and years and has gotten this much better than anybody else. But we have the idea out there in organizations that the way to motivate people is simply to dangle a reward in front of them. That if you dangle any prize, whether it's a raise, whether it's a bonus, whether it's a promotion, that people will do more and better work. It turns out that's just not true. The science tells us something very different. It tells us something that's a little bit nuanced. What it tells us is this, human beings are indeed motivated by money. But money in many cases is simply a threshold motivator and what really leads to enduring performance, especially on creative, complex tasks like all of you are doing, is a sense of autonomy. Do you have control over what you do, when you do it, where you do it, how you do it? Mastery. Are you making progress in meaningful work? Are you getting better at something that matter, and purpose. Do you know why you're doing something? Are you making a contribution internally or are you making a difference externally? Those are the things that really motivate us over the long haul and a lot of these contingent motivators are forms of control that give us a sugar, higher motivation. They get us moving very much in the short term, but they actually are not sustainable as real motivation. I think that world has been changing over time, but rather slowly."", ""Shannon Jones: Yeah. How has that changed now that we're in the post pandemic world? Has there been a change or a [inaudible]?"", ""Daniel Pink: I think there has been a change on something. Let's take the dimension of autonomy, for instance, and the Fool is a good example of that. I wrote a book 20 plus years ago called Free Agent Nation. My God, you're the guy who read it? [laughs]. Thank you. It's a book about the rise of people working for themselves. Truthfully, it remains in print today. It now sells tens of copies every year. One of the things I talked about in that book is that it's inevitable that we're going to have more people working at home. There's an affinity between work and home. That the separation, the distinct permanent, inexorable separation between work and home is really an historical artifact and that at a certain point, we're going to have people working at home a lot more than we ever had. We're going to have people working remotely. When I wrote that people said you're crazy, you don't know what you're talking about. We don't have the technology, you can't trust people. Cut 20 years later, a few hundred million people around the world did it in four days and sustained it for two years. Okay, we have any Ohioans here?"", ""All right, thank you. I'm going to use an Ohio expression here, which you can translate to your colleagues here, which is that's a very difficult egg to unscramble, right? You can't unscramble that egg, and so I think that in terms of autonomy, I think there's been a massive worldwide test case about whether you can trust people to be autonomous. I think the answer was a resounding yes, and I think you can't turn back from that. I think that's a big legacy of the pandemic and you see it now, I mean, I know that you guys have gone the other direction on remote work, but you see it now with the big banks for the last year and a half have been imploring their employees. You got to come back to work. You're not serious if you don't come back into the office, you have to be in the office five days a week. You got to come back. The talented people in response to that are saying, OK boomer, I'm going to find another job, and so I think that that is a big legacy of the pandemic. It's basically saying we can trust our default setting in organizations, should be like the Fools default setting. A default setting in work should be that most people are like us. You can trust them, they want to work hard, they want to do great work. We should start with that premise rather than the premise that begins a lot of these conversation, which is that people are shiftless, they're not trustworthy, they have to be watched, they have to be monitored. I think we're much better off beginning with the premise that applies to 95% of us and letting 5% of people disprove it, rather than the other premise which is essentially shackling 95% for the bad 5%."", 'Shannon Jones: Yeah. Well said Dan.', 'Daniel Pink: Thanks.', ""Shannon Jones: Yeah. I want to pull on that thread about working from home. We've obviously got a flexible work culture here. But I really want to get your thoughts on how do we create meaningful engagement at home. Now there are some tactical ways to optimize our work."", ""Daniel Pink: Yeah. I think that's a great question, Shannon and I think that's actually really hard. I think what's happening right now is you can think of it as a sorting out process that's happening now and we haven't figured it out. I think one of the big questions that we have to ask right now is what is an office for? For a long time, we knew what an office was for. An office was the place that house the equipment, that house the means of production that people needed to create wealth. It was also the place where you could talk to your colleagues. But now you know everybody has a supercomputer connected to the world in their pocket and you can slack, you can email, you can DM, you can text people instantly 24 hours a day, and so you have to ask, what is an office for? I don't think offices are going to disappear, but I think they have to be fundamentally rethought. That offices should probably be more like a cafe, or more like a nightclub, or more intentionally designed for collaboration and connection, and they should be compelling enough to lure people there rather than force people to go sit at a cubicle, 20 miles away from their home."", 'Shannon Jones: All right. Your other book, A Whole New Mind. The one of my favorites. You talked about how the future will actually be ruled by a different thinker, the right brain thinker. Tell us about that and what that means, especially in the realm of AI.', ""Daniel Pink: Okay, I'll take the two parts, so the argument of that book is that it used to be that the skills that got you into the middle class that made a difference in your ability to climb the ladder into the middle class, that allowed you to thrive within organizations were characteristic of the left hemisphere of the brain, logical, linear, sequential, analytical, spreadsheet, SAT abilities. The argument of that book, which came out 16 years ago or something like that, is that those metaphorically left brain abilities are necessary but they're no longer sufficient, and a different set of abilities. The ability is more characteristic of the right brain, artistry, empathy, inventiveness, big picture thinking. That those abilities now are the first among equals and that people who master those abilities on top of the left brain abilities are the ones who are going to thrive. Now, cut fade out, the second part of your question. That's the good news. Here's the bad news. I might be wrong. It could be because when I wrote that book there was not generative AI, and so for instance in that book I wrote about how the importance of empathy. Empathy is a great example and one of the ways that we empathize with others is that we read their tacit facial expressions and at the time software could barely could distinguish my face from yours. Let alone detect the emotion on that face, but now it can and there's some interesting studies that came out about a month ago showing that large language models actually demonstrated more empathy than physicians in certain circumstances, so I think that argument is right, but not as air tight as it was 18 months ago."", 'Janet Yellen: Yes, and how rapidly do you see that changing?', ""Daniel Pink: I don't know, man. The speed of the change is just really remarkable. Now, I don't think that AI is going to replace everybody's job in a wholesale way. I think that's not the way to think. I think that's contrary to what history has shown us. I think a way to think about it at an individual level is to think about AI as a partner and as a form of Co-Intelligence as another mind that you're collaborating with, and so this is cliche by now, but it basically people AI is not going to replace everybody, but humans with AI will replace humans who aren't using AI. The question then becomes how can you effectively use these new technologies? We've seen this movie before. We've collaborated with other technologies. I'm old enough to remember like not the advent of calculators in classrooms, but the early days of calculators in classrooms and there was alarm then, no one is ever going to learn math and the same thing is with search engines no one is ever going to learn how to do research and now we have that same alarm here. I think you have to look at AI as a form of Co-Intelligence as a partner, as a collaborator or something to augment your skill and I do think that it calls on some really interesting new skills though."", ""Janet Yellen: Yeah. What you're saying then is the level playing field, is there for right and left brain?"", ""Daniel Pink: Well, I think you make a good point Janet because one of the things that the early research on AI has shown is that AI does an incredible job of bringing up the bottom performers. It brings up the bottom performers significantly. It doesn't have as much of an effect on the people at the top performers, but there's some interesting research on law and law students and particularly something even like legal writing that AI can help take people, let's say we have a distribution of legal writers and AI is going to have no effect on people in the 90th percentile of legal writers. But those in like the 10th percentile, the 20th percentile, the 30th percentile they're going to get a lot better. They're going to become essentially what are now 60th percentile writers. Thanks to AI, so the early effect on AI is that it actually lifts up the bottom considerably. You see that in research on lawyering, you see that in research on customer service. It's pretty remarkable."", ""Dylan Lewis: Listeners, you can catch the latest thinking from Dan Pink on X.

Jason, do you think you could possibly eat a foot long cookie?"", ""Jason Moser: If I had to sure, I don't know that that qualifies as a side kick like that sounds like it's all good on its own. I like cookies, but I feel like the love of diminishing returns kicks in at some point with this thing. [laughs]"", ""Dylan Lewis: I like that you said if I had to because this is ideally a product that they are looking to sell and that people want to eat, but it's more of a food challenge. It sounds like to me. Matt, I'm curious. The company is reportedly seeing some interest on college campuses, do you feel like this is a late night munchie play or is there actually a market here for this product?"", ""Matt Argersinger: No, there is. There absolutely. It's been hung over otherwise and debreated young people very late night. I can see this being a bit of a hit. I just have one question. How many calories are in this foot long chocolate chip cookie? [laughs] What's the guess there?

I think you're good with just the side kick cookie. Let's get over two stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question. Matt, you're up first, what are you looking at this week?"", ""Matt Argersinger: I'm going with RPM International. No, it is not a car racing stock. It's much more exciting than that actually RPM stands for Republic Powdered Metals. This is a company involved in very exciting businesses like concrete additives, waterproofing, roof coating, paint removal, corrosion protection, sealants and Cox. If you've ever renovated a house or redone a kitchen or bathroom I promise you that you or your contractor have used some probably many of RPM's products. One of the most popular brands is Rustoleum. I've been feeling Dan is a power user of stoleum. I don't know why I feel that, but anyway family run business, it's delivered incredible returns to shareholders. It's consolidated this highly fragmented market and built out a pretty good distribution footprint. Has a lot of cost advantages. Operating earnings are expected to grow in the load mid single digits over the next few years and most exciting guys it is a recently crowned dividend king meaning it's raised its dividend for 50 consecutive years and management loves to talk about the dividend. As you guys know I love boring companies that pay and grow dividends. I'm happy to watch paint dry if I know I'm getting a regular dividend check and I think RPM is one to look at."", ""Dylan Lewis: Dan, I know you are a frequent visitor of the hardware store and Home Depot, RPM International sounds like hardware store company, is this one you're interested in?"", ""Daniel Pink: Yeah, so I was ready to lampoon Matty for bringing yet another boring company to talk about, but he had me at Rustoleum. Rustoleum is a very good brand with excellent products, so I've got nothing bad to say about this company."", ""Dylan Lewis: Everyone knows the classic ROM com blind. You had me at Rustoleum. Jason, what's on your radar this week?"", ""Jason Moser: Matty has put me behind the eight ball here. I've been looking more into a company called Globus Medical, reticulous is GMED. The word musculoskeletal, a big word it refers to the human locomotor system. How we move around it includes all the muscles, the bones, joints, the connective tissue that helps us move our bodies and did you know there are over 150 different diseases and conditions that can impair our musculoskeletal system resulting in pain, limited movement more and you know what they'll I bet you plowing down one of those subway foot long cookies at that you're going to have trouble moving around. This might be maybe there's an advertising campaign that could go along with Subway here, but Globus Medical is a company. They're devoted to developing the solutions for these musculoskeletal disorders through devices, surgical equipment, monitoring and technologies. It's actually a very big market. Health care represents a large market opportunity and in regard to Globus, this is a $50 billion overall market when you include spine orthopaedics, the enabling technology and the tools that they all use. The co-founder and chairman, David Paul, still actually owns 16% of the company. I think interestingly, they just closed on an acquisition a company called Nuvasive. Right at the end of 2023 they bought Nuvasive as for just a little bit more than three billion dollars in an all stock deal and it really does combine these two companies together, some complimentary portfolios of offerings to really focus as the leader in that musculoskeletal market. I love finding big dogs in the space there. This certainly seems like one of those big dogs in a market that doesn't look like it's headed anywhere any time soon."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Globus Medical and can you say musculoskeletal three times fast?', ""Daniel Pink: I'm not even going to bother with that, Dylan. I am going to ask Jason because you're getting up there in years now Mr. Moser. Globus Medical is going to give you a free joint replacement, where are you going with that?"", ""Jason Moser: I'll tell you what. I feel like I'm going to have to go with the hip that stands out to me as the one that probably is going to go first play, a lot of golf throughout my life, Dan that I've been rotating around those hips for a lot of years."", ""Dylan Lewis: Dan, which one's going on your watch list this week?"", ""Daniel Pink: No surprise to anyone but I'm going to go RPM.

The average gross annual wage per full-time employee in the USA was $74,738 in 2021, or around $6,228 per month.\xa0"", 'Moreover, the average salary in the US is $59,428 annually whereas the per capita income in the United States over the past 12 months, adjusted for inflation to 2022 dollars, was $41,261.

Additionally, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) will offer a bonus of up to 200% of base pay to store managers.\xa0', 'Approximately 75% of Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)’s field management teams, like store managers, began their careers in hourly roles. The salary adjustments will impact managers across different pay ranges, with those at the lowest end seeing the largest increases, from $65,000 to $90,000, while those at the top end will remain at $170,000. The changes in pay align with Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) ongoing efforts to increase starting wages, bringing the US average hourly wage to over $18 soon. These adjustments could potentially enhance Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) recruitment and retention strategies in the competitive job market.', ""In 2023, the US economy exhibited unexpected strength by adding 216,000 jobs, surpassing economists' forecast of 175,000. However, this positive momentum was tempered by downward revisions of 70,000 to job gains in October and November.

Notably, wage-growth did accelerate, with average hourly pay rising to $34.27 and a yearly increase of 4.1%, slightly above the Fed's target. However, the labor force participation rate declined to 62.5%, marking the biggest drop in nearly three years, potentially complicating the Fed's task of managing inflation. As the job market is anticipated to cool further in 2024, the rise in wage growth and decrease in participation may influence the Federal Reserve to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period."", ""Speaking of wage growth, Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) has announced major benefits for its hourly employees in 2024, with a minimum 3% pay raise (4-5% based on tenure), scheduling improvements, and career mobility opportunities.

These stocks provide investors with a reliable and steadily growing income over time. Additionally, they have demonstrated resilience during economic challenges. As per a Hartford Funds report, companies that have increased or introduced dividends have consistently outperformed other stocks since 1973, especially when compared to those that reduced or eliminated their dividends. Notably, these dividend-paying stocks have exhibited higher returns with considerably lower volatility. This is why many financial experts are currently emphasizing the advantages of integrating dividend-paying stocks as a fundamental component of an equity portfolio when advising their clients.', 'A key driver behind the trend of companies initiating dividends lies in the aftermath of the financial crisis, where corporations experienced a surge in profits, leading to substantial growth in their balance sheets. Since the early 2000s, the cash reserves on corporate balance sheets have more than tripled. This surplus of cash provides corporations with versatile options, including expanding their operations or engaging in acquisitions. A notable choice for many companies has been to deploy the excess cash by either initiating a dividend program or augmenting existing dividend payouts. This strategic use of accumulated funds reflects a proactive approach by companies to enhance shareholder value and leverage their financial strength for sustained growth.', 'Two promising factors for dividend investors are the combination of strong corporate profits among S&P 500 companies and remarkably low payout ratios. According to a report by Hartford Funds, the historical average dividend payout ratio spanning 96 years has been 56.3%. However, as of December 31, 2022, the current payout ratio stands at a mere 37.1%, signifying a substantial gap with ample room for expansion. This presents a promising scenario for dividend investors, as companies appear to have considerable capacity to increase their dividend payouts, potentially leading to enhanced returns for investors in the foreseeable future.', ""In 2023, dividend stocks faced a period of underperformance as yields experienced a significant increase, primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate hikes. However, the outlook for income investing is anticipated to undergo a shift in 2024. With growing expectations for the Federal Reserve to either pause the rate hikes or potentially implement a cut, the dynamics of income investing are poised for a potential transformation. Portfolio Manager John Baldi, overseeing the ClearBridge Dividend Strategy, has expressed an optimistic perspective on dividend stocks for the year 2024. Here are some comments from the analyst:"", '“As a general overall market observation, the macro is highly unpredictable. We entered 2023 with expectations for a recession that was going to start in the back half of this year. We’ve just reported one of the strongest quarters of growth in the recent past. With highly unpredictable macro as a backdrop, I think it’s important to maintain equity exposure.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global seafood market and sustainability in the seafood industry, and go directly to Top 5 Largest Seafood Companies in the World.', 'Over three billion people worldwide depend on fish and other seafood products for vital nutrients, and the fishing and seafood sectors employ between 10–12% of the global workforce. The seafood industry is an integral economic generator as seen in the United States, bringing in over $200 billion in revenue each year, with imports accounting for over twice as much as exports. According to NOAA, approximately 2.4 billion pounds of seafood were exported from the United States in 2020, whereas 6.1 billion pounds of seafood from other countries ended up on American plates. Commercial farming, processing, retail, and harvesting of marine food sources are substantial assets for the regional and local economies.', 'The size of the global market for seafood was $310.75 billion in 2021, and it is expected to rise from $333.25 billion in 2022 to $605.46 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 8.92% during the forecast period. The primary growth factors fueling this industry are - the rising demand for seafood that has been processed or is ready to cook, the increasing inclination toward pescetarianism adoption, etc.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic was exceptional and startling for the seafood sector, with demand for seafood exceeding expectations in every region when compared to pre-pandemic levels. The data indicates that in 2020, the market expanded by 12.34% compared to 2019.', ""Seafood that is considered sustainable is defined as having been fished in the wild or farmed and harvested in a way that safeguards the ocean's biodiversity and the health of the local ecosystem, communities, and wildlife, preventing the extinction of marine life.\xa0"", 'Having a less negative impact on the ecosystem, aquaculture (fish farms) has proven beneficial over wild-caught seafood. This is demonstrated by the growing proportion of farmed aquatic creatures that are fed directly to humans—about 50% at the moment. However, aquaculture can have fatal results if it is poorly planned or maintained. Neighboring rivers, lakes, and other water sources can become destroyed by disease and pollution that leaks from fish farms. Fisheries can effectively remove fish waste and stop it from entering nearby waters by using appropriate filtration or fishing systems walled off to surrounding ecosystems.', 'Despite paying close attention to unsustainable practices like overfishing, the unintentional capture of marine life in fishing nets, water pollution from poorly managed fish farms, and the use of wild fish as food for farmed fish, sustainable fishing demands environmental and economic justice for the communities that depend on the fishing industry. Improved technical advancements, such as electronic monitoring devices installed on boats, hold the potential to provide the information required by regulatory agencies and scientists to assess the effectiveness of sustainable fishing methods.\xa0', 'Illegal fishing, which may account for up to 30% of the capture of high-value species, is closely linked to overfishing. Tens of billions of dollars are transferred through untraceable supply chains by this widespread practice, which is damaging to the environment and financially detrimental to legitimately operated fisheries. Future technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), may make it easier to detect and trace the path of seafood which often travels abroad for processing before returning to the US.', 'The ecological impact of seafood is also influenced by the size of the fishing operation. Since 2012, aquaculture has surpassed the capturing of seafood from natural sources. The U.S. agency responsible for protecting and managing marine and coastal ecosystems, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, stated in a 2022 report that the populations of the most overfished species had fallen to an all-time low in 2017.\xa0', ""Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) is a giant seafood wholesaler in the United States with over ten years of experience in sustainability. Since 2009, the company’s commitment to seafood has resulted in the acquisition of approximately 700 million pounds of more sustainably farmed seafood and has altered the global footprint of the food service sector with regard to ocean health. By the end of 2019, 79% of Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY)’s top 5 farmed species and 99% of the company's top 15 wild-caught species were sourced from more sustainable sources."", 'With great enthusiasm, Sysco and WWF announce a renewed collaboration to source seafood more sustainably, as well as their seafood sustainability commitments for 2025. The new pledges expand on previous achievements and strengthen the Houston-based company’s standing as a world authority on sustainable seafood, set high benchmarks for the seafood sector, create long-term sustainability objectives, and foster customer confidence.

While it operates in the sleepy utility sector, it's anything but lethargic. It has delivered peer-leading earnings growth over the last decade, beating the industry average by a wide margin. "", 'Even though NextEra is already one of the largest utilities in the country, it expects to continue growing at an above-average pace. That makes it a great option for those seeking outsized returns from this sleepy sector.', 'NextEra Energy\'s CEO, John Ketchum, highlighted the company\'s outperformance compared to its peers on the fourth-quarter conference call. He pointed out, ""Over the past 10 years, we have delivered compound annual growth in adjusted EPS (earnings per share) of roughly 10%, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies. Over that same period, the remaining top 10 power companies have achieved, on average, compound annual growth in adjusted EPS of roughly 2%."" ', ""NextEra Energy has grown at a blistering rate for a utility. Several factors have helped power its ability to grow much faster than its peers. Geography is a big driver. The company's electric utility, Florida Power & Light (FPL), operates in one of the fastest-growing states, so it benefits from strong customer growth (FPL added 81,000 customers during the fourth quarter). Florida also benefits from abundant sunshine. That's enabling the company to build lots of low-cost solar energy capacity. It added 1.2 gigawatts (GW) last year and plans to add another 4.8 GW over the next few years. "", ""Another big growth driver for NextEra is its energy resources segment. The company owns a growing portfolio of energy infrastructure assets (e.g., power plants, gas pipelines, and electricity transmission lines) that support other utilities and end users. This segment provides the company with additional growth drivers. For example, it placed 5.6 GW of new wind, solar, and storage projects into service last year. Those projects helped increase this segment's adjusted earnings by nearly 13%. "", 'NextEra Energy fully expects to continue growing at a strong rate in the coming years. It anticipates that FPL will continue benefiting from Florida\'s abundant sun and outsized population growth. Ketchum stated on the fourth-quarter call that ""by 2032, we expect to increase FPL solar from 5% of our total generation today to roughly 35% by adding over 15,000 incremental megawatts."" On top of that, the company continues ""to believe FPL is strategically well positioned as Florida remains one of the fastest-growing states in the U.S. with a population growth that is expected to roughly double the national average through 2030. Florida\'s economy is also growing and is now the 14th largest in the world if Florida were a country."" ', 'Meanwhile, the company\'s energy resources segment continues to grow briskly as it capitalizes on opportunities to support the country\'s accelerating renewable energy demand. NextEra had a record year for originating new investments in 2023, adding about 9 GW to its backlog, which now stands at over 20 GW. Ketchum noted, ""Energy resources continues to see strong demand and is well positioned to realize its development expectations over the four-year period ending 2026. Assuming we achieve the midpoint of the range, Energy Resources will be operating a roughly 63-gigawatt renewable portfolio by the end of 2026 that would be larger than the installed renewables capacity of all but nine countries."" The company also added a record amount of transmission projects last year, boosting that backlog to $1.9 billion of capital investments through 2027.', 'These catalysts drive the company\'s view that it can continue growing its earnings briskly. While it expects its earnings growth rate to slow to around 5% at the mid-point of its guidance range this year, it sees a reacceleration in 2025 and 2026 of 6% to 8% annual growth from this year\'s range. However, that could prove conservative. Ketchum commented in the fourth-quarter earnings release that ""Given the strength of both businesses, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each year through 2026, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings."" ', ""For context, the company's outlook suggests it will grow faster than most rivals. For example, Duke Energy expects to deliver long-term earnings growth of 5% to 7% annually through 2027. That's also Xcel Energy's long-term earnings growth target range. "", 'NextEra Energy has grown much faster than its rivals over the past few years, thanks to its focus on Florida and renewable energy. Those two catalysts should continue to power above-average growth.

The Nutrition unit accounted for just 9.3% of ADM revenue that year, LSEG data showed. ADM in 2023 reported average Nutrition operating profit growth from 2020 to 2022 of a larger-than-forecast 21.4% and which topped the company\'s average adjusted return on invested capital target. As a result, seven ADM executives were awarded more than 841,000 performance share units, twice the targeted payout, the proxy statements showed.

The iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF gained 29% in 2023, beating the S&P 500 returns of 24%. The rise of Magnificent Seven stocks like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and\xa0 Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a sign of the market\'s concentration in quality as investors flocked to companies with strong balance sheets and fundamentals. But what exactly are quality stocks? Billionaire Cliff Asness, Andrea Frazzini, and Lasse H. Pedersen wrote a research paper in 2013 titled ""Quality Minus Junk"" in which they defined quality stocks as follows:', '""We define a quality security as one that has characteristics that, all-else-equal, an investor should be willing to pay a higher price for: stocks that are safe, profitable, growing, and well managed. High quality stocks do have higher prices on average, but not by a very large margin. Perhaps because of this puzzlingly modest impact of quality on price, high-quality stocks have high risk-adjusted returns. Indeed, a quality-minus-junk (QMJ) factor that goes long high-quality stocks and shorts low-quality stocks earns significant risk-adjusted returns in the U.S. and globally across 24 countries. The price of quality – i.e., how much investors pay extra for higher quality stocks – varies over time, reaching a low during the internet bubble.""', 'While the market is expecting rate cuts this year, rising geopolitical tensions and a persistent inflation is keeping the demand for quality stocks higher. Almost all notable investment firms including Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs recommended investors to buy high quality names for 2024. Why? \xa0High-quality stocks tend to perform better when growth is slowing down. A latest Wall Street Journal report quoted data from UBS which said the MSCI ACWI Quality Index has beaten the MSCI’s global index by 1 percentage point over six-month periods in which the economic growth slowed.', 'The research paper from Cliff Asness we mentioned earlier also talked about the returns of quality stocks during troubled times:', '""Our results present a puzzle for asset pricing. They are consistent with quality stocks being underpriced and junk stocks overpriced or, alternatively, with quality stocks being riskier than junk stocks. However, while one can never rule out a risk explanation for the high return of quality stocks, we are unable to identify this risk; in anything, we find evidence of the opposite. We show that quality stocks are low beta and, rather than exhibiting crash risk, if anything they benefit from “flight to quality,” that is, they have a tendency to perform well during periods of extreme market distress. These findings present a challenge for risk-based explanations where bad states of the world are negatively correlated to extreme return realizations of the market factor. Finally, we show that the price of quality varies over time, generating a time-varying expected return on quality-minus-junk portfolios: a low price of quality predicts a high future return of quality stocks relative to junk stocks.""', 'Photo by Adam Nowakowski on Unsplash', 'Methodology', 'For this article we first listed down all holdings of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF with PE ratios less than 30 as of January 26.

Against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, oil prices surged, driving gains in energy-related stocks. The Stoxx 600 index in Europe remained steady, hovering close to its highest level since January 2022, buoyed by robust performances from energy sectors. Meanwhile, futures contracts for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 exhibited stability. Across Asian markets, stocks saw upward momentum fueled by optimism surrounding China's latest efforts to fortify its equity market. As the week unfolds, market participants remain attuned to developments from central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, seeking insights into their rate policy decisions. Additionally, eyes are on an influx of earnings reports, shaping expectations and influencing trading sentiments. Amidst this cautious sentiment, oil prices remain a focal point, driven by geopolitical tensions that could potentially disrupt supply chains and impact global economic dynamics.

The court's judgment, which follows more than two years of Evergrande's inability to present a viable restructuring plan after defaulting on a bond repayment, is poised to reverberate through China's already fragile financial markets. According to Reuters, despite the liquidation order, Evergrande's chief executive Siu Shawn assured continuity in the company's home construction projects. Tiffany Wong, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing a structured approach to preserve value for creditors and stakeholders. The decision sets the stage for a protracted and intricate process, compounded by potential political implications, particularly regarding the recognition of Hong Kong's ruling by Chinese courts. Investors, particularly offshore stakeholders, are keenly observing how foreign creditors will be treated in the event of a corporate collapse. The ruling has immediate ramifications, with Evergrande's shares plunging by as much as 20% before trading was halted. The company's listed subsidiaries, including China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group and Evergrande Property Services, also saw trading suspended after the court's verdict. Given Evergrande's substantial assets and liabilities, estimated at over $300 billion, its liquidation adds further pressure to China's struggling property and financial markets. With Beijing already grappling with economic challenges and a sluggish property market, the ruling compounds existing concerns about investor confidence and growth prospects. The court's decision underscores the severity of Evergrande's financial woes and the urgency of addressing systemic issues within China's property sector.

The company just reported its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023, and it added 13.1 million subscribers, a record for the period."", ""Netflix now has over 260 million subscribers, which is significantly more than any of its competitors -- it's a whopping 110 million more than Disney's flagship Disney+ service, which is consistently a top-three streaming provider."", ""Below, I'll explain how the record result came about and discuss five things smart investors learned from the fourth-quarter report."", ""Netflix battled with its account-sharing issue for years. Subscribers would often lend their password to friends and family members, which meant 100 million households around the world were using Netflix completely free of charge (according to the company's estimates)."", ""In mid-2022, Netflix lost subscribers for the first time in 10 years, which prompted a crackdown on password sharing. Now, a subscriber's account will no longer work outside of their household. Instead, those on the standard ($15.49 per month) plan can add one extra member outside of their household for just $7.99 per month. Subscribers on the premium ($22.99 per month) plan can add two extra members for $7.99 per month each."", ""So, while the additional members are paying far less than full price for their subscription, it's better than nothing. This strategy was a key part of the company's huge subscriber increase in Q4."", 'In the quarterly shareholder letter, management said, ""We believe we\'ve successfully addressed account sharing,"" and it could help Netflix further penetrate its addressable market of 500 million connected TV households more effectively.', 'Besides forcing password sharers to pay, Netflix is trying to attract new users by offering a cheaper ad-supported subscription tier. The company launched it at the end of 2022 with a price point of $6.99 per month, and it has already amassed 23 million monthly active users. In fact, the ad tier is responsible for 40% of all new sign-ups (in markets where the ad tier is active).', ""The economics of advertising require scale to work. In other words, businesses won't spend their marketing dollars on a streaming platform with a small user base. They want to reach millions of viewers to increase their chance of a positive return on their investment."", ""Netflix's ad tier might be reaching that point, and in the middle of last year, management said it's already bringing in as much revenue per user as the $15.49-per-month standard tier. That implies Netflix is generating more than $8 in advertising revenue per user, per month, on top of the $6.99 subscription fee."", 'The company has only scratched the surface of its opportunity. It says there is $25 billion spent on connected TV ads every year, and considering Netflix accounts for less than 10% of the time people spend watching TV, there is plenty of room to grow.', ""The key to bringing in more advertising dollars is keeping users engaged with more content. Netflix plans to spend a whopping $17 billion on producing and licensing movies and TV shows this year, which is near a record high. Meanwhile, competitors are slashing their budgets as they struggle to match Netflix's scale and profitability. Last year, Disney revealed plans to cut around $4.5 billion from its content budget going forward."", ""With its competitors adopting a defensive stance, 2024 is a great time for Netflix to get aggressive and exert maximum pressure. The company is launching new seasons of smash-hit TV shows Bridgerton, Squid Game, and Formula 1: Drive to Survive. It's also releasing new shows featuring megastars like Sofia Vergara and Benedict Cumberbatch, as well as a series from the showrunners responsible for Game of Thrones."", ""Subscribers can also look forward to a number of exciting movies, including Eddie Murphy's return in Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F."", 'But Netflix made headlines recently\xa0when it announced a deal with TKO Group Holdings\xa0to acquire the global rights to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Netflix will stream WWE Raw live every week in all major markets around the world. Outside the U.S., it will also show Smackdown and NXT, plus one-off live events like WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Royal Rumble.', ""Reports suggest the deal is worth $5 billion over 10 years (to begin in Jan. 2025), and it's a milestone in Netflix's pursuit to deliver more live programming."", ""Given so much of Netflix's subscriber growth is coming from cheaper options like the ad tier and sharing offer, the company's revenue growth has been muted over the past year. For example, in Q2 2023, Netflix delivered an 8.0% year-over-year increase in subscribers but only a 2.7% uptick in revenue."", 'That gap has been closing. In Q4, subscribers grew 12.8% and revenue rose 12.5%, marking the fastest quarterly revenue increase in two years. There are a few reasons for that.', ""First, Netflix increased the price of its premium tier by $3 near the end of last year, so it's now pulling in more revenue from those subscribers. Second, Netflix eliminated its $9.99-per-month basic plan, so users seeking the cheapest option will have to go with the ad tier. As I mentioned earlier, the ad tier generates as much revenue per user as the standard tier, so while the user pays less, Netflix makes more."", 'Finally, the company should generate a growing amount of advertising revenue as more members sign up for the ad tier, making it more lucrative per user over time as it scales.', ""In its Q4 call with investors, management hinted more price hikes could be coming in the near future, so Netflix's revenue acceleration still has legs."", ""Netflix's Q4 results received a warm reception from investors, and its stock has jumped 16% since they were reported. Based on the company's $12.01 in earnings per share for full-year 2023 and a stock price of about $570, Netflix trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 47."", ""That's more than double the 22 P/E ratio of the S&P 500 index, and it's also more expensive than the 31 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100. In that context, Netflix stock doesn't look very attractive."", ""However, traditional valuation metrics aren't always a good indicator of whether you should buy a stock. Netflix has delivered a staggering return of 46,890% since it went public in 2002, and its 47 P/E is much closer to its cheapest-ever level than its most expensive."", ""In fact, Netflix hasn't always been profitable, so the P/E ratio wasn't even applicable during certain periods. If you avoided the stock purely because it wasn't trading at a cheap valuation relative to the broad market, you would have missed the chance to earn incredible returns."", ""With that in mind, Netflix stock is worth owning for the long term because of the company's growing dominance in the streaming industry. Its pricing power will increase as its competitors continue to sputter, and its content catalog will only expand as more media companies have little choice but to license their shows and movies to the world's biggest platform."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Netflix wasn't one of them.

If you want to skip our take on the market as the new year officially begins, then you can take a look at the top five stocks in this list by clicking 5 Best Performing Growth Stocks in January 2024. ', ""\xa0The start of 2024 shows that even the best of forecast and the most capable of analysts can sometimes be wrong. The first month of the new year is full of news about economic data that is setting the tone for markets and the economy for the rest of 2024. 2024 is an important year, not only because it should see interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, but also because it's election year in the U.S. Elections in America affect not only Americans, as has been evident by the charged environment of recent years, but also the world since decisions made in Washington have global effects. "", 'Last year had started out with investors worrying that rapid and significant interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve would sap economic activity and tip America into a recession. However, the economic data for the fourth quarter shows that the U.S. GDP grew by 3.3% - which is far, far away from a recession and mouth watering when we consider the economic troubles of powerhouses such as Germany and China. Not only did the economy grow by 3.3% in Q4, but for the full year, growth sat at a respectable 2.5%.', ""However, while economic growth is always welcomed by politicians, given the current market climate, for investors it paints a more complicated picture. This is because while a growing economy is beneficial for businesses and the stock markets, these days it also means that the Fed might be able to keep rates higher for longer. A key balance that Fed officials have to strike now that they've avoided a recession in 2023 is to start reducing rates before it's too late and keep them high enough for just the right time to make sure that inflation does not increase."", 'Overall, the economy influences investor perceptions about stocks and their future. Stocks are broadly divided into two categories, namely value stocks and growth stocks. Value stocks are those that are reasonably priced with respect to their earnings per share. These are stocks that belong to stable companies with consistent markets that are able to buffer drops in spending power during an economic downturn.', ""On the other end are growth stocks. These belong to companies that are operating in markets with untapped potential for revenue. The market, sensing this, prices the shares higher with respect to their earnings, and the resulting differential is captured through a price to earnings ratio. The higher this ratio (which uses either the latest twelve month, fiscal year, or forecast/estimated earnings), the more optimistic investors are about the stock's ability to grow in the future."", 'As it might also sound intuitive, growth stocks do well when people and businesses have money to spend. This is influenced by the economy and interest rates, both of which influence the ease with which money is available for spending. Therefore, when access to capital is cheap, there is more spending, and high growth industries such as technology end up benefiting as a result.', ""In fact, picking out the right growth stocks at the right time can often provide an investor with the potential to double or even triple their money. As an illustration, consider the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA's shares are up by a whopping 1,500%+ over the past five years. So, if you'd bought $100 of stock in January 2019 - less than a year before the pandemic struck - then your small investment would be worth roughly $1,700 now. That's a big gain, and a $10,000 investment would have meant a profit of $160,000 in just five years - or equivalent to the combined average starting salary for a Master's graduate in the U.S. for two years."", ""NVIDIA became the growth stock in 2023 as investors realized the massive potential offered by its products to train mathematical models\xa0 commonly known as artificial intelligence. A.I. is a part of the public imagination now, and since it relies on making inferences or predictions using data, its use cases are quite ubiquitous as well. Whether it's medical science, fraud detection, drug research, logistics, shipping, or even writing, A.I. models carry with them the advantage of having a treasure trove of data to use and inform decision making."", ""Couple the investor interest in A.I. with the rosier economic conditions we're seeing at the start of 2024 and one might even start to think that growth stocks could do nothing else but grow this year. One way to see which growth stocks are worth their salt is to see their performance in 2024 so far in response to the shifting economic environment. Today we've done just this and the top growth stocks of January 2024 are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX).

We have also discussed the state of US labor market. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the Top 5 Industries That are Hiring Right Now.', ""In 2024, the US labor market is expected to show signs of stabilization after a tumultuous 2023. The unemployment rate, which reached 3.7% in November of 2023 is on a positive trajectory, and the Fed is considering interest-rate cuts. Despite concerns of a recession, the economy is defying expectations with a soft landing. Wages are anticipated to slow down, returning to pre-pandemic levels. While wages posted on Indeed were up 4.2% in October, it marks a decline from July's peak of 4.8% and January 2022's 9.3%. Merit increases are also expected to slow, with employers predicting a 3.5% rise in 2024, slightly below 2023 levels."", 'Hiring, while slowing, still holds promise, with 57% of managers expressing plans to increase permanent roles in the first half of 2024. The job market is forecasted to slow down further, making the present a relatively favorable time for job transitions. Layoffs, though unpredictable, are expected to remain low in 2024, standing at 41% lower than November 2022. However, there is a cautious note that a sudden increase to a more recessionary level could occur if the US slips into a downturn. Despite challenges, there is a prevailing optimism among employers towards 2024, with a focus on rightsizing and steady growth.', ""According to a recent analysis by career site Indeed, some companies in the US are hiring at a faster pace than others. Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG) topped the list with a relative hire rate of 2.29, making it the fastest in terms of hiring among the companies analyzed. Mariano's followed closely with a rate of 2.06, securing the second position. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranked at No. 8 with a relative hire rate of 1.68. The analysis focused on the period from August 1 to the end of October, and the companies on the list are still actively hiring.\xa0"", 'It is also worth highlighting that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s hiring will not be limited to the US alone. In fact, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is reportedly expanding its operations in Sweden by posting seven job openings for metal workers, painters, and claims adjusters at its Stockholm factory, despite ongoing sympathy strikes in the region. The conflict began when Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) mechanics in Sweden signed with the labor union IF Metall, but negotiations broke down as Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) refused to sign a collective agreement. Affiliated unions launched sympathy strikes affecting different aspects of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) business. The decision to hire nonunion workers suggests Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) commitment to its anti-union stance, potentially impacting US workers, who are the primary target of United Auto Workers leadership.', ""Speaking of Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG), their recent acquisition of SJR National Retail for $6 million may seem like a minor move, but it holds major implications for the jewelry retail industry. Despite a decline of 8.1% in Q2 revenues and a 12% drop in same-store sales, Signet's stock rose from $71 to almost $80 after surpassing analysts' estimates. The company maintained its year-end guidance with sales projected at $7.1 to $7.3 billion and an operating income between $635 million to $675 million.\xa0"", 'Notably, Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG)’s acquisition of SJR National Retail, a full-service jewelry and watch repair company, opened doors for business-to-business repair services to independent jewelers.

Revenue and membership growth decelerated rapidly in 2022 and eventually hit low-single-digit levels. Also weighed down by a sell-off in tech stocks, the stock cratered, falling more than 50% in 2022. However, as Netflix started rolling out its advertising business and began cracking down on users who accessed the service without paying by logging into someone else's account, the narrative quickly turned positive.

Over this same time frame, earnings per share increased from $0.12 to $2.11, paid memberships rose from 231 million to 260 million, and quarterly free cash flow soared from $332 million to nearly $1.6 billion.

This huge increase in earnings is expected to come from further operating margin expansion."", ""Looking even further out, Netflix's fast-growing but still small advertising business should start having a material impact on the company's business by next year.

Further, this new segment's growth has been astounding, growing 70% quarter over quarter in Q4 -- and that's on top of 70% quarter-over-quarter growth in the prior period."", ""Considering Netflix's impressive business momentum, the stock's recent surge higher seems to be justified. Sure, shares may look expensive at first glance given the stock's current price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 45. But strong top-line momentum and an expanding operating margin could lead the company's earnings per share to soar in 2024. This would quickly bring down the stock's P/E to a more attractive level.

The reported 10-year, $5 billion-plus agreement will bring the popular weekly professional wrestling show to the streaming giant in January 2025."", ""The move, providing WWE access to a broader audience, is a significant step for Netflix, which is behind its competitors Amazon, Apple, and Walt Disney in programming live sports. So, let's look at the deal's reported specifics and what it means for both Netflix and TKO."", ""The partnership is a little more complicated than the headline suggests. That's because the deal doesn't lay out specific dollar amounts for each year, only that the fee will be in excess of $5 billion over 10 years. That could change, however, as Netflix has the option after the first five years to cancel the agreement -- or extend it for an additional 10 years in 2035."", ""In addition to worldwide Raw distribution rights, Netflix will gain international distribution rights to WWE's other weekly shows -- Smackdown and NXT -- and the professional wrestling company's premium live events, including its premier annual event, Wrestlemania. These international rights will immediately be available in Canada, the U.K., and Latin America, with additional regions to be added over time."", 'According to WWE President Nick Khan in an interview on Bloomberg Television, one country that appears to be currently excluded from the deal is India, where professional wrestling is one of the most-watched live event programming. The South Asian country has been a point of emphasis for Netflix management, considering experts estimated the streamer had fewer than 10 million subscribers as of September 2023. Netflix lags behind Disney+ Hotstar and Amazon Prime Video in the geographic market, which have an estimated 40 million and 20 million subscribers, respectively.', ""Finally, in 2025, Netflix will gain access to WWE's documentaries, original series, and upcoming projects, expanding Netflix's international library offerings."", 'Netflix aired its first-ever live sports event in October 2023, with The Netflix Cup, a golf event featuring athletes from Formula 1: Drive to Survive and Full Swing. Netflix is late to the game compared to Amazon, which first broadcast an NFL game in 2017, and Apple, which has regularly shown MLB games since 2022. Over the past few years, streaming services have struck exclusive deals with sports leagues, with the most lucrative average annual value being Amazon, paying approximately $1 billion per year to carry Thursday Night Football exclusively.', 'This agreement with WWE marks Netflix\'s first serious attempt at prolonged sports entertainment programming. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos noted on the company\'s fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call: ""Think of this as 52 weeks of live programming every week, every year. It feeds our desire to expand our live event programming.""', ""Still, it's reasonable to ask why Netflix is putting resources into live programming, especially WWE's Raw, which currently averages fewer than 2 million live viewers on the USA Network. It becomes more sensible when put in the context that it's the USA Network's top-rated show, driving 17.5 million unique viewers per year. Then there's the international opportunity to expand the WWE brand under Netflix's wing, of course."", 'Sarandos also believes this deal will boost Netflix\'s ad revenue, a relatively new revenue stream. He said on the call: ""This should also add some fuel to our new and growing ad business. We\'re very excited about this deal.""', 'In recent years, advertisers have prioritized live events because of real-time engagement and fewer opportunities to skip ads compared to recorded or streamed content.', 'TKO Group is a relatively nascent public company, having formed from the merger of WWE and UFC in September 2023. Even after TKO stock popped on the news of the Netflix deal, it is still down roughly 10% from its first trading day. Despite TKO stock struggling, WWE and UFC offer a unique proposition as the industry leaders in professional wrestling and MMA, respectively.', 'The reason TKO agreed to the deal is more straightforward: It was a higher price than its current deal, and it provided WWE an opportunity to reach a wider audience. Before the merger, WWE generated $1.3 billion in annual revenue for 2022, with 80% coming from its media rights. Under its current Raw deal with USA Network, the company receives roughly $265 million annually and generates roughly $115 million in non-U.S. media revenue (excluding India), totaling approximately $380 million. That means the deal with Netflix replaces roughly 1.3 times its current annual average revenue.', ""At the end of 2023, Netflix had 260 million global subscribers, meaning WWE's product will soon be on most of their televisions. This could lead to growing popularity for WWE and snowball into higher advertising and sponsorship deals, more consumer licensing, higher live event ticket prices, and merchandise sold. While investors will have to wait on how this plays out in TKO's financial statements, it's not hard to see the potential that a partnership with Netflix offers."", 'Netflix and TKO are leaders in their respective industries, commanding higher-than-average valuations. Specifically, Netflix and WWE trade at forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 30.8 and 29.6, respectively. For comparison, the average forward P/E ratio of the companies that make up the S&P 500 is 21.7.', 'Despite the rich valuations, each stock offers a distinct value proposition. Netflix is the only stand-alone streaming service consistently delivering a profit, and in 2023, it grew its paid subscribers an impressive 13% versus 2022. Meanwhile, TKO has a near-monopoly on professional combat sports and has a market-beating track record with WWE. While each stock can be volatile, patient investors might just be rewarded with a championship belt over the long term.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Netflix wasn't one of them.

', 'While it is well established that chromosomal abnormalities are a major cause of miscarriages the biology behind pregnancy losses with or without chromosomal errors is not well understood. Over 114 thousand women from Iceland, Denmark, the UK, USA, and Finland who have experienced pregnancy loss participated in a genome-wide association study, testing 50 million sequence variants. A low-frequency missense variant in the SYCE2 gene was found to increase the risk of pregnancy loss by 22%.', 'In a previous report by deCODE scientists this missense variant was shown to associate with recombination phenotypes in chromosomes that were transmitted from the mother. Recombination between homologous chromosomes is an essential part of meiosis, the generation of the human egg and sperm cell. The product of SYCE2 forms a part of a protein complex that is essential for the alignment of homologous chromosomes for recombination and the missense variant associated with pregnancy loss and recombination is predicted to affect the stability of this protein complex.', 'A closer inspection of the effect of the variant on recombination revealed an effect on the positioning of crossovers that is proportional to the length of the chromosomes, the longer the chromosome the larger the effect. The effect on recombination is measured in live-born individuals. The authors propose that this effect may be more extreme in pregnancies that are lost and may contribute to pregnancy loss. The association with pregnancy loss does not account for embryos lost in early gestation before pregnancy has been detected so the effect of the variant on pregnancy success may be underestimated.', 'The findings reported in this study demonstrate that a variant with a substantial effect on recombinations can be maintained in the population despite increasing the risk of pregnancy loss.', 'Based in Reykjavik, Iceland, deCODE is a global leader in analyzing and understanding the human genome.

MSCI\'s index for Latin American stocks rose 0.5% by 1507 GMT and was set for its first weekly gain in four. A gauge of currencies edged up 0.1%, on track for a marginal weekly advance.

Latin American assets have been on shaky grounds in recent weeks as investors pushed back expectations of U.S. rate cuts from March to May due to economic resilience and hawkish comments from policymakers. With many Latam countries having started an easing cycle, there are concerns that the returns on regional currencies could become less attractive, though some analysts see room for upside ahead. ""The recent repricing of market expectations on the Fed easing cycle beginning in May rather than March has cleaned up positioning and made LatAm markets more appealing,"" Societe Generale strategists said in a note, adding the dollar is likely to weaken ahead.

While it operates in the sleepy utility sector, it's anything but lethargic. It has delivered peer-leading earnings growth over the last decade, beating the industry average by a wide margin. "", 'Even though NextEra is already one of the largest utilities in the country, it expects to continue growing at an above-average pace. That makes it a great option for those seeking outsized returns from this sleepy sector.', 'NextEra Energy\'s CEO, John Ketchum, highlighted the company\'s outperformance compared to its peers on the fourth-quarter conference call. He pointed out, ""Over the past 10 years, we have delivered compound annual growth in adjusted EPS (earnings per share) of roughly 10%, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies. Over that same period, the remaining top 10 power companies have achieved, on average, compound annual growth in adjusted EPS of roughly 2%."" ', ""NextEra Energy has grown at a blistering rate for a utility. Several factors have helped power its ability to grow much faster than its peers. Geography is a big driver. The company's electric utility, Florida Power & Light (FPL), operates in one of the fastest-growing states, so it benefits from strong customer growth (FPL added 81,000 customers during the fourth quarter). Florida also benefits from abundant sunshine. That's enabling the company to build lots of low-cost solar energy capacity. It added 1.2 gigawatts (GW) last year and plans to add another 4.8 GW over the next few years. "", ""Another big growth driver for NextEra is its energy resources segment. The company owns a growing portfolio of energy infrastructure assets (e.g., power plants, gas pipelines, and electricity transmission lines) that support other utilities and end users. This segment provides the company with additional growth drivers. For example, it placed 5.6 GW of new wind, solar, and storage projects into service last year. Those projects helped increase this segment's adjusted earnings by nearly 13%. "", 'NextEra Energy fully expects to continue growing at a strong rate in the coming years. It anticipates that FPL will continue benefiting from Florida\'s abundant sun and outsized population growth. Ketchum stated on the fourth-quarter call that ""by 2032, we expect to increase FPL solar from 5% of our total generation today to roughly 35% by adding over 15,000 incremental megawatts."" On top of that, the company continues ""to believe FPL is strategically well positioned as Florida remains one of the fastest-growing states in the U.S. with a population growth that is expected to roughly double the national average through 2030. Florida\'s economy is also growing and is now the 14th largest in the world if Florida were a country."" ', 'Meanwhile, the company\'s energy resources segment continues to grow briskly as it capitalizes on opportunities to support the country\'s accelerating renewable energy demand. NextEra had a record year for originating new investments in 2023, adding about 9 GW to its backlog, which now stands at over 20 GW. Ketchum noted, ""Energy resources continues to see strong demand and is well positioned to realize its development expectations over the four-year period ending 2026. Assuming we achieve the midpoint of the range, Energy Resources will be operating a roughly 63-gigawatt renewable portfolio by the end of 2026 that would be larger than the installed renewables capacity of all but nine countries."" The company also added a record amount of transmission projects last year, boosting that backlog to $1.9 billion of capital investments through 2027.', 'These catalysts drive the company\'s view that it can continue growing its earnings briskly. While it expects its earnings growth rate to slow to around 5% at the mid-point of its guidance range this year, it sees a reacceleration in 2025 and 2026 of 6% to 8% annual growth from this year\'s range. However, that could prove conservative. Ketchum commented in the fourth-quarter earnings release that ""Given the strength of both businesses, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each year through 2026, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings."" ', ""For context, the company's outlook suggests it will grow faster than most rivals. For example, Duke Energy expects to deliver long-term earnings growth of 5% to 7% annually through 2027. That's also Xcel Energy's long-term earnings growth target range. "", 'NextEra Energy has grown much faster than its rivals over the past few years, thanks to its focus on Florida and renewable energy. Those two catalysts should continue to power above-average growth.

While utilities are traditionally known as slow and steady income investments, NextEra Energy has grown its dividend at a 10% clip over the past decade. That's incredibly fast for a utility and there's no sign that this pace is set to change over the near term."", ""One of the most important things that investors need to know about NextEra Energy is that it is really two businesses in one. The core of the company is its regulated utility operations in Florida, which consist mainly of Florida Power & Light. The regulated utility operation makes up around 70% of NextEra Energy's business."", ""Regulated assets have a monopoly in the regions they serve, but must get rate increases and capital investment plans approved by the government. Generally speaking, this provides a slow and steady growth opportunity, as regulators try to balance the need for profits against the need for reliable and cost-effective power for consumers. That said, the state of Florida continues to see material in-migration, which increases NextEra Energy's customer base and bolsters its earnings capacity. This is an incredibly strong foundation for NextEra Energy."", ""On top of this business, the company operates NextEra Energy Resources, which is one of the largest producers of solar and wind power in the world. This operation is roughly 30% of the company's overall business. It is the growth engine, which was highlighted in the third quarter of 2023 by 21% year-over-year adjusted earnings growth in the division and the fact that it added a record level of new clean energy investments to its backlog."", ""It is the combination of these two businesses that allowed NextEra Energy to increase its dividend at that 10% annualized clip over the past decade. And it is what backs the company's expectations for the future."", ""Currently, NextEra management projects earnings growth to fall between 6% and 8% a year through at least 2026. That's about three years more solid growth ahead and is roughly in line with recent history. As noted, it is the mix of regulated investment and the ongoing global adoption of renewable power will drive that."", ""For dividend growth investors, however, the real story is the 10% dividend growth that has been promised for 2024. That, too, continues the historical trend. But that's as far as the utility has gone, choosing not to make dividend promises that reach too far into the future. That makes logical sense, given that, in a pinch, the quickest way to raise money for investing in the business would be to pull it from cash flow that might otherwise be put toward dividend growth. And yet, if history is any guide, the earning growth projections offered up by management should be sufficient to support dividend growth of 10% or so through the 2026 guidance."", ""In that scenario, the dividend would increase from the current rate of $1.87 per share a year to around $2.48 per share. That's a change that dividend growth investors would greatly appreciate. The exciting piece of the puzzle, however, is that rising interest rates, which make other income alternatives (like CDs) more attractive, have pushed NextEra Energy's stock lower and its dividend yield up to 3.2%. That is near the highest levels of the past decade, suggesting the stock is on sale today."", 'The caveat with NextEra Energy is that the 3.2% dividend yield is actually below the nearly 3.5% yield of the average utility, using Vanguard Utilities ETF\xa0as an industry proxy. Thus, NextEra Energy will probably not appeal to investors looking to maximize current income. It is a dividend growth stock. However, a dividend growth-oriented utility stock will likely be very attractive to a large number of investors.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and NextEra Energy wasn't one of them.

The S&P 500 index is up by 3.1% so far, checking the last box needed to declare a bull market starting in October 2022. History says that these bull runs tend to last for a couple of years, and the gains before the next (inevitable) bear market should run much higher than this strong start.', ""So it's high time to look around Wall Street and find some great buying opportunities at this auspicious moment. Read on to see why five Motley Fool contributors think Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA), NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP), Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI), and the brand-new Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) stand out as excellent investments right now."", ""Daniel Foelber (Tesla): After a year of price cuts and margin compression, Tesla investors were hoping for a turnaround in 2024. That's not what they got on the company's fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call, which included muted guidance for the year on top of an overall weak quarter."", ""Revenue growth was just 3% year over year, operating income fell to $2.1 billion, and the operating margin was 8.2%. For comparison, Tesla's operating income was $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, and its operating margin was 16%."", 'High operating margins have been a differentiating factor for Tesla and a key reason for its premium valuation. Since its margins have been cut in half, it would have to double its revenue to get the same operating income as it did in the 2022 fourth quarter. The ideal scenario is sustaining a relatively high operating margin and growing revenue. But both revenue growth and margins look to be disappointing for a while.', ""Management made it clear on the earnings call that while its vehicles are a good value, they are simply more expensive than the most popular mass-produced vehicles like the Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic. It's harder for consumers to justify paying more when the monthly payment is higher due to high interest rates. And yet, Tesla's Model Y was still the best-selling vehicle (not just EV) in the world last year."", 'The company is doing a good job with what it can control: cost management. Costs per vehicle declined in the fourth quarter, and Tesla is confident it can find further savings in 2024.', 'Specifically, costs per vehicle are falling by about 2% per quarter or around 10% per year. Cost of goods sold per vehicle was just above $36,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to over $39,000 a year earlier.', 'Elon Musk sees Tesla as an artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics company, not just a car company.

From the comments, it doesn't seem that Musk wants to take his AI interests elsewhere but rather wants to ensure the company's governance is intact as innovation becomes irreversible."", 'Overall, Tesla seems to be doing a good job investing in its near-term and long-term growth. The company should be able to take market share during a prolonged downturn.

If so, you can stop reading here and move on to a more traditional stock recommendation."", ""You would be in great company. Warren Buffett will probably never own the tiniest sliver of a Bitcoin.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Masco's (NYSE:MAS) look very promising so lets take a look."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business.

MSCI\'s index for Latin American stocks rose 0.5% by 1507 GMT and was set for its first weekly gain in four. A gauge of currencies edged up 0.1%, on track for a marginal weekly advance. The safe-haven dollar dipped after a report showed U.S. price pressures moderated in December, likely allowing the Fed to begin rate cuts by the middle of this year. Latin American assets have been on shaky grounds in recent weeks as investors pushed back expectations of U.S. rate cuts from March to May due to economic resilience and hawkish comments from policymakers. With many Latam countries having started an easing cycle, there are concerns that the returns on regional currencies could become less attractive, though some analysts see room for upside ahead. ""The recent repricing of market expectations on the Fed easing cycle beginning in May rather than March has cleaned up positioning and made LatAm markets more appealing,"" Societe Generale strategists said in a note, adding the dollar is likely to weaken ahead. ""Overall, we keep our stance of a buy on dips when volatility increases as we believe LatAm’s favourable fundamentals and technicals should keep the region’s FX and rates attractive."" Chile\'s peso dropped 1% while the Peruvian sol also weakened to 3.7809 per dollar, hurt by a dip in the prices of copper. Both countries are major exporters of the red metal. Also weighing on the peso were expectations of a 100 basis points rate cut by Chile\'s central bank next week. The Brazilian real edged up 0.1% in choppy trade after data showed domestic inflation came in well below market expectations, boosting bets of another 50 basis points rate cut at the central bank\'s meeting next week. The Bovespa index gained 0.4%. Brazilian airline Gol dropped 12.1%, a day after it filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States. The Mexican peso and the Colombian peso were up 0.1% each.

However, a few generous dividend payers stand out as great income investments right now. Three Fool.com tech writers are here to share their best dividend ideas right now."", 'Read on to get the deep-dive dividend details on Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Universal Display (NASDAQ: OLED), and Microchip Technology (NASDAQ: MCHP). Each one offers a tantalizing blend of technology leadership, potential for long-term business growth, and a solid history of dividend growth.', ""Nicholas Rossolillo (Qualcomm): By now, you've probably heard that the semiconductor industry has been in a deep slump since the second half of 2022, led downward by consumer electronics. Qualcomm, a leader in mobile chips and the underlying technology that enables mobile devices, has taken it on the chin. Revenue fell 19% in fiscal year 2023 (which ended in September 2023), including a 24% year-over-year dive in sales in the final months of the fiscal period."", 'And yet, Qualcomm remained highly profitable by all metrics during the downturn last year. Not all top semiconductor companies could brag about that.', 'In fact, thanks to a record increase in its inventory of chips, and some of that inventory now getting sold to customers, Qualcomm refilled its coffers. Cash and short-term investments went from $6.4 billion at the end of fiscal 2022 to $11.3 billion at the end of September 2023. And along the way, Qualcomm actually increased its dividend, returning a record $3.46 billion in cash to shareholders last year -- currently good for an annualized dividend yield of 2.1%.', 'Qualcomm also doles out excess cash generated from its business in the form of stock repurchases. Last year, that cash returned via repurchases was $3 billion, another 2% of the current market cap.', ""Free cash flow (from which dividends and stock buybacks are made) totaled nearly $10 billion in fiscal 2023. And with the smartphone market much healthier than in times past, Qualcomm could post an equally good year in 2024, leaving ample room for another dividend payout increase or more stock buybacks. This is one of the top reasons I've been adding to my position in this top mobile chip stock to start the new year."", ""Anders Bylund (Universal Display): Once upon a time, it seemed kind of silly to talk about Universal Display as a dividend investment. The display technology expert's first payout came in February 2017, offering a modest $0.03 per share. The forward yield worked out to a meager 0.2% at the time, based on a share price of roughly $67. That policy is hardly worth the paper it's written on, right? I mean, a company developing the patent-protected technologies behind organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens must be a high-growth tech stock, not a sleepy dividend play."", 'Well, you can actually have it both ways.', 'Dividend investments require a stern focus on a time horizon many years away. Universal Display powered its payouts from a surprisingly deep well of free cash flows, promising hefty dividend increases over the years. Nearly seven years and six payout increases later, the forgettable dividends of old have grown to a respectable $0.35 per quarter or $1.40 annually.', ""That works out to a 0.8% yield if you're buying in at today's prices, around the $180 mark. But if you picked up a few Universal Display shares when the payouts started, you're looking at an effective annual yield of 2.1% on that investment. The company's original position in my current portfolio, started almost exactly 12 years ago, now provides a 4.3% yield against the starting price of $32.41 per share."", ""You see, it's all about those free-flowing cash profits and the company's commitment to splitting that extra cash with shareholders. I expect another payout bump next month, as the company tends to announce each year's first payout near the end of February."", ""The dividend increases have averaged 53% across the six existing bumps, including a 17% boost on the heels of the ghastly market trends in 2022. Free cash flows look a little soft right now due to Universal Display's mid-2023 buyout of 550 OLED patents from German science and materials giant Merck KGaA. That deal made a $66 million dent in Universal Display's cash flows in last year's second quarter, but the cash profits are already trending upward again."", ""On top of Universal Display's top-quality dividend policy, the company is poised to make a mint in a stabilizing economy, as consumers start looking for new phones and high-end TV sets again. Furthermore, the company's target market should expand significantly in the coming years thanks to upgraded manufacturing processes, wider availability of OLED-based lighting panels, and new categories of electronics getting the power-sipping OLED upgrade."", ""These catalysts should send Universal Display's stalled price chart higher in the coming years. The time to buy is now, before that potential hockey-stick moment plays out. Universal Display's increasingly generous dividends may never be this affordable again."", 'Billy Duberstein (Microchip): AI-related chip and equipment stocks are rocketing to all-time highs. However, industrial and auto-related chips, which had been resilient throughout 2022 and for much of 2023, are now entering their post-pandemic correction. So that part of the market may be a good place to look for dividend tech stocks.', 'Microcontroller and analog chipmaker Microchip just preannounced its December-ended quarter, indicating that revenue would be down 22%, as opposed to its November guidance of down 15% to 20%. Management indicated the shortfall was due to a combination of customers cutting back inventory in response to a weakening demand environment, as well as some extended holiday shutdowns, which caused some shipments to move from the December-ended quarter to the March-ended quarter.', ""The strange thing is that the day after that announcement, Microchip's stock was actually up. When a chip stock doesn't go down or actually goes up on bad news, it usually means investors think it is nearing the bottom of the current cycle."", 'Despite the cyclicality that all chip companies experience, Microchip is fast becoming a high-margin blue chip name, so to speak, ever since it hit its target leverage a couple of years ago. That milestone came after five years of paying down the debt stemming from its huge 2018 Microsemi acquisition. But since hitting its leverage target, the company has turned to steadily ramping share repurchases and dividends, not just every year, but every quarter.', ""The plan is to increase cash returns to shareholders by 500 basis points as a percentage of free cash flow every quarter. In the latest quarter, Microchip returned $562 million to shareholders in dividends and repurchases, a figure that represented 77.5% of the previous quarter's free cash flow. Those cash returns will increase 5 percentage points every quarter until reaching 100% by March of 2025."", ""That means investors should look for Microchip's current 1.92%-yielding dividend to grow consistently.\xa0 After all, while the auto and industrial sectors are taking a pause right now, Microchip should be a low-double-digit compounder as autos and industrial equipment utilize more and more chip content every year."", ""Meanwhile, Microchip's stock trades at a very reasonable 20 times forward earnings estimates, and those estimates should indicate the trough of the cycle. That makes the stock a smart pickup for dividend growth investors in early 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Qualcomm right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Qualcomm wasn't one of them.

Nine of the top 20 countries that experienced the highest rate of economic growth between 2018-2022 were African. Despite facing challenges associated with the coronavirus pandemic first, and later the disruption of global supply chains with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the continent remains resilient and recorded a growth of 3.4% in 2023, which is set to rise to 3.8% in 2024, according to the African Development Bank.', 'This region of immense cultural heritage and diversity is home to several countries that wield significant influence on the global stage due to their wealth of natural resources, economic prowess, political soft power, and military strength – all key factors that have an impact on the region’s socio-political landscape.', 'According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Africa is home to 30% of the world’s mineral reserves, 12% of all oil reserves, and 8% of the world’s natural gas deposits. The continent also has 40% of the world’s gold. Therefore, given the wealth of natural resources present in Africa, it is no surprise that several of the world’s largest mining companies such as AngloGold Ashanti plc (NYSE:AU) and Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI) operate in the region.', 'AngloGold Ashanti plc (NYSE:AU) has operations in five mines across Africa. These are in Congo at Kibali, Geita in Tanzania, Iduapriem and Obuasi in Ghana, and at Siguiri in Guinea. According to the company’s financials released in November, the total production of gold at AngloGold Ashanti plc (NYSE:AU)’s mines across Africa was 397,000oz for the quarter ended September 2023 – which accounted for 60% of its overall production worldwide.', 'Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI), which is headquartered in Johannesburg has operations across South Africa and Ghana. In November last year, the company was ranked first among the Top 100 corporations of 2023 list released by the Sunday Times. The company delivered returns of 668% to its shareholders over the last five years, between September 2018 and August 2023. The award is a recognition of Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI)’s financial performance and operational sustainability in Africa’s gold industry.', 'If Africa’s richness of natural resources was not enough, another reason why the continent holds significance is that it is home to several key allies of the western world, some with regional power ambitions.', 'Egypt for instance is an important strategic partner of the United States in ensuring peace and security across the region, and especially in the war against militant groups. The country spends heavily on defense expenditure, in line with President Sisi’s posturing of Egypt as a powerful state in the global stage.', 'In January 2022, the US government approved the sale of three SPS-48 land-based radars to strengthen Egypt’s air defense systems. These radars, which are to be produced by L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) for a contract valued at $355 million, will provide the Egyptians with jamming immunity and capabilities to detect even extremely small targets. A year earlier in February 2021, Egypt received RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)’s Rolling Airframe Missiles for a deal worth $197 million.', 'Defense manufacturers in the United States also have an eye on the ongoing arms race between Algeria and Morocco. While Algiers has bolstered its air capabilities by acquiring Russian fighter jets like Su-30 and entered into a fresh deal with Moscow in 2020 for 14 Su-57 stealth fighters, Rabat is scrambling to secure Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 fighter jets from the US.', 'Morocco believes its strong ties with Israel will help secure a deal with the United States for Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s fifth-generation fighters. Last year in April, the US announced to provide Morocco with HIMARS artillery rocket systems for a deal worth $524 million, with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) as the primary contractor. Moreover, the Pentagon also announced to sell RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)’s Joint StandOff Weapons to Morocco as part of a $250 million deal.', '15 Most Powerful Countries in Africa in 2024', 'The most powerful countries in Africa in 2024 are ranked based on four areas of strength – military, economic, political, and cultural. How well each country did on these metrics was determined by seeing where they ranked on each metric in the continent. Their rankings on each metric were aggregated and then divided by the total number of metrics. For instance, if a country ranked second on military strength, third on economic strength, fifth on political soft power, and tenth on cultural influence, it received an average rank of five (2+3+5+10) divided by 4).\xa0', 'Countries are ranked in descending order of their scores in this article.

Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes.

Of course, the future is what really matters."", ""Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions.

But not long ago, JPMorgan was closer in market cap to Bank of America.

But Berkshire is much more than just insurance. It owns dozens of publicly traded stocks, with nearly half of that portfolio in Apple. But it also owns BNSF railroad and 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. It also generates a ton of profit from its manufacturing, service, and retailing business.', 'All told, Berkshire Hathaway gives investors a bit of everything.', 'Rounding out the Terrific 10 are three exceptional dividend stocks, two of which are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in Home Depot and P&G, while ExxonMobil was in the Dow until 2020.', 'Home Depot is cyclical. Its earnings benefit from strong consumer spending and a growing housing market. The housing market could be a surprise winner in 2024. But beyond that, Home Depot is a stable business that generates plenty of cash to support its growing dividend, even if the economy enters a recession. Home Depot yields 2.3%.', 'ExxonMobil is similar in that it is cyclical and benefits from high oil and gas prices. But the company has used outsize profits in recent years to pay off debt to the point where the balance sheet is now in its best shape in over a decade. Exxon has a plan to increase net income by $14 billion by 2027 based on a conservative Brent crude oil price of $60 per barrel. In this vein, Exxon has a large margin of error to be able to grow its business, buy back stock, and increase the dividend (as it has done for 41 consecutive years). ExxonMobil has the highest yield of the Terrific 10 at 3.9%.', ""Procter & Gamble is the safest of the Terrific 10 companies.

It has pricing power, stable inflows, and generates plenty of extra cash to buy back a ton of stock and raise its dividend -- which it has done for 67 consecutive years. P&G's top brands, paired with its exposure to different consumer categories make it arguably the single safest dividend stock in the entire S&P 500.

As per findings from Franklin Templeton, companies in the S&P 500 that consistently increased or initiated dividends experienced a positive return of 8.58% over the 30-year period ending in December 2022.

This is because stocks near that level are perceived to be winners. However, stocks touching a new 52-week high are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculations are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, investors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices.\xa0Stocks such as The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company GT, Casey's General Stores CASY, Synovus Financial SNV, Arch Resources ARCH and The Bank of New York Mellon BK are expected to maintain their momentum and keep scaling new highs.\xa0 Extensive information on a stock is necessary to understand whether or not there is scope for further upside.Here, we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The strategy borrows from the basics of momentum investing. This technique bets on “buy high, sell higher.”"", 'Many times, stocks that hit a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.In fact, overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay a premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.', 'We ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, you can directly visit\xa0Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 5 Stocks.', ""At the outset of an eventful week, financial markets kicked off cautiously as investors prepared for pivotal announcements from central banks regarding interest rate policies and braced themselves for a flood of corporate earnings reports. Against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, oil prices surged, driving gains in energy-related stocks. The Stoxx 600 index in Europe remained steady, hovering close to its highest level since January 2022, buoyed by robust performances from energy sectors. Meanwhile, futures contracts for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 exhibited stability. Across Asian markets, stocks saw upward momentum fueled by optimism surrounding China's latest efforts to fortify its equity market. As the week unfolds, market participants remain attuned to developments from central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, seeking insights into their rate policy decisions. Additionally, eyes are on an influx of earnings reports, shaping expectations and influencing trading sentiments. Amidst this cautious sentiment, oil prices remain a focal point, driven by geopolitical tensions that could potentially disrupt supply chains and impact global economic dynamics. As investors navigate through a flurry of market-moving events, their attention remains divided between economic indicators, corporate earnings releases, and geopolitical developments, shaping the trajectory of financial markets in the days ahead."", ""In a landmark decision, a Hong Kong court on Monday ruled for the liquidation of China Evergrande Group, marking a pivotal moment for the crisis-ridden property sector in China. The court's judgment, which follows more than two years of Evergrande's inability to present a viable restructuring plan after defaulting on a bond repayment, is poised to reverberate through China's already fragile financial markets. According to Reuters, despite the liquidation order, Evergrande's chief executive Siu Shawn assured continuity in the company's home construction projects. Tiffany Wong, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing a structured approach to preserve value for creditors and stakeholders. The decision sets the stage for a protracted and intricate process, compounded by potential political implications, particularly regarding the recognition of Hong Kong's ruling by Chinese courts. Investors, particularly offshore stakeholders, are keenly observing how foreign creditors will be treated in the event of a corporate collapse. The ruling has immediate ramifications, with Evergrande's shares plunging by as much as 20% before trading was halted. The company's listed subsidiaries, including China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group and Evergrande Property Services, also saw trading suspended after the court's verdict. Given Evergrande's substantial assets and liabilities, estimated at over $300 billion, its liquidation adds further pressure to China's struggling property and financial markets. With Beijing already grappling with economic challenges and a sluggish property market, the ruling compounds existing concerns about investor confidence and growth prospects. The court's decision underscores the severity of Evergrande's financial woes and the urgency of addressing systemic issues within China's property sector. It also highlights the significant risks associated with investing in Chinese companies amid regulatory scrutiny and economic headwinds."", 'In financial markets, notable equities such as Tesla, Inc.

Epstein's downgrade provides valuable insights into The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) current challenges and prospects within the aerospace sector. The downgrade was done\xa0 as the Federal Aviation Administration paused Boeing's scheduled expansion of its 737 Max aircraft production on Wednesday. Epstein's move suggests a more cautious stance towards The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) prospects. The revised price target reflects concerns about The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) ability to navigate industry challenges effectively and deliver sustained growth in the near term. Similar to Tesla, Inc.

The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.', 'Fast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.”', 'Price Reaction after the Downgrade: +0.23\xa0(+1.14%)', ""Just like Tesla, Inc.

These stocks provide investors with a reliable and steadily growing income over time. Additionally, they have demonstrated resilience during economic challenges. As per a Hartford Funds report, companies that have increased or introduced dividends have consistently outperformed other stocks since 1973, especially when compared to those that reduced or eliminated their dividends. Notably, these dividend-paying stocks have exhibited higher returns with considerably lower volatility. This is why many financial experts are currently emphasizing the advantages of integrating dividend-paying stocks as a fundamental component of an equity portfolio when advising their clients.', 'A key driver behind the trend of companies initiating dividends lies in the aftermath of the financial crisis, where corporations experienced a surge in profits, leading to substantial growth in their balance sheets. Since the early 2000s, the cash reserves on corporate balance sheets have more than tripled. This surplus of cash provides corporations with versatile options, including expanding their operations or engaging in acquisitions. A notable choice for many companies has been to deploy the excess cash by either initiating a dividend program or augmenting existing dividend payouts. This strategic use of accumulated funds reflects a proactive approach by companies to enhance shareholder value and leverage their financial strength for sustained growth.', 'Two promising factors for dividend investors are the combination of strong corporate profits among S&P 500 companies and remarkably low payout ratios. According to a report by Hartford Funds, the historical average dividend payout ratio spanning 96 years has been 56.3%. However, as of December 31, 2022, the current payout ratio stands at a mere 37.1%, signifying a substantial gap with ample room for expansion. This presents a promising scenario for dividend investors, as companies appear to have considerable capacity to increase their dividend payouts, potentially leading to enhanced returns for investors in the foreseeable future.', ""In 2023, dividend stocks faced a period of underperformance as yields experienced a significant increase, primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate hikes. However, the outlook for income investing is anticipated to undergo a shift in 2024. With growing expectations for the Federal Reserve to either pause the rate hikes or potentially implement a cut, the dynamics of income investing are poised for a potential transformation. Portfolio Manager John Baldi, overseeing the ClearBridge Dividend Strategy, has expressed an optimistic perspective on dividend stocks for the year 2024. Here are some comments from the analyst:"", '“As a general overall market observation, the macro is highly unpredictable. We entered 2023 with expectations for a recession that was going to start in the back half of this year. We’ve just reported one of the strongest quarters of growth in the recent past.

Humana said costs in this segment will remain elevated through the end of the year.', 'A surge in older patients seeking care last year tipped the balance between premiums and the cost of care for Humana, with delayed care and procedure volumes rising post-pandemic.', '""The Medicare Advantage sector is navigating a complex and dynamic period of change as we are all working through significant regulatory changes while also absorbing unprecedented increases in medical cost trends,"" Humana CEO Bruce Broussard told analysts on a call this week.', '""The increase in utilization that emerged late in the fourth quarter was a significant deviation from an already elevated level impacting the industry.""', ""The company now expects adjusted earnings in 2024 to reach $16 per share, down from $26.09 in 2023. Humana's 2025 earnings forecast now stands at $22-$26 per share; as of November, the company had expected to earn $37 per share in 2025."", 'Following its earnings report on Thursday, Humana stock fell 12%. Earlier this month, shares fell 12% after pre-announcing these downbeat fourth quarter results. Over the last year, the stock is down nearly 28%; the S&P 500 has gained over 20% during this same period.', 'Medicare Advantage has been a highly profitable market and criticized for realizing these profits at the expense of taxpayers.', 'Medicare Advantage was first created in 2003 through legislation. It is supposed to be a more efficient, and sometimes cheaper, alternative to supplemental Medicare plans, known as Medigap. Since 2003, established health insurers and startups alike have oscillated in and out of the market.', 'According to KFF data, 51% of eligible Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan last year.', ""Changes in utilization rates, payments from the federal government, and changing demographics all contributed to Humana's woes in 2023."", ""Primarily, a rise in older patients seeking care resulted in higher-than-expected costs late last year. The company's benefits expense ratio, or medical loss ratio (MLR), hit 91.4% during the fourth quarter in its insurance segment. Analysts had expected this ratio to come in closer to 89.5% during Humana's fourth quarter. MLR is the share of premiums an insurer pays out toward care."", 'In the same quarter last year, Humana reported a benefits expense ratio of 87.4% for this segment.', 'The Affordable Care Act mandates that companies have an MLR of at least 80%-85% each year. Companies like to stay on the lower end of that range, but Humana expects it will stay in the 90% range for 2024.', ""UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which has the highest share of MA membership among all the market's major players, said it is adjusting to lower reimbursements from the Biden administration and is ready to manage the pressure of higher expenses."", '""Despite the shift in care patterns and the commensurate pressure felt during \'23, we have been able to both deliver on our growth commitments and invest and prepare for a reduced [Medicare Advantage] funding cycle over the next three years,"" said CEO Andrew Witty on the company\'s earnings call this month.', 'Humana ranks second among MA plans, with 18% of the total market. United, by comparison, has 29%, according to KFF data.', 'CVS (CVS), through Aetna, has 11%, and Centene (CNC) — once a Medicare Advantage giant — has just 4%. Cigna (CI) serves just 2% of the MA market.', ""But Humana's fortunes are far more tied to the Medicare Advantage business than that of its larger rivals."", ""Take UnitedHealth, for example, which brought in $113 billion in revenue from its Medicare & Retirement segment in 2022, counting for about 45% of the company's total annual revenue. Humana, for its part, saw 81% of its annual revenue come from its Medicare segment in 2022, and over 70% from individual enrollment in Medicare Advantage."", 'Humana has tried for the past several years to merge or be acquired.', 'It first attempted to merge with Aetna in 2015 before a Justice Department ruling in 2017 scuttled the proposal; Aetna later merged with CVS in 2018. More recently, Cigna had sought to acquire Humana before talks broke down.', 'The pressure Humana is facing is also similar to the story for Centene, which recently laid off workers and is expecting further negative impact from the changed star ratings criteria.', 'On the one hand, the pressure Humana and others in the Medicare Advantage market are facing could be short-lived as the whole industry reacts to the surge in usage seen in late 2023.', '""I look at next year as a year that I think the whole industry will possibly reprice,"" Broussard told analysts last week. ""I don\'t know how the industry can take this kind of increase in utilization, along with regulatory changes that will continue to persist in 2025 and 2026. And therefore, I look to the industry to have disciplined pricing as a result of this.""', 'On the other hand, enrollment growth in Medicare Advantage plans going forward may not be as explosive as it once was, as demographic forces — or the ""silver tsunami"" — that once made this market boom fade.', 'As JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note this week: ""By the time the industry has lapped [2023\'s] headwinds and HUM is positioned to return to a more balanced margin/membership profile, we think investors could be focusing more on slowing demographic trends, as growth in the 65+ market is expected to moderate from [high-single digits] to [mid-single digits] in the back half of the decade.""', 'Data from the Census Bureau projects the US population 65 and older to grow from 56.1 million in 2020 to 73.1 million by the end of this decade. Next decade, however, the rate of growth among this demographic is expected to slow, with the Census Bureau projecting that 80.8 million Americans will be over 65 by 2040.', 'Anjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

These figures drop even lower, to 5% or 7%, for emerging markets. With Gerosa and MarketAxess expecting electronic bond trading to mature and account for over 80% of trades for each bond group, the company's growth story could still be in its early chapters."", ""While this growth runway provides plenty of intrigue for investors over the long term, the subdued levels of volatility in today's markets continue to weigh on MarketAxess's financial results, sending its stock down 16% in the past year.

The footwear giant's stock ended 2023 in negative territory, making it one of the worst-performing members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Shares haven't had a great start to the new year, either, declining 6% following last year's 7% slump."", ""With that tough backdrop in mind, let's look at Nike's chances of having a better year ahead from here. There are some encouraging signs of an earnings rebound on the way, but also some factors for investors to be wary about as well."", ""The headline growth result in the holiday quarter wasn't impressive. Nike's sales rose by just 1% in fiscal Q2 after inching up by 2% in the prior quarter. Management said in a conference call with investors that several positive factors impacted the business, including rising prices and higher spending on many of its most expensive footwear models. Nike also didn't need to engage as aggressively in the promotions that are driving prices lower across the industry."", ""Still, the footwear business is far from entering recovery mode. Executives said industry sales were weaker than they expected through the early holiday season. That softness spanned the digital selling channel and hurt traffic at Nike's physical stores as well."", 'Things will likely get worse before they get better, too. Nike is expecting the current demand slump to persist over the next six months, leading to deeper price cuts by retailers that are looking to reduce inventory.', 'Nike\'s inventory cuts last year helped keep it ahead of the game here. Yet it hasn\'t been enough to sync inventory up with demand trends. ""Given the promotional environment and the cautious consumer behavior that we are seeing, we are stepping up our plans to reduce ... supply of our key franchises,"" CFO Matt Friend said in late December.', 'Nike has a lot going for it as it sets the stage for a rebound in fiscal 2025. It should get a boost from a packed calendar of product releases and from fast-growing franchises like Jordan. Add in the combination of declining costs and a slim inventory level, and Nike has a shot at much higher earnings once industry sales trends start recovering.', ""Yet, investors should temper their expectations. Nike has been talking about reaching a sustainably faster growth level for some time, and management hasn't yet been able to hit the target. Whether it was spiking raw material costs, supply chain issues, or stubborn demand challenges in key markets like China and the U.S., investors have been disappointed to see Nike's recovery hopes delayed several times in the past few years."", 'Its industry leadership position, along with the shift toward more direct-to-consumer selling, should allow Nike to meaningfully expand profitability over time.

Here's one way to apply this bit of advice when investing in stocks: Equities that look beaten-down can be great investments, provided there are good reasons to think they can bounce back."", ""Now that we're officially in a bull market -- with the S&P 500 recently hitting a brand-new high -- it might be a great idea to pick up shares of underappreciated stocks from the discount bin before they soar. Let's look at two great examples in the healthcare industry: Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE)."", ""Teladoc is a leading telemedicine provider, but the company hasn't been in the good graces of investors over the past two years. There are several reasons; let's mention two of them. First, Teladoc's revenue and number of visits soared during the pandemic's early days, but have cooled down substantially since. Second, Teladoc's bottom-line numbers have disappointed -- the company remains unprofitable."", 'Despite these issues, there is still hope for Teladoc. One major reason to still buy the stock is that telemedicine is likely here to stay. Various polls over the past three years have revealed that customers are mostly satisfied with having this option. One survey conducted by an insurance company found that though 27% of respondents claimed to have a negative opinion of telemedicine before trying it, more than 90% of them were satisfied with the service and said they would recommend it to a friend after experiencing it.', ""The growing popularity of this healthcare option is an excellent sign for Teladoc. The company ended the third quarter with 90.2 million integrated care members, an increase of 10% year over year. Meanwhile, the company's chronic care unit and BetterHelp therapy service also grew their memberships. Teladoc is arguably building a network effect, as more patients in its ecosystem attract more healthcare providers and vice versa."", ""Furthermore, the company is making progress on the bottom line. It turned a net loss per share of $0.45 in the third quarter of 2022 into a net loss of $0.35. And its revenue and membership numbers are much higher than they were five years ago -- but (promising for prospective investors) Teladoc's share price is lower."", ""Teladoc's forward price-to-sales ratio currently tops 1.2, when anything under 2 is generally considered good. In my view, Teladoc is an excellent stock to buy at current levels, at least for those investors willing to hold the stock for a little while. The company may not recover immediately, but it still has a bright future."", ""Pfizer made a fortune thanks to its fantastic entries in the market for coronavirus vaccines (Comirnaty) and medicines (Paxlovid). It became the first pharmaceutical company to hit more than $100 billion in annual sales, an impressive achievement. However, revenue from the drugmaker's COVID-19 portfolio dropped off a cliff last year, leading to a catastrophic stock-market performance."", ""But there's hope for Pfizer. Last year, the company had an amazing string of regulatory approvals, hitting seven in the calendar year, more than twice the total of any other company in the industry. These new products will rise in prominence and help replace the gaping hole left by Paxlovid and Comirnaty in Pfizer's financial results."", ""And thanks to key acquisitions -- like the $43 billion buyout of cancer specialist Seagen -- Pfizer's innovative wheel will continue spinning. The company's pipeline features 83 programs, including 23 in phase 3 studies and four in the registration stage. This means that revenue and earnings will bounce back eventually, which makes the stock worth buying at current levels."", ""Pfizer's current forward price-to-earnings ratio is 12.2, whereas the pharmaceutical industry's average stands at 17. Investors will also appreciate Pfizer's dividend program. The company currently offers a yield of 5.9%, while it has increased its payouts by about 62%, a decent amount, in the past decade. Investors looking for reliable blue-chip stocks to buy and hold for a while should strongly consider Pfizer."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Teladoc Health right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Teladoc Health, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Teladoc Health wasn't one of them.

Its revenue rose 4% year over year to $17.4 billion, which exceeded analysts' estimates by $100 million. Its adjusted earnings grew 8% to $3.87 per share and also cleared the consensus forecast by $0.07 per share."", ""That earnings beat suggests that IBM's turnaround efforts under CEO Arvind Krishna, who took the helm in April 2020, are finally bearing fruit. But can Big Blue ever fully reinvent itself like Microsoft, which became a high-growth tech giant again over the past decade as it expanded its cloud-based ecosystem?"", ""From 2010 to 2020, IBM's annual revenue decreased from $99.9 billion to $55.2 billion. That persistent decline was caused by two major mistakes."", ""First, IBM's core business software, IT infrastructure, and mainframe divisions struggled as more companies shifted toward cloud-based services. Second, it divested many of its lower-margin segments, which reduced its total revenue."", ""Streamlining its sprawling business initially seemed like the right move, but it plowed most of its cash from its divestments into wasteful share buybacks instead of making meaningful investments in its own cloud ecosystem. By the time IBM finally started focusing on the cloud, it had already lost the public cloud platform market to Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google."", ""Those missteps caused many investors, including Warren Buffett, to abandon IBM. From the beginning of 2010 to the end of 2020, its stock declined 4% as the S&P 500 advanced 237%. Even after factoring in reinvested dividends, IBM only delivered a total return of 38% compared to the S&P 500's total return of 322%."", ""Arvind Krishna and Microsoft's Satya Nadella both led their companies' cloud divisions prior to taking on their CEO roles. That's why it wasn't surprising when Krishna, like Nadella, immediately prioritized the expansion of IBM's cloud business."", ""Krishna's first big move was the divestment of its slower-growth managed infrastructure services unit. Kyndryl spun off in November 2021, enabling IBM to focus on expanding its higher-growth hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) businesses."", ""Realizing that IBM couldn't go head-to-head against Amazon, Microsoft, and Google in the public cloud, Krishna prioritized the development of hybrid cloud services that could process the data that flowed between private and public clouds. The crux of that strategy is its Red Hat subsidiary, which develops open-source software for a wide range of computing platforms. The expansion of that hybrid cloud should also support its development of AI tools for processing all of that data."", 'At the end of 2021, IBM restructured its business into three simpler reporting segments -- software, consulting, and infrastructure -- and set a goal of generating ""sustainable mid-single digit revenue growth"" from 2022 to 2024. At the time, it expected the mid-single-digit growth of its software business and the high-single-digit expansion of its consulting segment to offset the ""flat"" growth of its infrastructure division.', 'Segment', '2022 Revenue Growth', '2023 Revenue Growth', 'Software', '7%', '5%', 'Consulting', '7%', '5%', 'Infrastructure', '8%', '(5%)', 'Total revenue', '6%', '2%', 'Data source: IBM.', 'IBM easily cleared those targets in 2022, but the slower-than-expected expansion of its consulting and infrastructure divisions throttled its growth throughout 2023. But most of that deceleration occurred in the first half of the year, and its growth accelerated again in the second half as its consulting and infrastructure businesses recovered.', ""For 2024, it expects its revenue to rise by the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis, with currency headwinds reducing its reported revenue by a single percentage point. That's in line with analysts' expectations for 3% growth."", ""IBM's prospects are brightening, its stock still looks cheap at 19 times forward earnings, and it pays a hefty forward yield of 3.8%. For value investors, it might look more appealing than Microsoft, which trades at 37 times forward earnings and pays a paltry forward yield of 0.7%. But Microsoft is also growing a lot faster than IBM: Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to both rise 15% this year as it expands its cloud and AI businesses."", ""Therefore, I think it's premature to call IBM the next Microsoft. A few green shoots are appearing, but IBM is still trying to carve out a defensible niche with its newest cloud and AI services, while Microsoft remains a clear leader in both markets. IBM could stabilize its aging business with single-digit revenue growth over the next few years, but it shouldn't be seriously compared to Microsoft until it fires up a few more growth engines."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

Additionally, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) will offer a bonus of up to 200% of base pay to store managers.\xa0', 'Approximately 75% of Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)’s field management teams, like store managers, began their careers in hourly roles. The salary adjustments will impact managers across different pay ranges, with those at the lowest end seeing the largest increases, from $65,000 to $90,000, while those at the top end will remain at $170,000. The changes in pay align with Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) ongoing efforts to increase starting wages, bringing the US average hourly wage to over $18 soon. These adjustments could potentially enhance Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) recruitment and retention strategies in the competitive job market.', ""In 2023, the US economy exhibited unexpected strength by adding 216,000 jobs, surpassing economists' forecast of 175,000. However, this positive momentum was tempered by downward revisions of 70,000 to job gains in October and November. Despite the stable performance, overall job growth in 2023 slowed, with 2.7 million jobs added at a monthly rate of 225,000, down from 4.8 million and 399,000 in 2022.\xa0"", ""While certain industries, like government, health care, and social assistance, continue to drive job gains, others, including trucking and professional services, are lagging. Notably, wage-growth did accelerate, with average hourly pay rising to $34.27 and a yearly increase of 4.1%, slightly above the Fed's target. However, the labor force participation rate declined to 62.5%, marking the biggest drop in nearly three years, potentially complicating the Fed's task of managing inflation. As the job market is anticipated to cool further in 2024, the rise in wage growth and decrease in participation may influence the Federal Reserve to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period."", ""Speaking of wage growth, Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) has announced major benefits for its hourly employees in 2024, with a minimum 3% pay raise (4-5% based on tenure), scheduling improvements, and career mobility opportunities. These changes have come amid the company's ongoing legal battles with Workers United and efforts to enhance the employee experience before potential unionization.

These stocks provide investors with a reliable and steadily growing income over time. Additionally, they have demonstrated resilience during economic challenges. As per a Hartford Funds report, companies that have increased or introduced dividends have consistently outperformed other stocks since 1973, especially when compared to those that reduced or eliminated their dividends. Notably, these dividend-paying stocks have exhibited higher returns with considerably lower volatility. This is why many financial experts are currently emphasizing the advantages of integrating dividend-paying stocks as a fundamental component of an equity portfolio when advising their clients.', 'A key driver behind the trend of companies initiating dividends lies in the aftermath of the financial crisis, where corporations experienced a surge in profits, leading to substantial growth in their balance sheets. Since the early 2000s, the cash reserves on corporate balance sheets have more than tripled. This surplus of cash provides corporations with versatile options, including expanding their operations or engaging in acquisitions. A notable choice for many companies has been to deploy the excess cash by either initiating a dividend program or augmenting existing dividend payouts. This strategic use of accumulated funds reflects a proactive approach by companies to enhance shareholder value and leverage their financial strength for sustained growth.', 'Two promising factors for dividend investors are the combination of strong corporate profits among S&P 500 companies and remarkably low payout ratios. According to a report by Hartford Funds, the historical average dividend payout ratio spanning 96 years has been 56.3%. However, as of December 31, 2022, the current payout ratio stands at a mere 37.1%, signifying a substantial gap with ample room for expansion. This presents a promising scenario for dividend investors, as companies appear to have considerable capacity to increase their dividend payouts, potentially leading to enhanced returns for investors in the foreseeable future.', ""In 2023, dividend stocks faced a period of underperformance as yields experienced a significant increase, primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate hikes. However, the outlook for income investing is anticipated to undergo a shift in 2024. With growing expectations for the Federal Reserve to either pause the rate hikes or potentially implement a cut, the dynamics of income investing are poised for a potential transformation. Portfolio Manager John Baldi, overseeing the ClearBridge Dividend Strategy, has expressed an optimistic perspective on dividend stocks for the year 2024. Here are some comments from the analyst:"", '“As a general overall market observation, the macro is highly unpredictable. We entered 2023 with expectations for a recession that was going to start in the back half of this year. We’ve just reported one of the strongest quarters of growth in the recent past.

Despite this, investors have a lot of to gain from the oil and gas industry as the world\'s economic growth and output is set to come back to normal in the long term. Paul Sankey from Sankey Research recently said while talking to CNBC that while attacks on oil tankers and ships in the Red sea did not cause a rise in oil prices, the fact that WTI crude oil was hovering in the range of $70s shows that prices are not that low and if WTI goes near $75 we are going to see ""very good cash returns"" from oil companies this year.', 'Sankey referred to BP CEO who said that the company was using $60 per barrel as its base price for estimates and planning.

The iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF gained 29% in 2023, beating the S&P 500 returns of 24%. The rise of Magnificent Seven stocks like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and\xa0 Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a sign of the market\'s concentration in quality as investors flocked to companies with strong balance sheets and fundamentals. But what exactly are quality stocks? Billionaire Cliff Asness, Andrea Frazzini, and Lasse H. Pedersen wrote a research paper in 2013 titled ""Quality Minus Junk"" in which they defined quality stocks as follows:', '""We define a quality security as one that has characteristics that, all-else-equal, an investor should be willing to pay a higher price for: stocks that are safe, profitable, growing, and well managed. High quality stocks do have higher prices on average, but not by a very large margin. Perhaps because of this puzzlingly modest impact of quality on price, high-quality stocks have high risk-adjusted returns. Indeed, a quality-minus-junk (QMJ) factor that goes long high-quality stocks and shorts low-quality stocks earns significant risk-adjusted returns in the U.S. and globally across 24 countries. The price of quality – i.e., how much investors pay extra for higher quality stocks – varies over time, reaching a low during the internet bubble.""', 'While the market is expecting rate cuts this year, rising geopolitical tensions and a persistent inflation is keeping the demand for quality stocks higher. Almost all notable investment firms including Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs recommended investors to buy high quality names for 2024. Why? \xa0High-quality stocks tend to perform better when growth is slowing down. A latest Wall Street Journal report quoted data from UBS which said the MSCI ACWI Quality Index has beaten the MSCI’s global index by 1 percentage point over six-month periods in which the economic growth slowed.', 'The research paper from Cliff Asness we mentioned earlier also talked about the returns of quality stocks during troubled times:', '""Our results present a puzzle for asset pricing. They are consistent with quality stocks being underpriced and junk stocks overpriced or, alternatively, with quality stocks being riskier than junk stocks. However, while one can never rule out a risk explanation for the high return of quality stocks, we are unable to identify this risk; in anything, we find evidence of the opposite. We show that quality stocks are low beta and, rather than exhibiting crash risk, if anything they benefit from “flight to quality,” that is, they have a tendency to perform well during periods of extreme market distress. These findings present a challenge for risk-based explanations where bad states of the world are negatively correlated to extreme return realizations of the market factor. Finally, we show that the price of quality varies over time, generating a time-varying expected return on quality-minus-junk portfolios: a low price of quality predicts a high future return of quality stocks relative to junk stocks.""', 'Photo by Adam Nowakowski on Unsplash', 'Methodology', 'For this article we first listed down all holdings of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF with PE ratios less than 30 as of January 26.

That capital concentration indicates that Hohn has a great deal of confidence in both businesses.', ""Visa and General Electric are undoubtedly iconic companies. The former is the most valuable financial services brand in the world, and the latter traces its roots back to Thomas Edison. But iconic companies are not always good stocks. Here's what investors should know."", 'Visa operates the largest payments network on the planet. It accounted for 39% of card-based purchase transactions worldwide in 2022, five points more than China-based UnionPay. Visa also powered 61% of purchase transactions in the U.S., more than every other card payments company combined. That scale creates a network effect that engages more merchants and cardholders over time.', 'Scale also affords Visa a cost advantage. Payment processing is highly scalable, meaning it becomes incrementally more profitable with each additional transaction. Visa handles more transactions than its peers, so it consistently achieves higher profit margins than competitors like Mastercard and American Express. That advantage is illustrated in the chart below.', 'With higher profit margins, Visa can outspend its peers as it pursues growth opportunities. For instance, the company is spending money to gain share in emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Visa is also investing across its three focus areas: consumers payments, commercial and account-based payments, and value-added services like acceptance, analytics, and consulting solutions.', 'Looking forward, global payments revenue will increase at 7% annually through 2027, according to research company McKinsey. Visa will undoubtedly benefit from that tailwind, and it should outpace the industry average given its strong market presence.', 'Indeed, Wall Street expects 11% annual sales growth over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of about 17.4 times sales look tolerable. Investors should strongly consider buying a small position in this blue-chip stock today.', 'In 2021 General Electric announced plans to split into three separate businesses.

The former provides gas and steam turbines that produce power from fossil fuels, and the latter provides onshore and offshore wind turbines. GE Vernova will face headwinds in both spaces. The transition to renewables will be a source of friction for the Power segment, and intense competition will be a source of friction for the Renewable Energy segment."", 'Conversely, GE Aerospace is operating from a position of strength.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growers and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 10 Best Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024.\xa0', 'When considering investments in dividends, the focus naturally shifts towards companies that consistently increase their dividend payouts. These stocks provide investors with a reliable and steadily growing income over time. Additionally, they have demonstrated resilience during economic challenges. As per a Hartford Funds report, companies that have increased or introduced dividends have consistently outperformed other stocks since 1973, especially when compared to those that reduced or eliminated their dividends. Notably, these dividend-paying stocks have exhibited higher returns with considerably lower volatility. This is why many financial experts are currently emphasizing the advantages of integrating dividend-paying stocks as a fundamental component of an equity portfolio when advising their clients.', 'A key driver behind the trend of companies initiating dividends lies in the aftermath of the financial crisis, where corporations experienced a surge in profits, leading to substantial growth in their balance sheets. Since the early 2000s, the cash reserves on corporate balance sheets have more than tripled. This surplus of cash provides corporations with versatile options, including expanding their operations or engaging in acquisitions. A notable choice for many companies has been to deploy the excess cash by either initiating a dividend program or augmenting existing dividend payouts. This strategic use of accumulated funds reflects a proactive approach by companies to enhance shareholder value and leverage their financial strength for sustained growth.', 'Two promising factors for dividend investors are the combination of strong corporate profits among S&P 500 companies and remarkably low payout ratios. According to a report by Hartford Funds, the historical average dividend payout ratio spanning 96 years has been 56.3%. However, as of December 31, 2022, the current payout ratio stands at a mere 37.1%, signifying a substantial gap with ample room for expansion. This presents a promising scenario for dividend investors, as companies appear to have considerable capacity to increase their dividend payouts, potentially leading to enhanced returns for investors in the foreseeable future.', ""In 2023, dividend stocks faced a period of underperformance as yields experienced a significant increase, primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate hikes. However, the outlook for income investing is anticipated to undergo a shift in 2024. With growing expectations for the Federal Reserve to either pause the rate hikes or potentially implement a cut, the dynamics of income investing are poised for a potential transformation. Portfolio Manager John Baldi, overseeing the ClearBridge Dividend Strategy, has expressed an optimistic perspective on dividend stocks for the year 2024. Here are some comments from the analyst:"", '“As a general overall market observation, the macro is highly unpredictable. We entered 2023 with expectations for a recession that was going to start in the back half of this year. We’ve just reported one of the strongest quarters of growth in the recent past. With highly unpredictable macro as a backdrop, I think it’s important to maintain equity exposure.

He has been called ""arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation,"" by Forbes. Tepper has ""consistently outperformed his industry peers and the broader global markets since [Appaloosa\'s] inception,"" according to Tepper\'s bio posted by Carnegie Mellon University.', ""Over the past three years, Appaloosa has outperformed the S&P 500 by 15%, no small feat, given the macroeconomic backdrop. His strong track record suggests that Tepper's stock picks might be worth further review."", ""Investors might be surprised to discover that, to close out the third quarter, Tepper had a whopping 47.1% of Appaloosa's portfolio invested in just five artificial intelligence (AI) stocks:"", 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META): 11.6%', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): 10.2%', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): 9.4%', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): 8.8%', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG): 7.2%', ""Let's take a look at Tepper's five top picks to see why he's so heavily weighted toward these AI stocks."", ""Meta Platforms might seem a surprising choice, but the company has a long history of using AI to bolster its business. The vast majority of Meta's revenue comes from digital advertising, and AI can more accurately surface relevant ads and other content on its social media sites."", ""As the world's second-largest digital advertiser, the recent rebound in ad spending has bolstered the company's fortunes. Meta has also released several AI-powered tools to help advertisers more accurately connect with their target market. Perhaps as importantly, the company developed a leading open-source AI model -- Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI) -- which is available on all the major cloud infrastructure platforms, resulting in an entirely new revenue stream for the company."", ""At just 20 times forward earnings, Meta is selling at a discount compared to the broader market -- which likely factored into Tepper's investing decision."", 'Microsoft saw the writing on the wall and invested $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI over the past few years, helping spotlight the potential for generative AI. Its big tech rivals quickly follow suit, kicking demand for AI into overdrive. The tech giant answered the growing demand by infusing AI functionality across a broad swath of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. Furthermore, all the most popular AI models are available on Azure Cloud.', ""The biggest coup, however, was the debut of Microsoft Copilot, its AI assistant. Its ability to increase user productivity has generated strong demand and could produce incremental revenue of up to $100 billion by 2027, according to analyst calculations. Azure's growth outpaced the competition in the third quarter, and Microsoft pointed out that three percentage points of that growth was the result of growing demand for AI."", ""Microsoft is currently trading for 31 times forward earnings. While that's a slight premium to the market, the company's strong legacy businesses and the opportunity afforded by AI make Microsoft a bargain at this price, which likely didn't escape Tepper's notice."", 'While some viewed Amazon as slow out of the gate, it has jumped into the AI opportunity with both feet. The company has long used AI to handle product recommendations, inventory levels, delivery routes, and more.', ""Yet that's just the beginning of Amazon's AI opportunity. The company is now using generative AI to improve product listings, generate review summaries, and refine advertising. It also is working on an AI-powered tool that can answer questions about specific products."", ""There's more. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a growing list of popular generative AI models, including a few of its own via its Bedrock AI. The company has also unveiled several AI-centric chips, including Inferentia and Trainium, designed to speed AI processing for AWS customers."", ""Despite its strong recovery last year, Amazon is still selling for just 2 times forward sales, the standard for an underpriced stock, which likely piqued Tepper's interest."", ""No discussion about AI stocks would be complete without a nod to Nvidia, a point highlighted by Tepper's position. Nvidia pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that revolutionized gaming and are the gold standard for AI applications."", ""Nvidia's processors have cornered the market in both data centers and machine learning, with an estimated 95% share in each. Experience in the field helped Nvidia quickly pivot to address the growing demand for generative AI."", ""Competitors are scrambling to develop competing processors, but Nvidia continues to maintain its edge. For the nine months ended Oct. 29, 2023, Nvidia spent $6.2 billion, or 16% of its total revenue, on research and development. The company's track record of continuing innovation will make it difficult to supplant."", ""Despite the stock's recent run, Nvidia is still remarkably cheap, sporting a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 -- that benchmark for an undervalued stock -- of which Tepper was no doubt keenly aware."", ""Like Meta Platforms, Alphabet makes the lion's share of its revenue from digital advertising, in this case fueled by Google Search. The company has an impressive track record of deploying AI to improve its search algorithms and ad targeting, and the recovering ad market will no doubt improve the company's results."", ""Alphabet didn't sleep on the potential of generative AI. The company integrated AI functionality into many of its flagship Google and Android products. As one of the Big Three cloud providers, it was able to expand the number of AI systems available to its Google Cloud customers."", 'Its most recent offering, Gemini AI, is being hailed by the company as its ""largest and most capable AI model,"" outperforming rivals using a variety of widely used benchmarks. Furthermore, Alphabet\'s Vertex AI provides access to 130 foundational AI models with something for just about every use case.', ""The company's rebound over the past year notwithstanding, Alphabet still sells for just 19 times forward earnings, a valuation that Tepper likely couldn't pass up."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

One of the handful of companies that beat it was a little-known AI stock called Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI).

Let's take a closer look at Super Micro Computer and whether it's a smart buy today."", ""It's not a coincidence that Supermicro stock delivered results similar to Nvidia last year. The company has a lot in common with the AI chip kingpin."", 'Super Micro Computer makes high-performance and high-efficiency server and storage systems that are especially useful for AI applications.', ""As Supermicro explains it, AI workloads typically require expedited access to storage, which has driven demand for GPU-based servers. Supermicro's server systems run on Nvidia GPUs and help maximize throughput, eliminate bottlenecks, and minimize latency. The accelerated IO (input/output) of those systems can improve performance by 20% to 100% for intensive workloads."", 'That technology and its utility in running AI models is starting to drive significant growth at Supermicro.', 'Much like Nvidia did a few quarters ago, Supermicro just reported preliminary results for its fiscal second quarter that were much better than its forecast back in November. Supermicro reported revenue of $3.6 billion to $3.65 billion, compared to its earlier guidance of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. On the bottom line, it posted adjusted earnings per share of $5.40 to $5.55, which was ahead of its prior forecast of $4.40 to $4.88.', ""Supermicro didn't offer much of an explanation for the soaring growth, only saying that it had strong market and end customer demand. Investors will likely learn more when Supermicro reports its complete second-quarter earnings report after hours on Monday."", ""Supermicro's update was reminiscent of Nvidia's hockey-stick-like growth last year as its revenue suddenly tripled, greatly exceeding Wall Street's expectations."", ""Supermicro appears to be on a similar path given the dramatic growth in the stock, but there's an important difference between the two companies. Supermicro operates with narrow gross margins. In the first quarter, they were just 16.7% and actually fell from the year before."", ""Typically, a company with low gross margins does not have pricing power, or it's competing on cost. That's much different from Nvidia, which has been able to raise prices on its AI chips because there's a shortage of them and its competitors can't match its performance, at least not yet."", ""Both stocks also trade at reasonable valuations. In fact, Supermicro is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 34, including its second-quarter result. Hardware is cyclical, and the fact that SuperMicro and Nvidia have relatively low P/E ratios for their growth rates shows that the market is skeptical that the current boom will last. Unlike software, hardware isn't recurring revenue, and semiconductor companies tend to see revenue fall in down cycles."", 'However, the AI boom still appears to be just getting started as hyperscalers like Oracle are building data centers as fast as they can, and the hardware needed to run them is likely to be in high demand for the foreseeable future.', ""There's still a lot of uncertainty in the evolving AI market, which means that Supermicro stock carries risk, but with the updated guidance, its similarities to Nvidia, and unprecedented demand for AI hardware, the upside potential clearly outweighs the downside risk."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Super Micro Computer wasn't one of them.

Holding Apple stock will yield 0.49% annually, whereas Nvidia stock yields 0.03%.', 'In other words, if you invested $150,000 split equally among the three stocks, you would earn $627.94 per year, or a blended yield of 0.42%. That might not sound attractive considering the high interest rates right now, where even cash sitting in the bank can earn over 5% per year.', ""However, investors should weigh that dividend income stream against the substantial capital growth in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Above, I shared their returns for 2023, and here's a look at how much each of the three stocks gained over the last five years."", ""In other words, had you invested that $150,000 equally across the three companies in 2019, it would be worth $1.1 million today -- even if you didn't reinvest the dividends."", ""Past performance doesn't predict future results, but the global economy is entering a technological revolution unlike anything investors have seen in the past.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky."", 'Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.', ' See our latest analysis for Walt Disney ', 'As you can see below, Walt Disney had US$46.4b of debt at September 2023, down from US$48.4b a year prior. On the flip side, it has US$14.2b in cash leading to net debt of about US$32.2b.', 'Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Walt Disney had liabilities of US$31.1b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$61.4b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$14.2b and US$12.3b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$66.1b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', 'Walt Disney has a very large market capitalization of US$174.5b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.', ""We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio)."", ""Walt Disney has net debt worth 2.2 times EBITDA, which isn't too much, but its interest cover looks a bit on the low side, with EBIT at only 6.0 times the interest expense. While that doesn't worry us too much, it does suggest the interest payments are somewhat of a burden. It is well worth noting that Walt Disney's EBIT shot up like bamboo after rain, gaining 37% in the last twelve months. That'll make it easier to manage its debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Walt Disney can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Looking at the most recent three years, Walt Disney recorded free cash flow of 40% of its EBIT, which is weaker than we'd expect. That's not great, when it comes to paying down debt."", ""On our analysis Walt Disney's EBIT growth rate should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For example, its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow makes us a little nervous about its debt. Considering this range of data points, we think Walt Disney is in a good position to manage its debt levels. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

The company just reported its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023, and it added 13.1 million subscribers, a record for the period."", ""Netflix now has over 260 million subscribers, which is significantly more than any of its competitors -- it's a whopping 110 million more than Disney's flagship Disney+ service, which is consistently a top-three streaming provider."", ""Below, I'll explain how the record result came about and discuss five things smart investors learned from the fourth-quarter report."", ""Netflix battled with its account-sharing issue for years. Subscribers would often lend their password to friends and family members, which meant 100 million households around the world were using Netflix completely free of charge (according to the company's estimates)."", ""In mid-2022, Netflix lost subscribers for the first time in 10 years, which prompted a crackdown on password sharing. Now, a subscriber's account will no longer work outside of their household. Instead, those on the standard ($15.49 per month) plan can add one extra member outside of their household for just $7.99 per month. Subscribers on the premium ($22.99 per month) plan can add two extra members for $7.99 per month each."", ""So, while the additional members are paying far less than full price for their subscription, it's better than nothing. This strategy was a key part of the company's huge subscriber increase in Q4."", 'In the quarterly shareholder letter, management said, ""We believe we\'ve successfully addressed account sharing,"" and it could help Netflix further penetrate its addressable market of 500 million connected TV households more effectively.', 'Besides forcing password sharers to pay, Netflix is trying to attract new users by offering a cheaper ad-supported subscription tier. The company launched it at the end of 2022 with a price point of $6.99 per month, and it has already amassed 23 million monthly active users. In fact, the ad tier is responsible for 40% of all new sign-ups (in markets where the ad tier is active).', ""The economics of advertising require scale to work. In other words, businesses won't spend their marketing dollars on a streaming platform with a small user base. They want to reach millions of viewers to increase their chance of a positive return on their investment."", ""Netflix's ad tier might be reaching that point, and in the middle of last year, management said it's already bringing in as much revenue per user as the $15.49-per-month standard tier. That implies Netflix is generating more than $8 in advertising revenue per user, per month, on top of the $6.99 subscription fee."", 'The company has only scratched the surface of its opportunity. It says there is $25 billion spent on connected TV ads every year, and considering Netflix accounts for less than 10% of the time people spend watching TV, there is plenty of room to grow.', ""The key to bringing in more advertising dollars is keeping users engaged with more content. Netflix plans to spend a whopping $17 billion on producing and licensing movies and TV shows this year, which is near a record high. Meanwhile, competitors are slashing their budgets as they struggle to match Netflix's scale and profitability. Last year, Disney revealed plans to cut around $4.5 billion from its content budget going forward."", ""With its competitors adopting a defensive stance, 2024 is a great time for Netflix to get aggressive and exert maximum pressure. The company is launching new seasons of smash-hit TV shows Bridgerton, Squid Game, and Formula 1: Drive to Survive. It's also releasing new shows featuring megastars like Sofia Vergara and Benedict Cumberbatch, as well as a series from the showrunners responsible for Game of Thrones."", ""Subscribers can also look forward to a number of exciting movies, including Eddie Murphy's return in Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F."", 'But Netflix made headlines recently\xa0when it announced a deal with TKO Group Holdings\xa0to acquire the global rights to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Netflix will stream WWE Raw live every week in all major markets around the world. Outside the U.S., it will also show Smackdown and NXT, plus one-off live events like WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Royal Rumble.', ""Reports suggest the deal is worth $5 billion over 10 years (to begin in Jan. 2025), and it's a milestone in Netflix's pursuit to deliver more live programming."", ""Given so much of Netflix's subscriber growth is coming from cheaper options like the ad tier and sharing offer, the company's revenue growth has been muted over the past year. For example, in Q2 2023, Netflix delivered an 8.0% year-over-year increase in subscribers but only a 2.7% uptick in revenue."", 'That gap has been closing. In Q4, subscribers grew 12.8% and revenue rose 12.5%, marking the fastest quarterly revenue increase in two years. There are a few reasons for that.', ""First, Netflix increased the price of its premium tier by $3 near the end of last year, so it's now pulling in more revenue from those subscribers. Second, Netflix eliminated its $9.99-per-month basic plan, so users seeking the cheapest option will have to go with the ad tier. As I mentioned earlier, the ad tier generates as much revenue per user as the standard tier, so while the user pays less, Netflix makes more."", 'Finally, the company should generate a growing amount of advertising revenue as more members sign up for the ad tier, making it more lucrative per user over time as it scales.', ""In its Q4 call with investors, management hinted more price hikes could be coming in the near future, so Netflix's revenue acceleration still has legs."", ""Netflix's Q4 results received a warm reception from investors, and its stock has jumped 16% since they were reported. Based on the company's $12.01 in earnings per share for full-year 2023 and a stock price of about $570, Netflix trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 47."", ""That's more than double the 22 P/E ratio of the S&P 500 index, and it's also more expensive than the 31 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100. In that context, Netflix stock doesn't look very attractive."", ""However, traditional valuation metrics aren't always a good indicator of whether you should buy a stock. Netflix has delivered a staggering return of 46,890% since it went public in 2002, and its 47 P/E is much closer to its cheapest-ever level than its most expensive."", ""In fact, Netflix hasn't always been profitable, so the P/E ratio wasn't even applicable during certain periods. If you avoided the stock purely because it wasn't trading at a cheap valuation relative to the broad market, you would have missed the chance to earn incredible returns."", ""With that in mind, Netflix stock is worth owning for the long term because of the company's growing dominance in the streaming industry. Its pricing power will increase as its competitors continue to sputter, and its content catalog will only expand as more media companies have little choice but to license their shows and movies to the world's biggest platform."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Netflix wasn't one of them.

Despite this, investors have a lot of to gain from the oil and gas industry as the world\'s economic growth and output is set to come back to normal in the long term. Paul Sankey from Sankey Research recently said while talking to CNBC that while attacks on oil tankers and ships in the Red sea did not cause a rise in oil prices, the fact that WTI crude oil was hovering in the range of $70s shows that prices are not that low and if WTI goes near $75 we are going to see ""very good cash returns"" from oil companies this year.', 'Sankey referred to BP CEO who said that the company was using $60 per barrel as its base price for estimates and planning.

The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Oracle’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.', ' See our latest analysis for Oracle ', 'Great news for investors – Oracle is still trading at a fairly cheap price. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $172.37, but it is currently trading at US$115 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Oracle’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.', 'Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 53% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Oracle. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.', 'Are you a shareholder? Since ORCL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ORCL for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy ORCL.

If you want to skip our take on the market as the new year officially begins, then you can take a look at the top five stocks in this list by clicking 5 Best Performing Growth Stocks in January 2024. ', ""\xa0The start of 2024 shows that even the best of forecast and the most capable of analysts can sometimes be wrong. The first month of the new year is full of news about economic data that is setting the tone for markets and the economy for the rest of 2024. 2024 is an important year, not only because it should see interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, but also because it's election year in the U.S. Elections in America affect not only Americans, as has been evident by the charged environment of recent years, but also the world since decisions made in Washington have global effects. "", 'Last year had started out with investors worrying that rapid and significant interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve would sap economic activity and tip America into a recession. However, the economic data for the fourth quarter shows that the U.S. GDP grew by 3.3% - which is far, far away from a recession and mouth watering when we consider the economic troubles of powerhouses such as Germany and China. Not only did the economy grow by 3.3% in Q4, but for the full year, growth sat at a respectable 2.5%.', ""However, while economic growth is always welcomed by politicians, given the current market climate, for investors it paints a more complicated picture. This is because while a growing economy is beneficial for businesses and the stock markets, these days it also means that the Fed might be able to keep rates higher for longer. A key balance that Fed officials have to strike now that they've avoided a recession in 2023 is to start reducing rates before it's too late and keep them high enough for just the right time to make sure that inflation does not increase."", 'Overall, the economy influences investor perceptions about stocks and their future. Stocks are broadly divided into two categories, namely value stocks and growth stocks. Value stocks are those that are reasonably priced with respect to their earnings per share. These are stocks that belong to stable companies with consistent markets that are able to buffer drops in spending power during an economic downturn.', ""On the other end are growth stocks. These belong to companies that are operating in markets with untapped potential for revenue. The market, sensing this, prices the shares higher with respect to their earnings, and the resulting differential is captured through a price to earnings ratio. The higher this ratio (which uses either the latest twelve month, fiscal year, or forecast/estimated earnings), the more optimistic investors are about the stock's ability to grow in the future."", 'As it might also sound intuitive, growth stocks do well when people and businesses have money to spend. This is influenced by the economy and interest rates, both of which influence the ease with which money is available for spending. Therefore, when access to capital is cheap, there is more spending, and high growth industries such as technology end up benefiting as a result.', ""In fact, picking out the right growth stocks at the right time can often provide an investor with the potential to double or even triple their money. As an illustration, consider the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA's shares are up by a whopping 1,500%+ over the past five years. So, if you'd bought $100 of stock in January 2019 - less than a year before the pandemic struck - then your small investment would be worth roughly $1,700 now. That's a big gain, and a $10,000 investment would have meant a profit of $160,000 in just five years - or equivalent to the combined average starting salary for a Master's graduate in the U.S. for two years."", ""NVIDIA became the growth stock in 2023 as investors realized the massive potential offered by its products to train mathematical models\xa0 commonly known as artificial intelligence. A.I. is a part of the public imagination now, and since it relies on making inferences or predictions using data, its use cases are quite ubiquitous as well. Whether it's medical science, fraud detection, drug research, logistics, shipping, or even writing, A.I. models carry with them the advantage of having a treasure trove of data to use and inform decision making."", ""Couple the investor interest in A.I. with the rosier economic conditions we're seeing at the start of 2024 and one might even start to think that growth stocks could do nothing else but grow this year. One way to see which growth stocks are worth their salt is to see their performance in 2024 so far in response to the shifting economic environment. Today we've done just this and the top growth stocks of January 2024 are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX).

But profitable tech stocks that do pay dividends often have a history of growing those payouts handsomely for years and years."", 'For instance, chip giant Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) began paying a dividend back in 2004. While the initial payout was small, TI has grown that dividend at a 25% annualized rate for 20 years, making its current dividend 58 times higher than those initial payouts!', 'Like TI back in 2004, a few major tech stocks just initiated dividends in the last few years, making it potentially a great time to pick up shares of those stocks. Each of the following tech names have lots of potential growth across artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G, so look for these payouts to rise in the years ahead.', 'Memory and storage chipmaker Micron (NASDAQ: MU) initiated a dividend back in late 2021, as the company was riding a pandemic wave of high demand, and had achieved technological superiority over competitors.', 'Oopsie! As it turned out, Micron was on the brink of one of the worst memory downturns ever, as the post-pandemic economy and fastest-ever interest rate increases led to a huge drop-off in demand in 2022 and 2023.', ""But even though Micron's profitability fell into the red, over the past 18 months, the company still decided to raise its dividend by 15% in 2022, good for a 0.52% yield at today's prices."", 'Needless to say, the memory players have learned their lesson. Over the course of the past year, major memory companies have cut production 25%-30%, and demand is now growing again to catch up with supply. Memory prices are now rising, with research firm Trendforce predicting 13%-18% price increases for DRAM and 15%-20% price increases for NAND flash this quarter alone. Moreover, the research firm even thinks prices could continue rallying through the fourth quarter of 2024 if suppliers stick to their newfound discipline.', 'DRAM memory could especially be in for a sustained rally, as high-bandwidth memory DRAM, or HBM, is now a hot commodity as a key bottleneck for AI systems.', ""Micron was a bit late to the HBM game, but it's now shipping its new HBM3E product that boasts 10% better performance and 30% lower power consumption than the next-best solution on the market. That's thanks to Micron's technology leadership it achieved over the past few years under CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. As a result of its technological prowess, Micron and other analysts believe it will get a large allocation to Nvidia's GH200 superchip platforms in the first half of this year."", ""While Micron's stock has already rallied well off its lows, it's still below its all-time high from early 2022. If investors wait for Micron to actually begin minting profits and increasing its dividend payout, the stock will likely be higher by then."", ""Investors had a somewhat muted reaction to T-Mobile's (NASDAQ: TMUS) latest earnings report, but it's difficult to understand why. After all, despite taking market share in recent years, T-Mobile still managed to trounce analyst expectations for postpaid phone net subscriber gains with 934,000 in the fourth quarter. That was way ahead of estimates of 874,000, and well above the 526,000 for AT&T and 449,000 for Verizon."", 'Investors may have initially seen a ""miss"" on earnings per share, but that was due to some non-core items. T-Mobile was able to take some accelerated depreciation on existing assets, which is a non-cash accounting charge, and the company continued to pay some severance for the restructuring and layoffs it executed late last summer. There are also some remaining integration charges stemming from the 2020 acquisition of Sprint.', 'None of those costs are permanent or really core to the business. But what is important for investors is adjusted free cash flow, and management just guided for 22% free cash flow growth in 2024 to a range between $16.3 billion and $16.9 billion.', ""But 2024 free cash flow is likely to be much better than that. T-Mobile typically guides conservatively, and that guidance also didn't count any phone lease securitizations that T-Mobile typically sells to outside investors."", 'But T-Mobile pretty much always monetizes equipment leases through securitizations every quarter. In fact, T-Mobile has monetized just over $4.8 billion in securitizations in each of the past two years.', ""So one could likely expect much higher cash flow in 2024, probably between $18 billion and $20 billion. Given T-Mobile's $193 billion market cap, the stock is still only trading around 10 times this year's likely free cash flow. Given its industry-leading growth and lead in 5G, its stock still looks cheap. And the company's 1.6% dividend, which it just initiated late last year, seems set to grow by double-digits well into he future."", ""Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has had a difficult five years or so, and the stock pulled back after its recent earnings report. In fact, earlier this year, the company cut its dividend to just $0.50 annually, from $1.46. However, even that reduced payout is good for a 1.15% yield at today's depressed stock price."", ""Intel was of course trying to conserve cash to execute its ongoing turnaround. Up until the recent earnings report, that seemed to be going well. In fact, even in the fourth quarter, Intel's revenue and adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share came in handily ahead of analyst estimates."", 'The problem was guidance, which came in at revenue of just $12.7 billion at the midpoint, well below consensus of $14.2 billion. That led to an 11.9% decline in the share price last Friday.', ""But the concern may be overblown. According to management, much of the shortfall is due to known declines in Intel's Mobileye unit, which also has publicly traded shares and had already pre-announced a huge 50% sequential revenue decline earlier this month because of customer inventory corrections. Moreover, Intel also noted its PSG programmable chip business would be down, as that portion of the semiconductor market is also known to be in a correction."", 'However, for Intel\'s most important ""core"" units, including PC client and data center chips, all seems to be OK. CEO Pat Gelsinger noted no market share loss in these key areas, which would be a concern.', ""Importantly, Intel's technological roadmap appears still be on track, as the chip giant is looking to achieve five nodes in four years and catch up with tech leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Moreover, Intel's new Gaudi 3 AI processor is on track for production this year. Encouragingly, Gelsinger noted the demand pipeline for Gaudi expanded by double-digits sequentially last quarter to well over the $2 billion figure given on the prior quarter's call."", 'Make no mistake, Intel still has a long way to go in its turnaround. Even for 2024, management forecast free cash flow at just breakeven.', ""But that's up from an $11.8 billion cash burn in fiscal 2023 -- a huge improvement. And the sell-off on weak guidance appears to be due to less-important parts of Intel's portfolio. If Gelsinger & company continue to get the big things right on CPUs and AI accelerators, this could be an opportunity for aggressive investors to pick up shares of this turnaround story on the cheap."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Micron Technology wasn't one of them.

The benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 each hit new all-time highs on Jan. 19. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average has been hitting successive new PRs since December of last year.', 'The new records have been reached thanks, in large part, to the continued rally in technology stocks. Specifically, the stocks of microchips and semiconductor companies tied to artificial intelligence (AI) have been leading the market higher. While impressive, chip stocks aren’t the only game in town.', 'Beyond tech, other stocks worth owning, many of which are undervalued and available to buy on the cheap right now.

In recent years, its focus and resources have largely gone to reviving the BK chain that has fallen behind McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and other competitors.', 'Recently, QSR announced that it is taking full control of Carrols Restaurant Group (NASDAQ:TAST). The $1 billion deal is with its largest U.S. Burger King franchisee. Carrols operates more than 1,000 Burger King restaurants and 60 Popeyes locations across America. Currently, Restaurant Brands owns 15% of Carrols and is now taking full control. The company is moving away from larger franchisees, such as Carrols, in favor of local franchisees as part of its turnaround strategy.', 'Previously, QSR announced its investment of $500 million to remodel 600 of Carrols’ Burger King outlets.

Dietrich, previous CEO of private aviation firm Atlas Air Worldwide, began buying FedEx shares after the company reported disappointing earnings on Dec. 19, sending the stock down 12% in a single trading session. The shares have been trading sideways to start 2024. This presents a buying opportunity for investors.', 'Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com', 'Investors looking for a microchip and semiconductor stock to play the artificial intelligence (AI) trade might want to look at Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). The stock has been rising along with the entire chip sector, but not as fast as many other semiconductor securities. Year to date (YTD), MU is up 6% and gained 50% in the past 12 months. Compare that to the 26% YTD gain in the stock of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), whose share price is now up 150% in the last 12 months.', 'MU stock has been on an upswing since the company reported earnings right before Christmas that beat Wall Street forecasts. The still unprofitable Micron announced a loss of 95 cents a share for its fiscal first quarter, which was better than a loss of $1.01 that was expected. Revenue totaled $4.73 billion, which topped consensus forecasts of $4.58 billion. Micron is a leader in dynamic random-access memory chips often used in desktop computers and servers, and flash memory found in hard drives.', 'The company gave a bullish outlook for artificial intelligence (AI), saying on its earnings call that generative AI would drive “multiyear growth” at the company. Additionally, MU said that inventory levels for its memory and storage chips are at normal levels. In fact, it is working with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) on some upcoming AI chips.

Here's what you need to know."", 'With a market cap of roughly $110 billion, Prologis is one of the largest REITs you can buy. It has a portfolio of more than 5,500 warehouses spread across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. In total, it owns 1.2 billion square feet of warehouse space in 20 countries, almost every foot of which is located in a key global distribution hub. That makes it something of a one-stop shop for customers.', ""Right now, the company is benefiting from the rollover of existing leases to current market lease rates. The numbers are huge, with the fourth quarter of 2023 seeing new leases signed at rates that were roughly 74% above the expiring lease. While the industrial REIT can't keep that kind of growth going forever, leases don't all expire at one time, so there's more benefit to come from lease expirations. Longer term, Prologis also owns undeveloped land around its properties on which it can build new warehouses. Management estimates this to be a $40 billion opportunity. So there are multiple avenues for future growth, both short term and long term."", ""That said, investors have soured somewhat on the warehouse sector as online shopping and related logistics needs that exploded during the pandemic return to prior levels. This has pushed the stock well below its recent peak and the yield toward decade highs. At 2.8%, the dividend yield won't excite you, but the company's growth prospects suggest that dividend growth will continue to be attractive. On that score, the dividend increased by a huge 11% per year over the past decade."", ""The diversification in Prologis's property portfolio is a definite plus, but sometimes a highly focused portfolio can be just as attractive. That's the case with Rexford Industrial, which operates exclusively out of Southern California. It is a much smaller REIT, with a market cap of almost $12 billion and a portfolio that spans 45 million square feet of warehouse space."", ""The big story here is that Southern California is the largest warehouse market in the U.S. and has some of the lowest vacancy rates in the country. The Southern California region is actively working to increase housing and limit warehouse development (with many warehouse locations actually being converted to housing), which should keep demand high for years to come. This has supported the same large rent boosts that have benefited Prologis. With the severe supply constraint, however, Rexford's unique regional focus is likely to lead to many years of strong rent growth for the REIT."", ""The dividend yield is a modest 2.8%, but like Prologis, dividend growth has been very attractive at around 18% per year during the past five years. Investors' negative view of warehouses, meanwhile, has also pushed Rexford's yield toward decade highs despite the strong fundamentals of the business."", ""One chart tells you the whole story about Annaly and why dividend investors will probably want to avoid it. As seen below, despite offering a 10%-plus dividend yield for most of the past decade, Annaly wasn't a great stock to own given multiple dividend cuts and the steep share-price decline."", ""So, in the end, buying Annaly's big yield would have left investors with less income and big paper losses (if not realized losses). That's a bad outcome if you are trying to live off of the income your portfolio generates."", ""To be fair, Annaly isn't exactly a bad REIT. It is just a mortgage REIT, which is a unique and complex business that is heavily affected by interest rate changes and property market dynamics, among other things. Annaly is really a way for institutional investors, using an asset allocation framework, to get exposure to mortgage securities. But the huge yield often lures in individual dividend investors thinking that they have found a diamond in the rough. History suggests that won't end up being the case."", ""It is very easy for an investor to be beguiled by Annaly's 13.2% yield. But a dividend yield alone isn't enough of a reason to buy a stock, as the REIT's terrible dividend history shows. That said, the backstories behind Prologis and Rexford are much more attractive, even though their yields are lower. Most investors would be much better off with the lower yielders here."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Prologis right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Prologis, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Prologis wasn't one of them.

If you want to skip our discussion on the population trends, you can go directly to the 5\xa0Biggest US Cities Facing Depopulation by 2100.', 'According to the Census Bureau, the number of US inhabitants is likely to increase to about 366 million by 2100, which implies decelerating growth compared with previous decades. In fact, almost half of the 30,000 US cities are projected to experience population loss by 2100. Moreover, the distribution of population within the country is likely to change, with an increase in population in suburban and rural areas and a decline in urban centers, some shrinking by as much as 25%. The Midwest and Northeast regions are slated for the harshest declines, with urban centers and low-income communities bearing the brunt. Furthermore, the baby boomer generation, born between 1946 and 1964, is entering old age and leading to a rise in the retiree population. The number of citizens over the age of 65 is expected to rise by 24% by 2040. The aging trend contributes to individuals moving away from cities for a quieter and more affordable lifestyle into suburban areas, causing a significant population decline in US cities. As per a survey by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), 63% of retirees prioritize affordability when choosing where to live, while 58% value healthcare accessibility. Projections indicate that by 2029, retirees will outnumber children under the age of eighteen, resulting in more deaths than births in the coming years.', ""In addition, economic factors also contribute to depopulation in US cities. A 2023 report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition revealed that affording a two-bedroom apartment in San Francisco requires a median income of $99,190, while the city's median household income sits at $92,800. This inequality of income and cost of living is also seen in other major cities like Los Angeles, where the median home price reached a record $988,000 in 2023.\xa0These factors are pushing young professionals and families to seek more affordable living options elsewhere. Furthermore, Labor Statistics data highlighted that middle-wage jobs declined by 3.4 million between 2001 and 2022, while low-wage jobs increased by 3.7 million during the same period. This widening gap between job availability and income needs is driving residents to seek opportunities in areas with better employment prospects. Consequently, cities like San Francisco and New York are witnessing population decline, with a decrease of 5.3% and 7.5%, respectively, between 2020 and 2022."", 'With major US cities losing population, there will be negative implications for the US economy. Firstly, a smaller population will mean a smaller consumer base, impacting businesses across sectors. This could impact economic growth, given that consumer spending accounts for about 70% of the US GDP. A shrinking population in US cities will particularly affect the real estate market of cities. Reduced demand for housing, particularly in depopulating regions, could lead to vacant properties and declining property values. A Freddie Mac study revealed that home values in shrinking cities depreciated by an average of 2.7% annually, compared to a 3.8% appreciation in growing cities. You can also check out the 25 Cities Where Home Prices Are Falling Now here. The slowdown in the real estate market could also pose challenges for popular companies like American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), Prologis Inc. (NYSE:PLD), and Lennar Corp (NYSE:LEN).', 'Here’s what Baron Funds said about American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:', '“Early in 2023, we sold the majority of our position in\xa0American Tower Corporation\xa0(NYSE:AMT), a global operator of over 200,000 wireless towers, and even further reduced our modest position in the third quarter of 2023. We had concluded in late 2022 and early 2023 that growth expectations were too high given forthcoming headwinds from significantly higher financing costs (20%-plus exposure to floating rate debt), upcoming debt maturities, continued payment shortfalls from a key tenant in India, foreign exchange headwinds, and a reduction in mobile carrier capital expenditures.', 'Following a sharp decline in American Tower’s shares in the first nine months of 2023, we began rebuilding our position because we believed that the company’s shares had become more attractively valued, growth headwinds were better understood, and the potential monetization event of its India business would ultimately be value accretive to its business. Further, we believe that 2023 will mark the trough in earnings growth for American Tower and growth should reaccelerate in the next few years.”', 'A crowded Wall Street plaza, bustling with people carrying briefcases.', 'Our Methodology', ""To shortlist the 15 biggest US cities facing depopulation by 2100, we referred to a study conducted by researchers affiliated with the University of Chicago, Illinois, who employed US Census Data to project the potential shifts in city populations by 2100. Their analysis incorporated mathematical models to account for the influences of various scenarios. We also did a comparative analysis of the biggest cities' populations over both a five-year and a decade-long timespan. The average annual loss rate for the preceding years has also been included to provide a more comprehensive view of the overall trend.

Since then, the city has steadily lost residents, shrinking by 43% or 205,000 people as of the last census.

During the 1940s and 1950s, the city’s population exceeded 160,000 residents. However, by 2020, the population of Harford, CT had dropped to approximately 122,000. The major reasons behind this decline are the economic hardships faced by the city, suburbanization, outmigration of the middle class, and lack of investment in infrastructure.', 'Five-Year Change: -3.69%', 'Annual Loss Rate: -0.57%', 'The trend of population decline in Toledo, Ohio, is complex and has a long history. The city’s population peaked during the 1970s but has been declining since then. As a matter of fact, there has been about a 25% decline in the population of Toledo over the last five decades. This can be attributed to deindustrialization, suburbanization, and economic challenges faced by the city, causing people to migrate to other areas.

As of January 2024, Memphis' estimated population is 618,626, showing a decline of over 2% compared to the 2020 census count of 631,326. The main causes of this decrease in the city’s population are the high rates of poverty and crime as well as a tough job market. This has resulted in many people moving to other cities.

These stocks provide investors with a reliable and steadily growing income over time. Additionally, they have demonstrated resilience during economic challenges. As per a Hartford Funds report, companies that have increased or introduced dividends have consistently outperformed other stocks since 1973, especially when compared to those that reduced or eliminated their dividends. Notably, these dividend-paying stocks have exhibited higher returns with considerably lower volatility. This is why many financial experts are currently emphasizing the advantages of integrating dividend-paying stocks as a fundamental component of an equity portfolio when advising their clients.', 'A key driver behind the trend of companies initiating dividends lies in the aftermath of the financial crisis, where corporations experienced a surge in profits, leading to substantial growth in their balance sheets. Since the early 2000s, the cash reserves on corporate balance sheets have more than tripled. This surplus of cash provides corporations with versatile options, including expanding their operations or engaging in acquisitions. A notable choice for many companies has been to deploy the excess cash by either initiating a dividend program or augmenting existing dividend payouts. This strategic use of accumulated funds reflects a proactive approach by companies to enhance shareholder value and leverage their financial strength for sustained growth.', 'Two promising factors for dividend investors are the combination of strong corporate profits among S&P 500 companies and remarkably low payout ratios. According to a report by Hartford Funds, the historical average dividend payout ratio spanning 96 years has been 56.3%. However, as of December 31, 2022, the current payout ratio stands at a mere 37.1%, signifying a substantial gap with ample room for expansion. This presents a promising scenario for dividend investors, as companies appear to have considerable capacity to increase their dividend payouts, potentially leading to enhanced returns for investors in the foreseeable future.', ""In 2023, dividend stocks faced a period of underperformance as yields experienced a significant increase, primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate hikes. However, the outlook for income investing is anticipated to undergo a shift in 2024. With growing expectations for the Federal Reserve to either pause the rate hikes or potentially implement a cut, the dynamics of income investing are poised for a potential transformation. Portfolio Manager John Baldi, overseeing the ClearBridge Dividend Strategy, has expressed an optimistic perspective on dividend stocks for the year 2024. Here are some comments from the analyst:"", '“As a general overall market observation, the macro is highly unpredictable. We entered 2023 with expectations for a recession that was going to start in the back half of this year. We’ve just reported one of the strongest quarters of growth in the recent past.

But will these latest tensions affect oil stocks like Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM),\xa0 Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in 2024? Industry experts were anticipating a continued slowdown in oil prices in 2024 amid a weaker global economic growth. Latest data from the International Energy Agency said that oil demand in 2024 is expected to come in at 1.2 million barrels a day, down from 2.3 million barrels a day last year. Oil demand started to decline in the last quarter of 2023 following a decline in travel demand in China. Part of the reason why oil prices will remain subdued in 2024 is an oil supply surplus expected in the year, driven by record high supplies from the U.S., Brazil and Guyana, along with production increases from countries outside of OPEC+. Despite this, investors have a lot of to gain from the oil and gas industry as the world\'s economic growth and output is set to come back to normal in the long term. Paul Sankey from Sankey Research recently said while talking to CNBC that while attacks on oil tankers and ships in the Red sea did not cause a rise in oil prices, the fact that WTI crude oil was hovering in the range of $70s shows that prices are not that low and if WTI goes near $75 we are going to see ""very good cash returns"" from oil companies this year.', 'Sankey referred to BP CEO who said that the company was using $60 per barrel as its base price for estimates and planning.

The biggest factor in the marketwide rally is the tech sector -- specifically big tech -- where the market caps have gotten so large that a few companies alone can move the entire market.', 'There are currently five companies with a market capitalization of over $1 trillion: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. And there are just 12 companies with a market cap of over half a trillion dollars, which are those five plus Meta Platforms, Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla, Eli Lilly, Taiwan Semiconductor, Broadcom, and Visa.', ""It could take a while, but I believe that within the next three to five years, Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) will become the first company with over 50 consecutive annual dividend raises -- known as a Dividend King -- to surpass $500 billion in market value. Here's why P&G has what it takes to reach this milestone."", 'There are currently 54 Dividend Kings, but only seven of them have a market cap of around $200 billion or more.', 'Walmart is the leader with a $437 billion market value. It would need to gain just 14.4% to reach $500 billion. I like Walmart, but the rally since its last reported earnings has been largely unjustified. Walmart is dealing with a slew of challenges. And unlike its peer Target, which remains down over 47% from its all-time high, Walmart is down less than 5% from its all-time high.', 'Target has more of a consumer discretionary mix than Walmart, and it mismanaged its inventory and supply chain in recent times. However, the fact remains that Walmart is facing low growth. Its net income is virtually unchanged from 10 years ago, and its operating margin is relatively low as well.', ""After reporting fiscal 2024 third-quarter results in November, Walmart stock initially sold off before falling even further, to around $150 a share. It's been a sizable bounce since then for no real reason. Walmart is still a solid long-term holding for its recession resilience and growing dividend. But the above market valuation with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 27 leaves too much room for a sell-off."", 'P&G has to outperform Walmart by quite a bit to beat it to $500 billion in market value. But there are a few reasons it could pull this off.', 'P&G is generating practically as much free cash flow (FCF) as net income. Revenue growth has been solid, and its margins have held up despite a challenging operating environment. P&G has several partners and deals through different sales channels, so it can sustain higher margins than a pure-play retailer. Despite clocking in at a whopping $348 billion market cap, P&G is a lean business.', 'P&G routinely generates far more sales than it needs to run the business -- hence the high margins and FCF. It passes that cash flow to shareholders through a growing dividend and buybacks.', ""While dividends won't help P&G grow its market cap, they provide an incentive to hold a stock through periods of volatility. Not only is P&G one of the longest-tenured Dividend Kings, but its dividend also yields 2.6%, which is quite a bit higher than Walmart's 1.4%."", 'As for the buybacks, P&G has reduced its outstanding share count by 13% over the past decade compared to 16.6% for Walmart. Both companies have done an excellent job boosting earnings per share through buybacks, which has helped make both companies a better value when organic growth is sluggish.', 'P&G also looks like a far better value than Walmart. P&G sports a P/E ratio of 24 and a price-to-FCF ratio of 25.1. By comparison, Walmart has a P/E ratio of 26.9 and a price-to-FCF ratio of\xa034.6.', ""Coincidentally, Coca-Cola\xa0has an almost identical valuation to P&G, with a P/E ratio of 23.9 and a price-to-FCF ratio of 25.4. The difference is that Coke would have to nearly double to reach $500 billion in market size. Coke is a worthy dividend stock with a solid 3.1% yield. But when it comes to a race among Dividend Kings, it's just too small and similar to P&G to compete at this time."", ""It wouldn't surprise me if Walmart touched a $500 billion market cap before P&G on a whim of market exuberance.

The so-called ""cola wars"" have often influenced the beverage landscape as each company fought (through marketing) in more than 200 countries to build and expand its fan base.', ""And the competition between these two companies goes well beyond cola. Each owns numerous beverage brands, and PepsiCo also mixes in some popular snack food brands. But does that make it a better choice for today's investors? Let's take a closer look."", ""Today's PepsiCo is better described as a consumer conglomerate rather than a seller of cola drinks. Its beverages include familiar brands such as Aquafina, Gatorade, and Tropicana. With food, its ownership of Quaker Foods and Frito-Lay places Quaker Oats, Lay's, Doritos, and numerous other foods under its umbrella."", ""It is also a significant player in branding, with partnership agreements that include companies like Starbucks and Papa John's."", 'In the first three quarters of 2023, these products and branding deals helped it earn $64 billion in revenue, a 9% increase from the same period one year ago. That led to net income of almost $7.8 billion, which fell 7% from year-ago levels.', ""However, last year's earnings included a $3.3 billion gain on the sale of assets, offset by a $1.6 billion impairment on intangible assets. If not for those one-time occurrences, net income would have risen by 16% during the period."", 'Investors nonetheless punished the stock, and it fell slightly over the last year. But while its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 might appear high historically, the 21 forward P/E ratio is closer to historical lows, which could signal improving profit growth.', 'Lastly, investors should take note of the dividend, which has achieved Dividend King status after 51 years of increases. At $5.06 per share annually and a dividend yield of 3%, it is more than double the S&P 500 average of 1.4%. That rising stream of stable cash flow serves as a bonus for owning this stock.', ""Coca-Cola might have its archrival beat on the dividend front. Its streak of annual increases is up to 61 and its payout of $1.84 per share yields 3.1%. Also, one longtime beneficiary of this payout is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Its 9% stake in Coca-Cola amounts to 400 million shares, which paid Buffett's company $736 million in dividends in 2023, a 57% annual return on the original $1.3 billion investment."", ""New investors are unlikely to derive such returns from the beverage stock. Nor are they going to find foods in Coca-Cola's portfolio. Nonetheless, in addition to its flagship cola beverage, it owns about 200 master beverage brands. Among its better-known brands are Minute Maid, Topo Chico, Gold Peak, and Powerade."", ""In the first three quarters of 2023, these brands helped drive $35 billion in revenue, a 6% yearly gain. That led to $8.7 billion in net income during the period, a 16% gain from year-ago levels -- the same percentage of PepsiCo's growth when excluding one-time charges."", ""Also, like PepsiCo, Coca-Cola's stock experienced little net movement over the last year. And its P/E ratio of 24 is lower than its peer. However, when looking at forward P/Es, the forward multiple of 21 compares closely to PepsiCo, meaning the valuation differential might not be as much as the current P/E ratio implies."", 'The differences between PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are tiny. Both are diverse, well-established beverage stocks in a solid position to continue serving customers, meaning they should maintain steady dividends and stock growth. If someone is invested heavily in one of these stocks, the difference may not justify selling it and buying the other.', 'However, if choosing one, PepsiCo might have a slight edge. The expected increase in profits implied by the lower forward P/E ratio could give it a growth advantage for now, making it a better buy under current conditions.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PepsiCo wasn't one of them.

That's one reason why Warren Buffett has said that he will never sell its stock, and it's the reason the company can charge premium prices for drinks that are similar to those sold by its competitors."", ""But if you think Coca-Cola makes most of its business from selling Coke-branded beverages, you'd be mistaken."", ""Coca-Cola's core brand is the Coca-Cola in the red-labeled bottles or cans that you're certainly familiar with. It offers various takes on that trademark brand, such as Diet Coke and Cherry Coke, and it often comes up with new and limited-time flavors. These Coke products account for a large percentage of the company's total volume -- but not a majority."", 'So where does the majority of its business come from? Coca-Cola actually owns about 200 brands. It had owned about double that amount before the pandemic, but in recent years, it restructured and cut out a raft of underperforming brands that were eating up resources while accounting for low sales volumes.', 'Unlike rival PepsiCo, which has categories besides beverages, Coca-Cola deals strictly with drinks. However, Coca-Cola has several beverage categories: trademark Coca-Cola; other sparkling drinks; water, sports, coffee, and tea; and juice, value-added dairy, and plant-based drinks. It also has an ""emerging beverages"" category.', 'It would be easy for consumers to overlook that Coca-Cola owns so many of the brands that are going into their shopping carts. Among the other carbonated beverage brands in its portfolio are Fanta, Sprite, and Fresca. Vitamin Water and Powerade are some of its water and sports drink brands, and its juice and dairy names include Minute Maid and Fairlife. Among these brands, 26 are powerhouses in their own rights, each bringing in more than $1 billion in revenue annually.', ""The company doesn't break down those categories' sales by revenue, but by unit volume. Management explains in its filings that although total revenue isn't directly based on unit volume, it's an important indicator because it provides a clearer picture of consumer demand. In other words, total revenue is partially determined by pricing and partially by volume. The volume piece is the one that tells you what customers are buying."", 'In total, trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 46% of unit volume in 2022, and only 44% in the U.S.', 'Taken together, the other brands account for the majority of total unit volume. As strong as the Coke brand is, the company still relies on drinks like Fresca and Dasani to support its high sales volume and maintain its position as the top global beverage company.', ""But don't underestimate the importance of pricing power. Coca-Cola reported an 8% year-over-year sales increase in 2023's third quarter, but its unit case volume was only up 2%. Many companies reported similar revenue increases in the same period as they raised prices to compensate for rising costs."", 'Trademark Coca-Cola likely accounted for a high percentage of the revenue increase. Since the company can charge premium prices for this brand, it could still account for half or more of total revenue.', ""Coca-Cola puts a lot of effort into maintaining its trademark brand power, but it needs these other brands to keep its dominant position in the beverage market. In some regions, Coca-Cola enjoys extremely high brand recognition and accounts for more of the volume mix. In Latin America, for example, it's 57%. However, it only accounts for 33% in the Asia Pacific region."", 'Some of its newer brands are generating its highest growth. For example, Fairlife volumes increased by double-digit percentages annually for the past eight years. Coca-Cola identifies acquisition targets that will diversify its portfolio of brands and allow it to reach more customers in regions where people are looking for different kinds of beverages. The company can usually absorb new brands with high efficiency by leveraging its vast, unmatched distribution network. That brings in more sales with strong margins. ', ""It's a robust business cycle. Sales of its core trademark Coca-Cola drinks bring in tons of reliable cash, and the company uses that cash to purchase higher-growth brands whose sales trickle down to strengthen the bottom line. It also uses a large portion of its cash to reward shareholders with its storied dividend, creating shareholder satisfaction and confidence. It's no wonder Warren Buffett is such a huge fan.

The former provides gas and steam turbines that produce power from fossil fuels, and the latter provides onshore and offshore wind turbines. GE Vernova will face headwinds in both spaces. The transition to renewables will be a source of friction for the Power segment, and intense competition will be a source of friction for the Renewable Energy segment."", 'Conversely, GE Aerospace is operating from a position of strength. The company is a premier manufacturer of commercial jet engines, and it dominates the market in both manufactured products and maintenance services.', 'That means GE Aerospace is well positioned to benefit as air travel demand trends higher in the coming years. For context, global airline capacity only recently surpassed pre-COVID levels, according to Bloomberg.', ""Here is the bottom line: Last year, GE Aerospace grew sales more quickly, earned higher margins, and reported a larger profit than General Electric's Power and Renewable Energy segments. The makes the aviation business far more attractive than the energy business in my estimation, so I would not consider buying the stock until the separation is complete. At that point, I would reassess the situation based on the valuation of GE Aerospace."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them.

After that, there\'s a slew of non-tech-focused companies. I\'ll call them the ""Terrific 10,"" and they include Berkshire Hathaway, Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), JPMorgan Chase, UnitedHealth Group, Visa, Johnson & Johnson, ExxonMobil, Home Depot, Mastercard, and Procter & Gamble.', 'Together, they make up 10.9% of the S&P 500, not as much as the Magnificent Seven, but a sizable amount. The Terrific 10 are also the 10 largest S&P 500 components traded on the New York Stock Exchange, whereas the Magnificent Seven are all traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market.', ""Here's why the Terrific 10 can be a good bet for risk-averse investors and why the group stands a good chance of performing well during a recession."", ""What stands out about the Terrific 10 is that it includes three healthcare companies and four financial companies. Let's start with healthcare."", ""Healthcare is now the second most valuable sector of the S&P 500 behind tech, with financials at a very close third. Healthcare is known for its recession resistance since it is a basic need that isn't tied to the broader economy. But what may surprise you is the growth of top healthcare stocks."", 'Eli Lilly and UnitedHealth have crushed the S&P 500 over the last five-and 10-year periods. In fact, Eli Lilly is up nearly 1,000% over the last decade, a better return than Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms. UnitedHealth is nothing to scoff at either, posting an over 520% return.', ""Eli Lilly is a drugmaker, while UnitedHealth is an insurance provider. So, two different but lucrative businesses. Eli Lilly's weight loss drug, Zepbound, could become the best-selling drug in history. The excitement around the drug is a core reason behind Eli Lilly's soaring stock."", ""Eli Lilly investors are betting on future profits -- the stock has a 113.7 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. But UnitedHealth is much more of a value play. The stock is up big, but the earnings have grown, too. So even after UnitedHealth's incredible market outperformance, it still sports a lower P/E than the S&P 500 at just 21.1."", 'Referring back to the chart, Johnson & Johnson has drastically underperformed the market. But J&J is Dividend King with over 60 consecutive years of dividend raises and a 3% dividend yield.', 'The three healthcare stocks in the Terrific 10 give investors everything they could ask for -- growth from Eli Lilly, growth and value from UnitedHealth, and value and income from J&J.', ""Financials have always been a big part of the stock market. But the most valuable financial companies have changed. With a nearly $500 billion market cap, JPMorgan stands tall above the rest of the integrated banks. But after posting record earnings, it's still a good value and a reliable dividend stock with a 2.5% yield."", 'JPMorgan has asserted its dominance in recent years. But not long ago, JPMorgan was closer in market cap to Bank of America. And back in 2016, Wells Fargo was the largest of the four diversified banks.', 'It may shock you that Visa is actually more valuable than JPMorgan. Combined, Visa and Mastercard are worth nearly $1 trillion for a very simple reason -- effective business models.', 'Like clockwork, Visa and Mastercard make money off transactions. The more transactions, the more revenue. And as the economy grows, the volume and size of transactions continue to increase.', 'Visa and Mastercard have wide moats and stable inflows. But they also have impressive growth. Both stocks have roughly doubled over the last five years, but earnings have increased by a good amount, too.', 'There has been some valuation expansion, as Visa and Mastercard fetch higher than historic P/E multiples. But overall, these are quality businesses that are OK to pay up for.', 'Berkshire Hathaway is technically in the financial sector, given its conglomerate of insurance businesses. But Berkshire is much more than just insurance. It owns dozens of publicly traded stocks, with nearly half of that portfolio in Apple. But it also owns BNSF railroad and 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. It also generates a ton of profit from its manufacturing, service, and retailing business.', 'All told, Berkshire Hathaway gives investors a bit of everything.', 'Rounding out the Terrific 10 are three exceptional dividend stocks, two of which are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in Home Depot and P&G, while ExxonMobil was in the Dow until 2020.', 'Home Depot is cyclical. Its earnings benefit from strong consumer spending and a growing housing market. The housing market could be a surprise winner in 2024. But beyond that, Home Depot is a stable business that generates plenty of cash to support its growing dividend, even if the economy enters a recession. Home Depot yields 2.3%.', 'ExxonMobil is similar in that it is cyclical and benefits from high oil and gas prices. But the company has used outsize profits in recent years to pay off debt to the point where the balance sheet is now in its best shape in over a decade. Exxon has a plan to increase net income by $14 billion by 2027 based on a conservative Brent crude oil price of $60 per barrel. In this vein, Exxon has a large margin of error to be able to grow its business, buy back stock, and increase the dividend (as it has done for 41 consecutive years). ExxonMobil has the highest yield of the Terrific 10 at 3.9%.', ""Procter & Gamble is the safest of the Terrific 10 companies. As a consumer staples company, P&G isn't all that affected by a weak economy. It has pricing power, stable inflows, and generates plenty of extra cash to buy back a ton of stock and raise its dividend -- which it has done for 67 consecutive years. P&G's top brands, paired with its exposure to different consumer categories make it arguably the single safest dividend stock in the entire S&P 500. P&G yields 2.6%."", ""The hype surrounding the Magnificent Seven has been largely justified, given the growth potential and positioning of these top companies. But as we've discussed, there has been plenty of leadership in other market sectors, too."", 'The Terrific 10 contains a nice balance of growth, value, and income.

So did Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), which is currently the most valuable U.S.-based company, sitting at a $3.009 trillion market cap --\xa0ever so slightly above Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) $3.002 trillion market cap."", ""The race for the most valuable company in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite is straightforward. But in the Dow, it's a little more complicated. Let's discuss these market dynamics and why, despite an uphill battle, Microsoft could eventually become the most important stock in the Dow."", ""The S&P 500 consists of the 500 largest U.S.-based companies. This is an important distinction, because there are some massive companies you can buy through ADRs on U.S. exchanges, but they aren't in the S&P 500. A noteworthy example is Taiwan Semiconductor, which would be one of the ten largest companies in the S&P 500 if it were based in the U.S."", 'The Nasdaq Composite is a bit different, because ADRs are fair game. However, a company must be listed on the Nasdaq exchange, whereas the S&P 500 includes companies listed on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.', 'In both indexes, the most valuable companies have the highest weighting. Both U.S.-based, Nasdaq-listed stocks, Microsoft and Apple are the highest-weighted components of both indexes. Microsoft and Apple also happen to be components of the Dow.', ""But unlike the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, the Dow is a price-weighted index. The rather arbitrary quality of a stock's price dictates its weight. In 2020, Apple split its stock on a four-for-one basis. So although it holds a nearly identical market cap to Microsoft, its stock price is far lower, and it is more of an average-weighted Dow stock."", 'UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH), with a stock price over $500, is currently the highest-weighted stock in the Dow. Second is Microsoft, which is knocking on the door of $400 a share. And a close third is Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE: GS), which is at $382 a share.', 'Just three weeks into the year, Microsoft is up 6% while Goldman is down slightly, and United Health has lost over 4%.', ""At this rate, Microsoft looks like it's within striking distance of catching UnitedHealth to become the most valuable stock in the Dow. But a few challenges are standing in its way."", ""As of the time of this writing, Microsoft would have to go up another 26.3% to tie the price of UnitedHealth. It sounds feasible, seeing as Microsoft gained 56.8% in 2023. But to get to over $500 a share, Microsoft would have to gain another $750 billion in value. That's more than the entire value of Tesla, not to mention UnitedHealth."", ""Large companies benefit from their size. It makes it easier to outlast an economic downturn, achieve diversification, buy out competitors, and more.\xa0But it's harder to steer a giant ship than a smaller one. The larger Microsoft gets, the more difficult it will be for the stock to gain."", ""There's also the likelihood that UnitedHealth gains some ground too. The stock is down over 10% from its all-time high. And because UnitedHealth is so much smaller than Microsoft from a market cap perspective, it's easier to gain that ground back. Again, the laws of physics are working against Microsoft here."", ""Goldman Sachs may pose an even greater threat than UnitedHealth. Its market cap is just $124.6 billion, less than 5% of Microsoft's size and less than a third of UnitedHealth's."", ""To be safe, I would say Microsoft has to gain another $1 trillion in market cap, which would be a 35% return and put it around $540 a share. Then again, UnitedHealth could always give up more ground and make the task easier for Microsoft. But to hold a commanding lead in the Dow, I'm going to pencil in the $4 trillion level as the next step for Microsoft."", ""The biggest risk for Microsoft missing its chance to be the most valuable stock in the Dow is a stock split. Over the last five years, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, and Nvidia have all split their stocks. Microsoft, on the other hand, hasn't split its stock in over 20 years."", ""It's been a recent resurgence for Microsoft. Just five years ago, it was hovering around $100 a share. And it wasn't until late 2019 that it passed $1 trillion in market capitalization."", ""History says that Microsoft won't split its stock. But in light of so many gains that have come in recent years, I wouldn't be surprised if management chose that path."", ""It's important to remember that a stock split doesn't affect weighting in the S&P 500 or Nasdaq, since those are market cap-weighted indices. But it does in the Dow."", ""Companies split their stocks for various reasons, the simplest being that a stock split provides a lower entry point. Psychologically, it also makes a nominal increase seem smaller. A stock price jumping from $2.90 to $4 a share doesn't seem like a big deal. But $2,900 a share to $4,000 a share seems huge. A stock split makes it easier to wrap our heads around prices."", 'The race for the highest-weighted stock in the Dow seems more like gamesmanship than anything. But it does have its impacts.', ""The S&P 500 is more tech-heavy than ever, with nearly 30% of the index allocated to tech. The Invesco QQQ ETF, which includes the 100 highest-weighted components of the Nasdaq Composite, is 57.1% in tech. As per the name, the Dow was historically meant to represent the industrial sector. It hasn't been that way for a while. But it's safe to say that sector balance is important in the Dow."", 'The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF, which mirrors the performance of the Dow, has sector weightings of 20.9% in financials, 19.7% in tech, and 19.4% in healthcare. A big part of that composition is due to the high weights of Goldman Sachs, UnitedHealth, and Microsoft. Meanwhile, the industrial sector is just 14.1%.', ""If tech continues to make up a larger share of the economy, then it stands to reason it should make up a larger share of the Dow as well. However, investors should be mindful of what these indexes contain and how they have changed so they don't wrongfully compare their portfolios to an inaccurate benchmark."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$806.7m', 'US$1.73b', 'US$2.56b', 'US$2.68b', 'US$3.04b', 'US$3.30b', 'US$3.53b', 'US$3.72b', 'US$3.88b', 'US$4.03b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x8', 'Analyst x11', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 8.72%', 'Est @ 6.77%', 'Est @ 5.40%', 'Est @ 4.45%', 'Est @ 3.78%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% ', 'US$747', 'US$1.5k', 'US$2.0k', 'US$2.0k', 'US$2.1k', 'US$2.1k', 'US$2.1k', 'US$2.0k', 'US$1.9k', 'US$1.9k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18b', ""The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage.

After that, there\'s a slew of non-tech-focused companies. I\'ll call them the ""Terrific 10,"" and they include Berkshire Hathaway, Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), JPMorgan Chase, UnitedHealth Group, Visa, Johnson & Johnson, ExxonMobil, Home Depot, Mastercard, and Procter & Gamble.', 'Together, they make up 10.9% of the S&P 500, not as much as the Magnificent Seven, but a sizable amount. The Terrific 10 are also the 10 largest S&P 500 components traded on the New York Stock Exchange, whereas the Magnificent Seven are all traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market.', ""Here's why the Terrific 10 can be a good bet for risk-averse investors and why the group stands a good chance of performing well during a recession."", ""What stands out about the Terrific 10 is that it includes three healthcare companies and four financial companies. Let's start with healthcare."", ""Healthcare is now the second most valuable sector of the S&P 500 behind tech, with financials at a very close third. Healthcare is known for its recession resistance since it is a basic need that isn't tied to the broader economy. But what may surprise you is the growth of top healthcare stocks."", 'Eli Lilly and UnitedHealth have crushed the S&P 500 over the last five-and 10-year periods. In fact, Eli Lilly is up nearly 1,000% over the last decade, a better return than Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms. UnitedHealth is nothing to scoff at either, posting an over 520% return.', ""Eli Lilly is a drugmaker, while UnitedHealth is an insurance provider. So, two different but lucrative businesses. Eli Lilly's weight loss drug, Zepbound, could become the best-selling drug in history. The excitement around the drug is a core reason behind Eli Lilly's soaring stock."", ""Eli Lilly investors are betting on future profits -- the stock has a 113.7 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. But UnitedHealth is much more of a value play. The stock is up big, but the earnings have grown, too. So even after UnitedHealth's incredible market outperformance, it still sports a lower P/E than the S&P 500 at just 21.1."", 'Referring back to the chart, Johnson & Johnson has drastically underperformed the market. But J&J is Dividend King with over 60 consecutive years of dividend raises and a 3% dividend yield.', 'The three healthcare stocks in the Terrific 10 give investors everything they could ask for -- growth from Eli Lilly, growth and value from UnitedHealth, and value and income from J&J.', ""Financials have always been a big part of the stock market. But the most valuable financial companies have changed. With a nearly $500 billion market cap, JPMorgan stands tall above the rest of the integrated banks. But after posting record earnings, it's still a good value and a reliable dividend stock with a 2.5% yield."", 'JPMorgan has asserted its dominance in recent years. But not long ago, JPMorgan was closer in market cap to Bank of America. And back in 2016, Wells Fargo was the largest of the four diversified banks.', 'It may shock you that Visa is actually more valuable than JPMorgan. Combined, Visa and Mastercard are worth nearly $1 trillion for a very simple reason -- effective business models.', 'Like clockwork, Visa and Mastercard make money off transactions. The more transactions, the more revenue. And as the economy grows, the volume and size of transactions continue to increase.', 'Visa and Mastercard have wide moats and stable inflows. But they also have impressive growth. Both stocks have roughly doubled over the last five years, but earnings have increased by a good amount, too.', 'There has been some valuation expansion, as Visa and Mastercard fetch higher than historic P/E multiples. But overall, these are quality businesses that are OK to pay up for.', 'Berkshire Hathaway is technically in the financial sector, given its conglomerate of insurance businesses. But Berkshire is much more than just insurance. It owns dozens of publicly traded stocks, with nearly half of that portfolio in Apple. But it also owns BNSF railroad and 92% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. It also generates a ton of profit from its manufacturing, service, and retailing business.', 'All told, Berkshire Hathaway gives investors a bit of everything.', 'Rounding out the Terrific 10 are three exceptional dividend stocks, two of which are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in Home Depot and P&G, while ExxonMobil was in the Dow until 2020.', 'Home Depot is cyclical. Its earnings benefit from strong consumer spending and a growing housing market. The housing market could be a surprise winner in 2024. But beyond that, Home Depot is a stable business that generates plenty of cash to support its growing dividend, even if the economy enters a recession. Home Depot yields 2.3%.', 'ExxonMobil is similar in that it is cyclical and benefits from high oil and gas prices. But the company has used outsize profits in recent years to pay off debt to the point where the balance sheet is now in its best shape in over a decade. Exxon has a plan to increase net income by $14 billion by 2027 based on a conservative Brent crude oil price of $60 per barrel. In this vein, Exxon has a large margin of error to be able to grow its business, buy back stock, and increase the dividend (as it has done for 41 consecutive years). ExxonMobil has the highest yield of the Terrific 10 at 3.9%.', ""Procter & Gamble is the safest of the Terrific 10 companies. As a consumer staples company, P&G isn't all that affected by a weak economy. It has pricing power, stable inflows, and generates plenty of extra cash to buy back a ton of stock and raise its dividend -- which it has done for 67 consecutive years. P&G's top brands, paired with its exposure to different consumer categories make it arguably the single safest dividend stock in the entire S&P 500. P&G yields 2.6%."", ""The hype surrounding the Magnificent Seven has been largely justified, given the growth potential and positioning of these top companies. But as we've discussed, there has been plenty of leadership in other market sectors, too."", 'The Terrific 10 contains a nice balance of growth, value, and income. It may be a good choice for investors who already have a lot of exposure to tech and are looking to diversify.

And there are just 12 companies with a market cap of over half a trillion dollars, which are those five plus Meta Platforms, Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla, Eli Lilly, Taiwan Semiconductor, Broadcom, and Visa.', ""It could take a while, but I believe that within the next three to five years, Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) will become the first company with over 50 consecutive annual dividend raises -- known as a Dividend King -- to surpass $500 billion in market value. Here's why P&G has what it takes to reach this milestone."", 'There are currently 54 Dividend Kings, but only seven of them have a market cap of around $200 billion or more.', 'Walmart is the leader with a $437 billion market value. It would need to gain just 14.4% to reach $500 billion. I like Walmart, but the rally since its last reported earnings has been largely unjustified. Walmart is dealing with a slew of challenges. And unlike its peer Target, which remains down over 47% from its all-time high, Walmart is down less than 5% from its all-time high.', 'Target has more of a consumer discretionary mix than Walmart, and it mismanaged its inventory and supply chain in recent times. However, the fact remains that Walmart is facing low growth. Its net income is virtually unchanged from 10 years ago, and its operating margin is relatively low as well.', ""After reporting fiscal 2024 third-quarter results in November, Walmart stock initially sold off before falling even further, to around $150 a share. It's been a sizable bounce since then for no real reason. Walmart is still a solid long-term holding for its recession resilience and growing dividend. But the above market valuation with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 27 leaves too much room for a sell-off."", 'P&G has to outperform Walmart by quite a bit to beat it to $500 billion in market value. But there are a few reasons it could pull this off.', 'P&G is generating practically as much free cash flow (FCF) as net income. Revenue growth has been solid, and its margins have held up despite a challenging operating environment. P&G has several partners and deals through different sales channels, so it can sustain higher margins than a pure-play retailer. Despite clocking in at a whopping $348 billion market cap, P&G is a lean business.', 'P&G routinely generates far more sales than it needs to run the business -- hence the high margins and FCF. It passes that cash flow to shareholders through a growing dividend and buybacks.', ""While dividends won't help P&G grow its market cap, they provide an incentive to hold a stock through periods of volatility. Not only is P&G one of the longest-tenured Dividend Kings, but its dividend also yields 2.6%, which is quite a bit higher than Walmart's 1.4%."", 'As for the buybacks, P&G has reduced its outstanding share count by 13% over the past decade compared to 16.6% for Walmart. Both companies have done an excellent job boosting earnings per share through buybacks, which has helped make both companies a better value when organic growth is sluggish.', 'P&G also looks like a far better value than Walmart. P&G sports a P/E ratio of 24 and a price-to-FCF ratio of 25.1. By comparison, Walmart has a P/E ratio of 26.9 and a price-to-FCF ratio of\xa034.6.', ""Coincidentally, Coca-Cola\xa0has an almost identical valuation to P&G, with a P/E ratio of 23.9 and a price-to-FCF ratio of 25.4. The difference is that Coke would have to nearly double to reach $500 billion in market size. Coke is a worthy dividend stock with a solid 3.1% yield. But when it comes to a race among Dividend Kings, it's just too small and similar to P&G to compete at this time."", ""It wouldn't surprise me if Walmart touched a $500 billion market cap before P&G on a whim of market exuberance. But in terms of which company will surpass that market cap and stay above the threshold, I think no Dividend King holds a candle to P&G."", 'P&G is, in many ways, a perfect business. There is almost nothing not to like about it. Despite improving fundamentals, the stock has gone practically nowhere over the last year and is down around 10% from its all-time high. That makes it stand out as a buying opportunity.', ""It may take three to five years, but it wouldn't surprise me one bit if P&G gains at least 43% to surpass $500 billion in market value -- all while rewarding its shareholders handsomely with predictable buybacks and a growing dividend."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Procter & Gamble right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Procter & Gamble, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Procter & Gamble wasn't one of them.

The primary objective of investing in these stocks is to generate a steady income, making it a top priority for investors. Dividends can serve as indicators of a company's financial strength.

As per findings from Franklin Templeton, companies in the S&P 500 that consistently increased or initiated dividends experienced a positive return of 8.58% over the 30-year period ending in December 2022.

Management's mid-January earnings update contained good news regarding sales and earnings trends. The fiscal Q2 report showed that organic sales are on track to expand at a decent clip following big gains last year. Profits are rising at an even faster pace thanks to price increases along with the consumer staples giant's stellar operating efficiency."", ""Those factors all suggest that P&G stock can beat the market in 2024 after trailing the Dow Jones Industrial Average this past year. Moreover, investors should be even more excited about the company's prospects for boosting its dividend in just a few months."", ""Dividend increases are ultimately driven by operating and financial momentum, and that is proving to be strong heading into the second half of P&G's fiscal year. Sure, organic sales rose 4% in Q2 to mark a slowdown compared to the prior quarter's 7% spike."", 'Yet, it was a relief for Wall Street to learn that sales volume trends remained steady through late December. P&G also confirmed its wider sales outlook and boosted its 2024 earnings forecast. ""We delivered strong results in the second quarter, enabling us to raise our core EPS growth guidance and maintain our top-line outlook,"" CEO Jon Moeller said in a press release.', ""P&G's profits are much stronger than they might appear at first glance. While reported earnings in Q2 dropped 12%, that slump was driven by one-time restructuring charges. Strip out those factors and gross profit margin was up a robust 6 percentage points."", 'Operating profit margin jumped by 5 percentage points as well to keep P&G well ahead of peers like Kimberly-Clark. Cash flow productivity, a big priority for management, is trending well above its goal of 90%. P&G converted 95% of adjusted earnings into free cash flow this past quarter. All of these factors should make it easier for executives to decide on a relatively generous dividend hike for the 2024.', 'P&G usually announces its annual dividend increase in April, around the time that it reports fiscal Q3 results. Last year, the hike was a modest 3%, but there were some key differences in the fiscal 2023 operating trends. Organic sales were on track to rise by about the same 5% that management is expecting this year. But earnings were forecast to climb by just 6% back then due to soaring costs for raw materials and transportation.', 'In contrast, P&G just upgraded its profit outlook to call for between 8% and 9% growth in fiscal 2024. Assuming those positive trends hold through the fiscal third quarter, investors might expect to see a modestly bigger dividend boost of closer to 4% or 5% this April.', ""In any case, it's almost assured that P&G will announce its 68th consecutive annual payout increase in a few short months. That streak is one of the longest on the market and reflects its dominant industry position in dozens of product categories, ranging from paper towels to laundry detergent, that consumers use daily."", ""The next increase will be a great reason to like the stock, but income investors don't have to wait until it is announced before establishing a position in P&G shares for 2024 and beyond."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Procter & Gamble right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Procter & Gamble, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Procter & Gamble wasn't one of them.

Read on to see why five Motley Fool contributors think Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA), NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP), Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI), and the brand-new Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) stand out as excellent investments right now."", ""Daniel Foelber (Tesla): After a year of price cuts and margin compression, Tesla investors were hoping for a turnaround in 2024. That's not what they got on the company's fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call, which included muted guidance for the year on top of an overall weak quarter."", ""Revenue growth was just 3% year over year, operating income fell to $2.1 billion, and the operating margin was 8.2%. For comparison, Tesla's operating income was $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, and its operating margin was 16%."", 'High operating margins have been a differentiating factor for Tesla and a key reason for its premium valuation. Since its margins have been cut in half, it would have to double its revenue to get the same operating income as it did in the 2022 fourth quarter. The ideal scenario is sustaining a relatively high operating margin and growing revenue. But both revenue growth and margins look to be disappointing for a while.', ""Management made it clear on the earnings call that while its vehicles are a good value, they are simply more expensive than the most popular mass-produced vehicles like the Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic. It's harder for consumers to justify paying more when the monthly payment is higher due to high interest rates. And yet, Tesla's Model Y was still the best-selling vehicle (not just EV) in the world last year."", 'The company is doing a good job with what it can control: cost management. Costs per vehicle declined in the fourth quarter, and Tesla is confident it can find further savings in 2024.', 'Specifically, costs per vehicle are falling by about 2% per quarter or around 10% per year. Cost of goods sold per vehicle was just above $36,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to over $39,000 a year earlier.', 'Elon Musk sees Tesla as an artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics company, not just a car company. Responding to his post on X that he was ""uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI and robotics,"" Musk clarified that it\'s not about the economic gain of having more shares, but about the voting control to ensure Tesla can grow in AI and robotics without a hostile takeover by an institutional service to take control of the powerful technology.', ""He proposed the idea of a dual-class stock to improve voting control and make the company more secure. From the comments, it doesn't seem that Musk wants to take his AI interests elsewhere but rather wants to ensure the company's governance is intact as innovation becomes irreversible."", 'Overall, Tesla seems to be doing a good job investing in its near-term and long-term growth. The company should be able to take market share during a prolonged downturn. And if interest rates do come down, it could see a noticeable uptick in demand.', ""The long-term investment thesis is intact, so Tesla looks like a good buy, especially if the market overreacts and there's a steep sell-off."", ""Anders Bylund (Bitcoin ETFs): At long last, investors finally have access to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the live market price of Bitcoin.

If so, you can stop reading here and move on to a more traditional stock recommendation."", ""You would be in great company. Warren Buffett will probably never own the tiniest sliver of a Bitcoin. Vanguard founder Jack Bogle swore off cryptocurrencies in his lifetime, and the fund-manager firm he created has sworn off the entire crypto industry. It's hard to bet against these investing geniuses. I get it."", ""If you're still reading, maybe you disagree with Vanguard's and Buffett's crypto-free philosophies.

On the contrary, it will still be growing it, albeit at a slower pace for now, and only because it wants to ensure that it can pay out dividends at a sustainable level even in a difficult business environment."", 'While many expected things to get even worse for NextEra Energy Partners, the company just released its fourth-quarter numbers and assured investors that it can raise its dividend by an average of 5% to 8% through 2026, including a 6% raise for 2024.

The company is set to announce its Q4 financial results in early February, likely closing out a strong year for revenue and earnings growth. Most Wall Street pros are looking for organic sales to post a double-digit gain for the period, in fact.', ""That announcement will include details on Pepsi's dividend hike for 2024, which could be significant. Let's take a closer look at just how big of an increase could be on tap for income investors this year."", ""PepsiCo is heading into the fiscal 2024 year with solid growth momentum. Revenue should rise by 10% in fiscal 2023, management said in mid-October, on top of the snack and beverage giant's 14% organic sales spike in 2022."", ""Along with slightly slower growth, this year's sales trends relied much more on rising profits as well. Volumes were down through the first three quarters of the year as shoppers reacted to higher prices by scaling back on their purchases somewhat."", 'As a result, Pepsi executives might be a bit less optimistic about the chances for faster sales gains ahead in 2024, adding caution to the dividend outlook.', ""On the bright side, earnings and cash flow are jumping thanks to the combination of cost cuts, price increases, and a demand tilt toward sparkling waters and energy drinks, which carry higher profit margins. Pepsi's operating profit margin expanded in the most recent quarter and per share earnings were up a blazing 16%. Operating cash flow improved by more than $1 billion to $7.6 billion through the first three quarters of the year."", 'Management is targeting 13% higher profits for its fiscal 2023 year, and that forecast was recently boosted from the prior 12% prediction. For context, earnings rose 11% in fiscal 2022. ""We believe we are well-positioned to adapt and execute in a dynamic consumer environment,"" CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a conference call with analysts.', 'These financial metrics imply another big dividend raise ahead in 2024, potentially approaching the 10% hike that management announced a year ago. While sales trends are weaker heading into the Q4 report, Pepsi is generating more cash and higher profits, even as it spends aggressively on growth initiatives like marketing.', ""The big question is how management sees consumer spending patterns holding up in 2024, and investors won't know those details until they review Pepsi's official outlook for the fiscal year. It's also possible that executives choose to return more cash to investors through stock buybacks instead of dividend payments this year after spending several years focused mainly on dividend growth."", ""In any case, Pepsi is almost certain to announce a significant dividend increase as part of its early February earnings update. This likely raise would be the company's 52nd consecutive annual increase, keeping it a member of the exclusive club of Dividend Kings that have boosted their payouts for at least 50 straight years."", ""Few companies can claim that kind of multi-decade streak, especially in the consumer staples industry.

But what exactly are quality stocks? Billionaire Cliff Asness, Andrea Frazzini, and Lasse H. Pedersen wrote a research paper in 2013 titled ""Quality Minus Junk"" in which they defined quality stocks as follows:', '""We define a quality security as one that has characteristics that, all-else-equal, an investor should be willing to pay a higher price for: stocks that are safe, profitable, growing, and well managed. High quality stocks do have higher prices on average, but not by a very large margin. Perhaps because of this puzzlingly modest impact of quality on price, high-quality stocks have high risk-adjusted returns. Indeed, a quality-minus-junk (QMJ) factor that goes long high-quality stocks and shorts low-quality stocks earns significant risk-adjusted returns in the U.S. and globally across 24 countries. The price of quality – i.e., how much investors pay extra for higher quality stocks – varies over time, reaching a low during the internet bubble.""', 'While the market is expecting rate cuts this year, rising geopolitical tensions and a persistent inflation is keeping the demand for quality stocks higher. Almost all notable investment firms including Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs recommended investors to buy high quality names for 2024. Why? \xa0High-quality stocks tend to perform better when growth is slowing down. A latest Wall Street Journal report quoted data from UBS which said the MSCI ACWI Quality Index has beaten the MSCI’s global index by 1 percentage point over six-month periods in which the economic growth slowed.', 'The research paper from Cliff Asness we mentioned earlier also talked about the returns of quality stocks during troubled times:', '""Our results present a puzzle for asset pricing. They are consistent with quality stocks being underpriced and junk stocks overpriced or, alternatively, with quality stocks being riskier than junk stocks. However, while one can never rule out a risk explanation for the high return of quality stocks, we are unable to identify this risk; in anything, we find evidence of the opposite. We show that quality stocks are low beta and, rather than exhibiting crash risk, if anything they benefit from “flight to quality,” that is, they have a tendency to perform well during periods of extreme market distress. These findings present a challenge for risk-based explanations where bad states of the world are negatively correlated to extreme return realizations of the market factor. Finally, we show that the price of quality varies over time, generating a time-varying expected return on quality-minus-junk portfolios: a low price of quality predicts a high future return of quality stocks relative to junk stocks.""', 'Photo by Adam Nowakowski on Unsplash', 'Methodology', 'For this article we first listed down all holdings of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF with PE ratios less than 30 as of January 26.

Each owns numerous beverage brands, and PepsiCo also mixes in some popular snack food brands. But does that make it a better choice for today's investors? Let's take a closer look."", ""Today's PepsiCo is better described as a consumer conglomerate rather than a seller of cola drinks. Its beverages include familiar brands such as Aquafina, Gatorade, and Tropicana. With food, its ownership of Quaker Foods and Frito-Lay places Quaker Oats, Lay's, Doritos, and numerous other foods under its umbrella."", ""It is also a significant player in branding, with partnership agreements that include companies like Starbucks and Papa John's."", 'In the first three quarters of 2023, these products and branding deals helped it earn $64 billion in revenue, a 9% increase from the same period one year ago. That led to net income of almost $7.8 billion, which fell 7% from year-ago levels.', ""However, last year's earnings included a $3.3 billion gain on the sale of assets, offset by a $1.6 billion impairment on intangible assets.

And its P/E ratio of 24 is lower than its peer. However, when looking at forward P/Es, the forward multiple of 21 compares closely to PepsiCo, meaning the valuation differential might not be as much as the current P/E ratio implies."", 'The differences between PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are tiny. Both are diverse, well-established beverage stocks in a solid position to continue serving customers, meaning they should maintain steady dividends and stock growth. If someone is invested heavily in one of these stocks, the difference may not justify selling it and buying the other.', 'However, if choosing one, PepsiCo might have a slight edge.

But what exactly are quality stocks? Billionaire Cliff Asness, Andrea Frazzini, and Lasse H. Pedersen wrote a research paper in 2013 titled ""Quality Minus Junk"" in which they defined quality stocks as follows:', '""We define a quality security as one that has characteristics that, all-else-equal, an investor should be willing to pay a higher price for: stocks that are safe, profitable, growing, and well managed. High quality stocks do have higher prices on average, but not by a very large margin. Perhaps because of this puzzlingly modest impact of quality on price, high-quality stocks have high risk-adjusted returns. Indeed, a quality-minus-junk (QMJ) factor that goes long high-quality stocks and shorts low-quality stocks earns significant risk-adjusted returns in the U.S. and globally across 24 countries. The price of quality – i.e., how much investors pay extra for higher quality stocks – varies over time, reaching a low during the internet bubble.""', 'While the market is expecting rate cuts this year, rising geopolitical tensions and a persistent inflation is keeping the demand for quality stocks higher.

They are consistent with quality stocks being underpriced and junk stocks overpriced or, alternatively, with quality stocks being riskier than junk stocks. However, while one can never rule out a risk explanation for the high return of quality stocks, we are unable to identify this risk; in anything, we find evidence of the opposite. We show that quality stocks are low beta and, rather than exhibiting crash risk, if anything they benefit from “flight to quality,” that is, they have a tendency to perform well during periods of extreme market distress. These findings present a challenge for risk-based explanations where bad states of the world are negatively correlated to extreme return realizations of the market factor.

(NASDAQ:GILD):', '“In the second half of 2023 — as we were selling low-growth, high-multiple stocks and taking advantage of oversold conditions in infrastructure, real estate and utilities — we also found opportunities in overlooked areas of health care. After adding\xa0Gilead Sciences, Inc.\xa0(NASDAQ:GILD) in the third quarter, we bought AstraZeneca in the fourth quarter. Each of these stocks present distinct investment cases, but both are reasonably valued and have limited patent expiry or pipeline risk. Gilead’s strength comes from its dominant franchise in HIV. It offers lower growth, but it yields nearly 4% and trades at 11x earnings. AstraZeneca possesses a diversified portfolio of pharmaceuticals, which should deliver double-digit earnings growth, yet it trades at just 16x earnings.

Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index.
