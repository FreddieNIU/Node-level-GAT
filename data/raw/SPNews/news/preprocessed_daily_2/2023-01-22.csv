Welcome to Huntington Bancshares Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Tim Sedabres, Director of Investor Relations.Tim Sedabres: Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone, and good morning. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing today can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.huntington.com. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and a replay will be available starting about 1 hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer; Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer, will join us for the Q&amp;A. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statements disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me now turn it over to Steve.Steve Steinour: Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We are very pleased to announce our fourth quarter results, which included GAAP net income of $645 million and adjusted net income of $657 million. For the full year, reported GAAP net income was $2.2 billion, and adjusted net income was $2.3 billion. Both results reflect record earnings for Huntington. 2022 marked a year of numerous successes driven by our team's execution of organic growth initiatives, realization of both expense and revenue synergies from the TCF acquisition. An unwavering focus on credit discipline and proactive balance sheet management. We ended the year with substantial momentum. Clearly, the economic environment is becoming increasingly challenging.However, Huntington is better positioned today than at any time since I joined over a dozen years ago. And over those years, we've transformed the risk profile of the bank and remained highly disciplined. We are taking proactive steps now to again position Huntington to outperform, and we entered the year with solid capital levels, top-tier reserves, a growing core deposit base and strong credit metrics. We continue to see opportunities to grow revenue and profit. Now on to Slide 4. First, we finished the year with our fourth consecutive quarter of record pre-provision net revenue. This was supported by higher interest income driven by earning asset growth and an expanded net interest margin. Revenue growth has been exceptional over the course of the year, and we intend to protect and grow that revenue base.Story continuesSecond, we delivered broad-based loan growth ex PPP up 10% year-over-year. As we drove this growth, we also optimized for return while still exceeding our loan growth outlook. One example of this optimization is indirect auto, where our production in the quarter was approximately 15% lower than the prior quarter, while our new loan yields increased by over 100 basis points. Importantly, we continue to grow our deposit base with multiple consecutive quarters of growth. We believe this is a differentiator for Huntington in this environment. It also demonstrates the breadth of our franchise and our colleagues' ability to acquire and deepen primary bank customer relationships. Third, our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year reflect a top-tier return profile and were at or above our medium-term targets.These results demonstrate the earnings power of the company, and we expect to continue to deliver on these targets. As we intended, we delivered common equity Tier 1 capital to the middle of our 9% to 10% operating range. We are also very pleased to announce a new 2-year share repurchase program. Fourth, we ended '22 with strong momentum across the business that we carry into this new year. We remain focused on growth, aligned with our risk appetite. Importantly, we have the capital, credit reserves and strength of balance sheet that give us confidence to continue to deliver on our organic growth priorities. Slide 5 highlights the tremendous earnings power of the franchise, which has improved sequentially over the course of the year. PPNR is over 60% higher than pre-pandemic levels.Our return on tangible common equity is top tier. We managed our asset sensitivity throughout the year and deliberately positioned the company to benefit from higher interest rates, which resulted in significant revenue growth. We've also been prudent in taking actions to protect this revenue base should we experience lower rates over the next few years. We will continue to be dynamic in this regard with our goal of reducing volatility and creating a tight quarter around the path of spread revenue. At our Investor Day in November, we shared with you our highly defined set of strategic priorities. We expect these strategies will drive sustained revenue growth and support gains in efficiency over the long term. As you also heard, this management team is a group of experienced operators.To further accelerate the execution of these strategies and support increased efficiency, we will be taking a series of actions during '23 to align our organizational structure with a focus on our critical priorities. We expect these actions will result in new growth and efficiency opportunities. We will share more details on these actions as they're finalized over the course of the first quarter However, one element will be a voluntary retirement program for our middle and senior management. Overall, I believe this program will be important to support our colleagues and create value for our shareholders. In closing, we are well positioned for continued growth. We have the strategies and the momentum in our businesses to support growth. We also benefit from highly engaged colleagues who have consistently delivered outstanding customer service and are a true differentiator.We have a credit discipline to outperform and remain focused on rigorous expense management, investment prioritization and capital allocation. We remain committed to our long track record of managing to positive annual operating leverage and are intently focused on driving shareholder value. Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance.Zach Wasserman: Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides highlights of our fourth quarter results. We reported GAAP earnings per common share of $0.42 and adjusted EPS was $0.43. Return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE, came in at 26% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items, ROTCE was 26.5%. Further adjusting for AOCI ROTCE was 19.8%. Loan balances continued to expand as total loans increased by $1.9 billion and excluding PPP, increased by $2.1 billion. Deposit balances increased by $1.6 billion on an end-of-period basis, while average deposits were essentially flat compared to the prior quarter. Pre-provision net revenue expanded sequentially by 4.2% from last quarter to $893 million. And on a full year basis, year-over-year increased by 36% to $3.2 billion.Credit quality remained strong with net charge-offs of 17 basis points and nonperforming assets declining to 50 basis points. Turning to Slide 7. Average loan balances increased 1.7% quarter-over-quarter driven by both commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans continue to represent the majority of loan growth within commercial, excluding PPP, average loans increased by $1.9 billion or 2.7% from the prior quarter. Primary components of this commercial growth included distribution finance, which increased $900 million tied to continued normalization of dealer inventory levels as well as seasonality with shipments of winter equipment arriving to dealers. We also saw the continued long-term trend of demand within our asset finance businesses, which drove balances $300 million higher in the quarter.Commercial real estate balances increased by $500 million largely as a result of production late in the third quarter and lower prepays. End-of-period balances were higher by $180 million. Auto floor plan utilization continued to normalize which drove balances higher by $300 million. Additional increases in line utilization over time, represents a substantial ongoing opportunity. We also saw higher balances in specialty verticals. Such as mid-corporate and tech and telecom, which were offset by lower balances in other areas as a result of our return optimization initiatives. In Consumer, growth was led by residential mortgage which increased by $500 million as on sheet production outpaced runoff and was supported by slower prepaid speeds. Partially offsetting this growth were lower auto balances, which declined by $230 million and RV Marine, which declined by $50 million.Photo by Marvin Meyer on UnsplashTurning to Slide 8. We delivered $1.6 billion of deposit growth for the quarter and $4.6 billion for the year on an ending basis, on an average basis, deposits were lower by while increasing 2.4% year-over-year. Competition for deposits has intensified, beginning in earnest in September and continuing into the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding that, we are pleased with the traction we saw over the course of the quarter as our teams delivered robust production, demonstrating the deposit gathering capabilities across the bank. Ending deposit growth was led by consumer, which increased by $1.6 billion. We saw a mix shift in line with our expectations, including incremental growth in both money market and time deposits. We continue to remain disciplined on deposit pricing with our total cost of deposits coming in at 64 basis points for the fourth quarter.We will remain dynamic balancing core deposit growth, the competitive rate environment and the utilization of a broad range of funding options. On Slide 9, we reported another quarter of sequential expansion of both net interest income and NIM. Core net interest income, excluding PPP and purchase accounting accretion, increased by $67 million or 5% and to $1.459 billion. Net interest margin expanded 10 basis points on a GAAP basis from the prior quarter and expanded 11 basis points on a core basis, excluding accretion. Slide 10 highlights our high-quality deposit base and diversified funding profile. For the current cycle to date, our beta on total cost of deposits was 17%, as we have noted, we expect deposit rates to continue to trend higher from here over the course of the rate cycle.Overall, our beta continues to track to our expectations. Turning to Slide 11. Throughout 2022, we were deliberate in managing the balance sheet to benefit from asset sensitivity. We also incrementally added to our hedging program to manage possible downside rate risks over the longer term. During the quarter, we executed a net $3.2 billion of received fixed swaps and $800 million of forward-starting swaption collars. At this point, based on the current rate outlook and yield curve opportunities, we believe we have optimized the size of the program. We are comfortable with our position today as we balance near-term costs versus longer-term protection. As always, we will be dynamic as we monitor the outlook and the yield curve. We maintain unused hedge capacity that we could deploy should the curve revert and/or steepen to a level where we would add incremental downside rate protection hedges.On the securities portfolio, we saw another step-up in reported yields quarter-over-quarter. We are benefiting from reinvestment as well as the hedge strategy to protect capital. We will continue to reinvest cash flows of approximately $1 billion each quarter, at attractive new purchase yields around 5%. Moving to Slide 12. Noninterest income was $499 million, up $1 million from last quarter. We drove record activity within our capital markets businesses during the quarter and throughout 2022. Capstone continued to perform well and our underlying capital markets businesses outside of Capstone finished the year strong, up 26% year-over-year. We remain pleased with the client engagement we are seeing in the wealth management business with another positive quarter of net asset flows.On a year-over-year basis, we saw lower mortgage banking income as a result of the higher rate environment and from lower deposit service charges from fair play enhancements we implemented during 2022. Offsetting these factors were higher capital markets revenues and payments revenues. Importantly, we're executing on our strategy to drive higher value revenue streams and our fee mix continues to trend favorably. Moving on to Slide 13. GAAP noninterest expense increased $24 million compared to the prior quarter. Adjusted for notable items, core expenses increased by $19 million. This quarterly increase in core expenses was primarily the result of revenue-driven compensation tied to capital markets production. Additionally, we saw seasonally higher medical claims in the quarter, which increased by $16 million.Underlying these results, core expenses were well controlled, demonstrating our commitment to disciplined expense management. Slide 14 recaps our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 increased to 9.44%. Our tangible common equity ratio, or TCE, increased to 5.55%. Adjusting for AOCI, our TCE ratio was 7.3%. We ended the year having delivered on our plan to drive common equity Tier 1 to the middle of our 9% to 10% operating range. Going forward, our capital priorities have not changed, fund organic growth, support our dividend and provide capacity for all other uses, including share repurchases. After having held back on share repurchases for the last several quarters, our expectation is that over the course of 2023 and beyond, we will now return to a more normalized capital distribution mix, including share repurchases.Our Board has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program through the end of 2024. Given the current economic outlook, our thinking is that we will not actively repurchase shares during the first half of 2023. And as we watch the path of the economy. This may result in capital ratios continuing to expand in the near term. We like the flexibility the program provides, and we believe it is prudent to maintain an authorized share repurchase program as part of our overall capital management framework. On Slide 15, credit quality continues to perform very well. As mentioned, net charge-offs were 17 basis points for the quarter. This was higher than last quarter by 2 basis points and up 5 basis points from the prior year as credit performance continues to normalize.Nonperforming assets declined from the previous quarter and have reduced for 6 consecutive quarters. Criticized loans have similarly improved for 4 consecutive quarters. Allowance for credit losses was up slightly, driving the coverage ratio higher to 1.9% of total loans. Turning to Slide 16. You will note a strong reserve position. As I mentioned, the portfolio has continued to perform extraordinarily well, and we believe our disciplined approach to credit through the cycle underpins the overall strength of our balance sheet. We were pleased to update our medium-term financial targets at Investor Day in November, and these form the foundation of our expectations over our strategic planning horizon. We believe these metrics are at the core of value creation.Profit growth, return on capital and the commitment to drive positive annual operating leverage. Turning to Slide 18. Let me share some thoughts on our 2023 outlook. As we discussed at Investor Day, we analyze multiple potential economic scenarios to project financial performance and develop management action plans. Our targets are anchored on a baseline scenario that is informed by the consensus economic outlook and the forward yield curve as of December 31. The baseline assumes a mild recession in 2023 with modest net GDP growth for the full year. The economy is expected to exit the year on the path toward recovery with inflation gradually subsiding. Since Investor Day, the economic outlook is incrementally worse and is likely at the lower end of the baseline scenario outcomes.See also 16 Stocks with the Lowest PE Ratios and 14 Small Cap Stocks with Huge Potential.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Global crude benchmark Brent went from under $16 to just below $140 in the same period.Al-Saud noted oil’s “relative stability” since those highs, comparing them with the “significant price swings” in “other energy sources” - like natural gas, which lost 50% over the past month. But even as he took a victory lap on that, he said there was more to be done: “We have a very important partnership with Russia on OPEC+ … that has delivered stability [to] the oil market … we are gonna engage with Russia on that.”Ahead of Al-Saud's comments, that same day, some 1,600 miles away in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak was telling state news agency TASS that Moscow “is not discussing with OPEC+ possibility of its oil production cuts”.Novak was responding to a question on whether the Kremlin will reduce oil output to demand a higher price for its Urals crude as the G7’s $60-per-barrel cap allows buyers to lowball the Russian product versus rival crude benchmarks such as the U.K. Brent, U.S. West Texas Intermediate, the Arab Light and Dubai Light.""No, we are not discussing such issues,"" Novak said.Story continuesAt a glance, the Saudi and Russian positions seemed disparate and to be addressing different matters. Al-Saud spoke about engaging Russia to keep oil prices stable while Novak ruled out production cuts by his country. However, anyone who knows the workings of OPEC+ will know how connected the two were; in essence, they were one and the same.""Uncoded, the Saudi message is that they want to sit with the Russians to tell them to stop selling Urals at prices that are so discounted that they are pulling Brent and Arab light down,” said John Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.“The Russians, in response, are basically saying ‘Don’t ask us to restrict our sales to help you.’ The big energy supply squeeze Russia had counted on this winter to pressure the West into paying more for oil and gas has evaporated with the warm weather we’ve had. The Kremlin probably needs whatever money it can get now for its oil. They’re also saying if they cut production now, they might not be able to get it back on.”Russia has historically maintained that oil wells drilled in permafrost could not be shut down easily, as they could freeze, requiring them to be drilled all over again when they are reopened. Oil analysts have called the cold weather claim one of the global oil industry’s biggest geopolitical bluffs. While Moscow did cut 20% of its output by teaming up with the Saudis in 2020, it has lately raised concerns again about the health of oil wells shuttered in the winter.To the Saudis, of course, there is no greater tool to manage supply-demand in oil other than production cuts, although the kingdom’s state oil company Aramco (TADAWUL:2222) routinely tweaks the official selling price of Arab light to obtain desired revenue. With global demand for oil cratering after the global coronavirus outbreak, the Saudis led Russia and the rest of OPEC+ to slash tens of millions of barrels of supply a day. Relatively few hikes have been announced to replace those cuts. The psychological pressure applied by the Saudis on oil consumers has been a major support for crude prices over the past two years.But the G7 price cap - which came into force on Dec. 5 - has been a game changer.With Urals’ selling price limited at $60 a barrel versus Brent’s Friday close of $87.63, a discount of at least $25 on paper applies for each barrel of prompt loading for the Russian crude benchmark.In the actual marketplace, the discounts are bigger, with the chief beneficiaries being India and China - the two biggest buyers of Russian crude.India bought an average of 1.2 million barrels of Urals a day in December, which was 33 times more than a year earlier and 29% more than in November. Discounts for Urals at Russia's western ports for sale to India under some deals widened to $32-$35 per barrel when freight wasn’t included, according to a Reuters report from Dec. 14.The Indians even exported fuel produced from Russian crude to New York via a high-seas transfer at one point, despite U.S. sanctions prohibiting the import of Russian-origin energy products, including refined fuels, distillates, crude oil, coal, and gas.Another Reuters report from Dec. 8 said China was paying the deepest discounts in months for Russian ESPO crude oil amid weak demand and poor refining margins. ESPO is a grade exported from the Russian Far East port of Kozmino and Chinese refiners are dominant clients for this.At least one ESPO cargo for early December arrival was sold to an independent Chinese refiner at a discount of $6 per barrel against the February Brent price on delivery-ex-ship (DES) basis, Reuters said, citing four traders with knowledge of the matter. That discount compared with a premium of about $1.80 fetched by an ESPO barrel in China three weeks prior to the deal. Brent’s plunge to a one-year low of just above $75 by Dec. 9 exacerbated the discount for Russian crude, though the U.K. crude’s rebound to near $88 this week would have narrowed the difference.The United States and its European allies - the chief proponents of the G7 price cap - are, meanwhile, delighted that Russian oil is going so cheaply and abundantly to the market.The West’s original idea was to limit the Kremlin's earnings from oil to slow the Russian military’s advance in Ukraine. That has begun working with the price cap.And while Western countries have banned Russian crude imports, they want to ensure they have enough refined products for their consumers and industries. India and China have stepped up petrol and diesel production with their bumper Urals purchases and some of those are finding their way to Western destinations outside of the U.S. The United States itself appears sufficiently stocked with enough refined products for the winter.Thus, when U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen toured Africa this past week, she took a victory lap on how well the G7 price cap was working. Aside from the West, some 17 of Africa’s net-oil importing countries could save a combined $6 billion annually from the price cap, which allowed them to use the discounted Russian oil as a basis for negotiating the purchase of any crude.So, what can those opposed to the price cap do?The Russians could demand a higher price for the oil they are selling to India and China. The question is how much more. If Brent continues to rally, an upward adjustment for Russian oil prices becomes natural. In the absence of that, Moscow might have to think about playing hardball with the only two countries it can conveniently sell its oil to amid the U.S. sanctions.The Saudis could announce a significant production cut by OPEC+ which the kingdom itself would largely carry, to avoid protests from others in the cartel already upset over the loss of market share. The Saudis announced in November a 2 million barrel per day cut that would take effect in December. Brent hit a three-month high of almost $100 a barrel on that. But Bloomberg later quoted a Saudi official as saying the kingdom shipped 7.21 million barrels a day in December, unchanged from November. “If OPEC+ announces another ‘output cut’, it could be another lie,” said Kilduff of Again Capital. “Most of the alliance members are unable to meet even their production targets. This market trades on headlines and the Saudis know they have enough suckers with the megaphone they wield.”And while China benefits from low Russian prices, it could save the day for OPEC if demand comes roaring back as projected in the world’s top oil importer. But the China rebound story is also contingent on how successful it is in clamping down on new COVID spikes among its billion-plus people. A U.S. and European recession have been forecast at some point this year as well, to offset the Chinese growth.It’s going to be an interesting year ahead in oil.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March delivery did a final trade of $81.96 on Friday after settling the session up $1.03, or 1.4%, at $81.64. For the week, it rose almost 2%.London-traded Brent crude for March delivery settled up $1.47, or 1.7%, at $87.66, after a session peak at $87.75. Brent was up 2.8% for the week.Oil: WTI Price OutlookWith WTI sustaining above the 5-Day Exponential Moving Average of $80.35, signs of further technical advances are emerging for U.S. crude, says Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“However, rebound towards the next major resistance of $93.74 requires a strong and sustained break above the 100-Day Simple Moving Average of $82.10 followed by a clearance through $84.70,” said Dixit.“Meanwhile, a short-term pull back towards the $79 support and a follow-up drop to $75.70 cannot be ruled out,” he added. “This again would very likely attract buyers.”Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The front-month February gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $3.134 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units, on Friday. It officially settled the session at $3.174, down 10.1 cents, or 3%.February gas fell to a 19-month low of $3.11 during the session, sending gas bulls up gasping for air on fears of the market tumbling to $2 levels. Fortunately, for the longs, the moment passed, with the $3 support holding.Natural gas: Price OutlookNatural gas could actually go on to break the much-watched $3 support in the coming week, though its drop below that could also be brief, said Dixit.“The current bearish drop could pause at $2.989 and a short-term rebound towards the resistance zone of $4.75 could start. The rebound will have several twists and turns en route to the $4.75 destination.”Dixit, however, said the upward projection was based on natural gas staying with its Fibonacci extension. “Natural gas is more of a weather-driven commodity now, where fundamentals rule, rather than technicals.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold for February delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,927.70 an ounce on Friday after settling the official session at $1,928.20, up $4.30, or 0.2%. It earlier hit a nine-month high at $1,938.85.Investing.com data shows that if February gold were to get past $1,950, its next major target would be the April 18 target of $2,003.Aside from its advance on Friday, the benchmark U.S. gold futures contract rose 0.3% for the week, adding to its 6.7% gain over four prior weeks.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled down $6.02, or 0.3%, at $1,926.22 on the day. Spot gold peaked at $1,937.54 on Friday - its highest since the $1,955.93 attained on April 25. Spot gold’s bigger target would be the March 10 target of $2,009.57.Gold: Price Outlook For a second week in a row, gold has closed above the $1,896 level, which marks a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the $2,070 high and the $1,614 low, said Dixit.“Prices are getting consistent support from the 5 Week Exponential Moving Average, which signals bullish continuation,” he said.“Going forth, a sustained move above $1,920 indicates presence of strong momentum and a sustained break above the recent high of $1,937.72 will be needed for an advance towards the next major resistance and target of $1,972.76, which marks the 78.6% Fibonacci level.”Dixit, however, said a drop below $1,920 would indicate a consolidation towards the $1915-$1905-$1896 support areas.“A sustained break below $1,896 will put the brakes on the current bullish momentum and a short correction towards $1,880 may then be witnessed.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesTexas regulator proposes power market overhaul after 2021 freezeYellen says Russian oil price cap could save African countries $6 billion annually]"

It earlier hit a nine-month high at $1,938.85.Investing.com data shows that if February gold were to get past $1,950, its next major target would be the April 18 target of $2,003.Aside from its advance on Friday, the benchmark U.S. gold futures contract rose 0.3% for the week, adding to its 6.7% gain over four prior weeks.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled down $6.02, or 0.3%, at $1,926.22 on the day. Spot gold peaked at $1,937.54 on Friday - its highest since the $1,955.93 attained on April 25. Spot gold’s bigger target would be the March 10 target of $2,009.57.Gold: Price Outlook For a second week in a row, gold has closed above the $1,896 level, which marks a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the $2,070 high and the $1,614 low, said Dixit.“Prices are getting consistent support from the 5 Week Exponential Moving Average, which signals bullish continuation,” he said.“Going forth, a sustained move above $1,920 indicates presence of strong momentum and a sustained break above the recent high of $1,937.72 will be needed for an advance towards the next major resistance and target of $1,972.76, which marks the 78.6% Fibonacci level.”Dixit, however, said a drop below $1,920 would indicate a consolidation towards the $1915-$1905-$1896 support areas.“A sustained break below $1,896 will put the brakes on the current bullish momentum and a short correction towards $1,880 may then be witnessed.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesTexas regulator proposes power market overhaul after 2021 freezeYellen says Russian oil price cap could save African countries $6 billion annually]"

19,aca35a01-976d-3463-a2ba-3a5a1aa02bd2,MSFT,2023-01-22,12 Biggest Cloud Providers by Market Share in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-biggest-cloud-providers-market-154233019.html,1674315753,STORY,"['MSFT', 'TCEHY', 'DELL', 'BIDU']","[In this article, we take a look at 12 biggest cloud providers by market share in the world. If you want to see more biggest cloud providers by market share in the world, go directly to 5 Biggest Cloud Providers by Market Share in the World.Cloud computing is a growing sector.In cloud computing, there are two sectors, both of which are growing, cloud infrastructure as a service or IaaS, and software as a service or SaaS.In terms of cloud infrastructure as a service, there aren't that many big infrastructure as a service cloud providers in the world given the substantial upfront capital needed to be competitive in the field. Considering the cloud infrastructure as a service is very competitive with many of the biggest players constantly cutting their fees for a unit of processing, only the biggest players are profitable. As the leader, Amazon Web Services accounts for a substantial percentage of Amazon's total profits. Meanwhile, big cloud providers such as Google Cloud are still losing money in an effort to grow their market share.In terms of the cloud software as a service market, the market is arguably less competitive as it is more segmented. Given many customers subscribe to software as a service providers, there is also recurring revenue potential.Third Quarter 2022 Cloud Infrastructure Services Industry GrowthWhile it is very competitive, the cloud infrastructure services market is huge.According to the Synergy Research Group, total enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services in the third quarter of 2022 rose more than $11 billion from Q3 2021 to over than $57 billion. During the quarter, the cloud market at the top was very concentrated as the top three players of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have around two thirds market share globally of the cloud infrastructure services market.Chief analyst at Synergy Research Group John Dinsdale said of the Q3 industry results, “It is a strong testament to the benefits of cloud computing that despite two major obstacles to growth the worldwide market still expanded by 24% from last year. Had exchange rates remained stable and had the Chinese market remained on a more normal path then the growth rate percentage would have been well into the thirties. The three leading cloud providers all report their financials in US dollars so their growth rates are all beaten down by the historic strength of their home currency.""Story continuesIn terms of their individual growth rates, Amazon Web Services expanded by 27.5% year over year, Microsoft's Azure expanded 35% year over year and Google Cloud Platform grew 38% year over year.Given the growth in the third quarter, the trailing twelve month revenues of the cloud infrastructure services market reached $217 billion according to Synergy Research Group estimates.Given rising interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty with a potential recession, some enterprises have become more cautious in their spending and the overall industry spend for the period was less than some estimates.The Future GrowthGiven the tailwinds in the industry in the long term, analysts expect the cloud infrastructure as a service market to grow substantially in the future. According to Research and Market, the global cloud computing market could grow by an average CAGR of 15.7% from 2022 to 2030 to surpass over $1.55 trillion by 2030 as more firms shift to cloud computing for cost savings and flexibility.One reason for substantially more expected growth is AI processing. As AI applications like ChatGPT gain more popularity, demand for cloud computing could grow further. Considering the amount of cloud computing power needed to make an application as sophisticated as ChatGPT, big tech cloud providers are among the few companies currently that can offer the processing needed to make an application like ChatGPT.In 2019, Microsoft invested $1 billion into OpenAI in the form of cash and credits for Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform. Given ChatGPT has experienced substantial demand since its launch, the company is reportedly looking to raise more capital at around a $30 billion valuation. Once it raises more capital, a substantial amount will likely be spent on cloud processing to make ChatGPT even better, which could bring more business for Microsoft.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Biggest Cloud Providers by Market Share in the World, we list only the market shares of the cloud infrastructure as a service market and not the software as a service market because they are two different markets.We ranked the cloud providers based on their market shares in the cloud infrastructure service market which includes platform as a service, infrastructure as a service and hosted private cloud services according to Synergy Research Group in Q3 2022.Because their infrastructure as a service market share is under 2%, we just ranked Dell Cloud, VMware Cloud, Huawei Cloud, and Baidu Cloud as &lt;2% in market share.For those of you interested, also check out 15 Most Innovative Companies in the World.12 Biggest Cloud Providers by Market Share in the World12. Baidu AI CloudWorldwide Market Share in Q3 2022: &lt;2%Baidu AI Cloud is the cloud compute service of Chinese internet search company Baidu. According to the company it provides compute &amp; storage, network &amp; CDN, database, big data, and security services. In 2021, Baidu AI Cloud had around 9% market share in the China Cloud infrastructure services spend market, ranking fourth after Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, and Tencent Cloud. Because China's cloud market size is substantial, Baidu AI Cloud is one of the larger IaaS cloud companies globally.11. VMwareWorldwide Market Share in Q3 2022: &lt;2%VMware's cloud infrastructure services is one of the products of VMware, which is a leading provider of multi-cloud services that enables digital innovation with enterprise control. Originally a part of Dell Technologies after the latter's acquisition of EMC Corp in 2015, VMware spun off from Dell Technologies in November of 2021 so that the company could have more strategic flexibility to potentially grow faster by gaining more freedom to invest in cloud computing.10. Dell TechnologiesWorldwide Market Share in Q3 2022: &lt;2%In addition to making PCs, Dell Technologies also provides infrastructure as a service with its Dell Technologies Cloud. According to the company, ""The Dell Technologies Cloud IaaS model has been invaluable for enterprises. By provisioning and making fully managed servers, storage, networking and other compute resources accessible via the Internet, IaaS offerings allow businesses to avoid the cost and complexity of purchasing and managing their own infrastructure.""9. Huawei CloudWorldwide Market Share in Q3 2022: &lt;2%Huawei Cloud is the cloud infrastructure computing service provided by Chinese technology company Huawei. Given its market share in China, Huawei Cloud could potentially rank higher on this list but we included it at #9 because Synergy Research Group didn't rank it among the top eight cloud infrastructure service providers globally in Q3 2022. According to China Internet Watch, Huawei Cloud had 18% market share in the China cloud infrastructure service spend in 2021, more than Tencent Cloud's 16%, and Baidu AI Cloud's 9%. Given the company is private, however, it is difficult to determine how much market share it has currently but it certainly ranks among the leaders.8. Oracle CloudWorldwide Market Share in Q3 2022: 2%Oracle Cloud is database and enterprise software maker's Oracle Corporation's IaaS offering where it has around a 2% global market share. In Q2 fiscal 2023, Oracle Corporation's IaaS sales rose 53% year over year to $1 billion, which is actually a little bit faster than the overall industry's growth. One reason for the fast growth could be that TikTok routed 100% of the app's US user traffic to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as of June 2022. TikTok previously used its own data centers for US traffic.7. Tencent CloudWorldwide Market Share in Q3 2022: 2%Tencent Cloud is a cloud computing service provided by Chinese social media giant Tencent. According to the company, Tencent cloud has numerous software developers from many different industries using it including Tencent's own WeChat messaging application. In terms of market share, Tencent Cloud had a 16% market share in the China cloud infrastructure services industry in 2021 and an around 2% market share the cloud infrastructure service market worldwide in Q3 2022.6. SalesforceWorldwide Market Share in Q3 2022: 3%In addition to being a leading SaaS provider, Salesforce Inc offers a platform as a service solution that ""allows businesses to easily deploy, run, and manage custom cloud applications without the complexity of building and maintaining their own servers and infrastructure."" With its Salesforce Platform and other services, Salesforce has a worldwide market share of 3% in the cloud infrastructure service market in Q3 2022.Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Cloud Providers by Market Share in the World.Suggested articles:15 Most Innovative Countries in the World15 Most Valuable Silicon Valley Companies in the World25 Highest Paid Athletes of All TimeDisclosure: None. 12 Biggest Cloud Providers by Market Share in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

JPMorgan wrote, ""...the meaningful depreciation of cryptocurrency prices will make it much harder for Coinbase to return to profitability.""Crypto-anything is popular around the world, and even a simple PT increase, with JPMorgan staying sidelined, sent the equity flying in the premarket session. The strength continued throughout the day and Coinbase closed Friday up nearly $6, or 11.61%, at $55.16.Positive estimate revisions seen at ValeroEarlier in the week, BMO Capital upgraded Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) to Outperform with a $160 PT.The bank noted, ""We see positive consensus estimate revisions and are 18% above on 2023 EPS.

Our previous near-term caution on PM had been based on an assumption of an unfavorable European Tobacco Tax Directive (EU TTD) for RRP taxes, and then PM's lack of current RRP exposure to US, and potential share and cost implications around this.""PM shares jumped on Thursday, making up lost ground from the previous session, and closed nearly even for the week.***If you’re interested in upgrading your search for new investing ideas, check out InvestingProRelated ArticlesPayPal stock forecast darkens: The week's 4 biggest analyst movesSaudi Arabia stocks higher at close of trade; Tadawul All Share up 0.40%Bayer investor criticizes Bayer chair for lack of initiative - WirtschaftsWoche]"

Our fourth quarter sales of $4.2 billion were near the record levels achieved in 2021 despite significant unfavorable foreign currency translation. Sales were aided by our strong U.S. automotive refinish volume growth as supply chain disruptions started to moderate, and our order books remain robust. In 2022, our automotive refinish coatings business delivered over 2,000 net new body shop wins as customers continue to value the product technology and industry-leading services and capabilities that this business delivers every day, including what we believe is the best-in-class body shop for repair product.Also aiding our sales were record results in our PPG Comex business in Mexico as our team continued their strong execution and delivered another record quarter of sales and earnings. PPG Comex sales are now more than $1 billion on annual sales basis, another record year for this business. Our aerospace business continued to recover, delivering organic sales growth of more than 20% on a year-over-year basis, even with continued supply chain challenges. With an initial reopening in China, strong global order book, increased military related growth and PPG's advantaged technology products we expect this business to continue to grow in 2023 and beyond. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.22, above the midpoint of $1.13 from the guidance we provided in October.Photo by JOSHUA COLEMAN on UnsplashThis included more than 20% year-over-year segment earnings improvement driven by selling price realization and strong cost management. On a two-year stack, selling prices were up about 19%. We achieved this segment earnings improvement despite the significant and unpredictable shutdowns in China from COVID-19 that were worse than what we had anticipated going into the quarter and these have continued into the first quarter. In Europe, despite demand remaining soft, earnings were similar to prior year due to strong selling price realization and cost management. We also continue to execute our previously announced restructuring programs and realization of acquisition synergies and delivered about $20 million of savings in the quarter. Now a few comments on the full year 2022.The challenges were many, including unprecedented cost inflation, unexpected geopolitical issues in Europe, disruptive and unpredictable shutdowns in China, strong appreciation of the U.S. dollar and rapid escalation in interest rates in the United States. Though all of these factors impacted our sales and margin performance, the PPG team responded to these challenges, including rapidly implementing real-time selling price increases that, by early 2023, will offset all cumulative cost inflation incurred since early 2021. Given the more difficult macro backdrop, we also announced, and are quickly executing new cost savings initiatives with particular focus on Europe. In 2022, we also made good progress on key strategic initiatives, including strengthening our relationship with the Home Depot, as evidenced by the launch of our new U.S. architectural Pro program, and winning more shelf space with our Glidden Max-Flex spray paint.In addition, we were honored to be awarded Home Depot's 2022 Overall Innovation Award, which was the first time that a paint supplier has achieved this distinction. Our partnership with the Home Depot continues to be a great opportunity for significant growth in the coming years. The PPG team continued the integration of our recent acquisitions, including timely execution of acquisition-related synergies. These businesses are all executing well and will provide the Company with increased organic growth prospects in the next few years. We made some smaller, but strategically important powder coating acquisitions, which aid needed manufacturing capacity and greatly aids our technological capabilities in this fast-growing product category. In 2022, we once again lowered our SG&amp;A as a percent of sales, decreasing by about 100 basis points, including the delivery of about $65 million in restructuring savings in the year.While working capital remains higher than we would like, we made solid progress in the second half 2022 to lower our inventories on a sequential basis. We expect cash conversion to return to our historical levels in 2023 and have exited 2022 with a strong and flexible balance sheet. Throughout 2022, we took actions to bolster our ESG program, including announcing our commitment to the science-based targets initiative, issuing our first-ever diversity report, and finally obtaining shareholder approval to declassify our board and remove supermajority voting requirements. In 2023, I expect our team to continue their strong progress by introducing additional sustainable products for our customers and unveiling our new 2030 sustainability goals.In summary, for 2022, we did not meet our own earnings expectations. But through the resiliency of the global PPG team, we did deliver record sales of $17.7 billion and set the foundation for many accretive growth initiatives. Now moving to our outlook. As we outlined in our press release, we expect the Q1 demand environment to remain similar to the fourth quarter. However, as the year progresses, we are more confident that we have several catalysts that will enable PPG to drive earnings growth, including improvements in the supply chain, which will further moderate raw material costs, and we expect to see this flow through our P&amp;L more prominently starting in the second quarter. Also, our strong position in China that will benefit us as the COVID reopening progresses.With respect to Europe, we expect coatings demand stabilization beginning in the second quarter, resulting in higher year-over-year earnings. In the U.S., we will benefit from the continued recovery of the aerospace and automotive refinish businesses and the current strength of our order books in both of those businesses. Also in the U.S., our recent share gains in the architectural business will help buffer lower demand from a softer U.S. housing market. As a reminder, our overall exposure to the U.S. new home construction market is relatively small, only about 1% of our global revenues. As we said last quarter, we believe our global portfolio mix will prove more resilience in the coming quarters if we experience a broader global economic decline.As normal course of business, we will be highly focused on controlling the controllables, including managing our costs and optimizing working capital. In summary, while economic conditions are challenging in the near term, I expect segment margin recovery to continue in the first quarter and remain confident about the future earnings capabilities of PPG, and we certainly see a path to return to prior peak operating margins with opportunities to exceed it. As I begin my tenure as CEO, and the PPG team is laser focused on delivering improved financial results, including recovering our historical margin profile, and executing on all levers to return our portfolio to mid- to high-teen percentage segment markets. At a high level, you can expect me and the PPG team to elevate our collaboration with our customers, bringing them innovative, sustainable and differentiated products and solutions, which will enable our customers to improve their productivity and growth and allow us to improve our own organic growth performance.We'll simplify and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies to reduce complexity and deliver productivity for both PPG and our customers. And we will preserve our legacy of prudent management of our balance sheet, continuing to prioritize cash deployment for shareholder value creation. I plan to share more details on our key initiatives as the year progresses. In closing, I am looking forward to leading this great team, 50,000 employees around the world, as we continue to partner with our customers to create mutual value. This year marks PPG's 140th year anniversary, and I strongly believe that our best days are ahead thanks to our people, industry-leading products, innovative technologies and great customers. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG.This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, Emily, would you please open the line for questions.See also 11 Best Dividend Stocks for Rising Interest Rates and 11 Best Debt Free Stocks To Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

And welcome to the SLB Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead.ND Maduemezia: Thank you, Leah. Good morning. And welcome to the SLB fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston, following our Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our fourth quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to you, Olivier.Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, ND. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will cover our fourth quarter results and follow this with a quick review of our full year 2022 achievements. Then I will share some thoughts on the outlook for the full year. Stephane will then provide more detail on our financial results and we will open for your questions. To begin, we sustained growth momentum through the fourth quarter, delivering strong revenue growth and further margin expansion, both sequentially and year-over-year. The quarter was characterized by very strong activity growth in the Middle East and offshore and was augmented by robust year-end sales in Digital. Growth was once again broad-based and our operational, commercial and earnings performance was outstanding.Story continuesWe ended the fourth quarter with sequential revenue growth and margin expansion in North America and in all international areas. In the international markets, quarterly revenue topped $6 million for the first time in more than four years. Additionally, our international revenue growth rate has visibly outpaced the international rig count growth since the cycle trough in 2020. Service pricing, new technology and digital adoption all continued to trend positively. Looking broadly over the second half of the year, the pace of growth in North America significantly moderated. At the same time, international accelerated, growing in excess of 20% compared to the first half of the year, almost twice the growth rate of North America. We are clearly witnessing the start of a new phase of -- in the growth cycle, which will increasingly be driven by resilient international growth.This market dynamic led to a lower-than-usual cash flow performance at year-end. However, we further reduced net debt during the quarter and closed the year below our leverage target. Overall, these fourth quarter results helped us surpass our revised full year revenue guidance and we closed with EPS, pre-tax segment operating income and margins all at the highest levels in seven years. Switching to the full year, 2022 was pivotal for our industry and for SLB. It marked the second consecutive year of outperformance for the energy sector, providing further evidence of the multiyear upcycle and investment momentum that is underway. I would like to take a few minutes to reflect on what we achieved. We announced our new brand identity, with sustainability embedded in everything we do and opened a new chapter for the company.This firmly positions SLB to benefit from the underlying macro trends that will shape the future of the energy, Oil &amp; Gas Technology Innovation, Industrial Decarbonization, Digital Transformation and New Energy Systems. We executed consistently for our customers, achieving our best safety and operational integrated performance on record. We advanced our technology leadership and service quality differentiation, leading to more contract awards, higher technology adoption and increased pricing premiums. In our Core Divisions, we expanded pre-tax operating margins by more than 300 basis points. This was led by well construction, which expanded margins by more than 550 basis points. We also launched new products, services and solutions that increase efficiency and lower operational emissions.You have seen many examples of these in today's press release. Our Fit-for-Basin, Technology Access and Transition Technologies Portfolio have fueled growth and margin expansion in every division and every geographic area throughout the year. And we continue to strengthen our Core portfolio for growth and position for future resilience and returns with the acquisition of Gyrodata and the announced joint venture with Aker Solutions for subsea. In Digital, we had strong growth in Exploration Data, INNOVATION Factori and AI solution sales, and the adoption of our new tech digital platform is accelerating. We ended the year with more than 270 DELFI customers, more than 70% growth in DELFI users and our SaaS revenue more than doubled. These positive undercurrents combined with higher APS revenue, contributed to the Digital &amp; Integration Divisions, expanding pre-tax operating margins by more than 170 basis points.We continue to build adjacent expansion opportunities for our Digital business, both in operations data space and beyond oil and gas, such as carbon management. And in New Energy, we progressed technology development milestones, established new partnerships, particularly in CCS, and made new investments that have created a focused, yet comprehensive portfolio that offers promising growth opportunities for the future. Today, this portfolio comprises five business areas, Carbon Solutions, Hydrogen, Geothermal and Geoenergy, Critical Minerals and Stationary Energy Storage, and we are accelerating our R&amp;D efforts to develop technology solutions that address hard to abate industrial and power generation emissions. As you see, our three engines of growth are on solid footing and are positioned for market success.Photo by WORKSITE Ltd. on UnsplashIn sustainability, we reduced our own carbon emissions intensity in Scopes 1 and 2, and we continue to be one of the highest ranked companies in our industry across the four rating agencies. We also made significant advances launching SLB End-to-End Emission Solution or SEES, an industry first to help our oil and gas customers address methane and other greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, for our shareholders, we demonstrated our commitment to superior returns. We increased our dividend by 40% in April 2022, followed by a further 43% increase announced today and resumed our share buyback program this month. These achievements highlight a remarkable year for SLB and speak to how we have successfully leveraged the breadth of our portfolio and our competitive strengths to deliver peer-leading outcomes for our customers and shareholders.We are primed for significant success and look forward to carrying momentum into the year ahead. I would like to extend my thanks to the entire SLB team for delivering an outstanding year. Moving to the macro, we enter 2023 against the backdrop of market fundamentals that remain compelling for both oil and gas and low carbon energy resource. First, despite concerns for potential economic slowdown in certain regions, oil and gas demand growth remains resilient. The IEA forecasts that oil and gas demand will grow by 1.9 million barrels to reach approximately 102 million barrels per day. In parallel, markets will remain tightly supplied with modest production increases offset by the end of SPR release and well productivity declines in certain regions, most notably in North America.Second, there is a greater sense of urgency around energy security. This is resulting in new investment in capacity expansion and diversity of supply. You will see this reflected in the number of new projects sanctioned, gas supply agreements signed and the return of offshore exploration, all at a pace unforeseen just 18 months ago. And third, the secular trends of digital and decarbonization are set to accelerate, driven by significant digital technology advancement in cloud and AI, favorable government policy support in New Energy investments and increased spending on low carbon initiatives by operator globally. Underpinning everything, commodity price remained at supportive levels for durable investment. In North America, spending growth is expected to be more restrained after an exceptionally strong year in 2022.Capital spending growth is expected to increase in the high teens as rig counts potentially approach a plateau. Public companies, particularly the majors, are expected to increase short-cycle spending in key U.S. land basins and drilling activity remain strong to build up well inventory and support target production increase. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where we have a significant presence, we expect the strong spending uplift to continue. Turning to international, markets are poised for strong growth in the Middle East and Latin America geographically, and more broadly, in offshore and in gas. In the Middle East, we expect record levels of upstream investments, with a ramp-up in various capacity expansion projects designed to deliver more gas production and a combined oil increment of 4 million barrels per day through 2030.Offshore activity will continue to strengthen as tiebacks and new development projects mobilize and new FID's are sanctioned, while Russian activity is expected to contract. Excluding Russia, customers' capital spending internationally is expected to increase in the mid-teens. The combination of long-cycle oil capacity expansion projects, offshore deepwater resurgence and strong gas development activity will be a key driver for the multiyear duration of this cycle. This outlook is very favorable for SLB with multiple paths of resilient growth in Core, Digital and New Energy. On a full year basis, our ambition is to grow revenue in excess of 15% compared to 2022, supported by the step-up in international and offshore momentum, which will augment growth established in North America.As a result, year-on-year adjusted EBITDA growth will be in the mid-20s driven by further margin expansion. More specifically, in the international markets, we foresee growth in the high-teens, excluding Russia, which is set to decline this year. We expect the highest growth rates to be realized in the Middle East and in offshore markets, particularly in Latin America and in Africa. In North America, we anticipate about 20% growth supported by offshore strength, land drilling activity and higher pricing. Full year margin expansion will be driven by further positive pricing dynamics, increased technology adoption and improvements from our enhanced operating leverage, mainly internationally. Let me share with you how we see this year unfolding.Directionally, during the first quarter, we anticipate a typical pattern of activity begin -- beginning with the combined effect of seasonality and the absence of year-end product and digital sales. Additionally, the first quarter will reflect some impact of year-on-year Russia activity decline. This will be followed by a rebound in the second quarter and further acceleration of growth trajectory in the second half of the year, particularly in the international markets. This typical pattern of activity and the favorable dynamics I described earlier combine to support the ambition we have set for full year growth and margin expansion. In addition, the beneficial impacts of an earlier than expected reopening in China, the easing of inflationary trends and any further restriction on Russian exports could lead to an acceleration of short-cycle activity globally and fast-tracking of FIDs internationally.This could present further upside over the second half of the year. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.See also 18 Countries that Produce the Most Nuclear Energy and 11 Best American Oil Stocks To Buy.Stephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits was $0.71. This represents an increase of $0.08 compared to the third quarter and an increase of $0.30 or 73% when compared to the same period of last year. In addition, we recorded a net credit of $0.03, which brought our GAAP EPS to $0.74. You can find details of the components of this net credit in the FAQs at the end of our earnings press release. Overall, our fourth quarter revenue of $7.9 billion increased 5% sequentially and 27% year-on-year. All divisions posted sequential revenue growth led by Digital &amp; Integration and Reservoir Performance. From a geographical perspective, North America revenue grew 6% sequentially, while international revenue grew 5%, led by the Middle East.Fourth quarter pre-tax operating margins of 19.8% improved 104 basis points sequentially and 393 basis points year-on-year. Notably, over 70% of our GeoUnits posted their best margins since 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter of 24.4% was 219 basis points higher than the same quarter of last year, exceeding the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Let me now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth quarter Digital &amp; Integration revenue of $1 billion increased 12% sequentially, with pre-tax operating margins expanding 386 basis points to 37.7%. This growth was driven by year-end exploration data licensing sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Africa. Increased APS project activity in Ecuador and higher digital sales internationally.Reservoir Performance revenue increased 7% sequentially, while margins expanded 146 basis points, primarily due to new projects and activity gains internationally, led by the Middle East and the offshore basins. Well Construction revenue of $3.2 billion, increased 5% sequentially, due to strong activity from new projects and solid pricing improvements internationally, particularly in the Middle East and in Latin America. Margins of 21% declined 50 basis points, as improved profitability from the higher activity in the Middle East and Latin America was more than offset by the onset of seasonal effects in the Northern Hemisphere. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.2 billion was up 3% sequentially on higher international sales of artificial lift, completions and midstream production systems, partially offset by reduced sales of valves and subsea production systems.Margins improved 32 basis points due to favorable technology and project mix. Now turning to our liquidity. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $855 million. This performance did not reflect the increase we typically experience in the last quarter of the year as free cash flow was $200 million lower than in the previous quarter. This was due to a combination of the following four factors. First, we experienced extraordinary year-on-year fourth quarter revenue growth of 27%, representing incremental revenue of almost $1.7 billion. Second, our inventory balance increased 22% year-on-year to support our increasing product backlog driven by the sizable share of tender awards we have secured going into 2023.Third, we pulled forward certain investments in CapEx in order to fully seize the continued revenue growth expected in 2023, particularly in our Well Construction and Reservoir Performance divisions. As a result, our capital investments increased $255 million sequentially. Our full year 2022 capital investments were therefore $2.3 billion, as compared to our initial guidance at the beginning of the year of $1.9 billion to $2 billion. Despite this increase, the CapEx portion of our capital investments was still at the midpoint of our 5% to 7% of revenue target. Lastly, lower-than-expected year-end accounts receivable collections contributed to reduced free cash flow. As you may recall, we had exceptional cash collections in the fourth quarter of 2021.We did not achieve the same level of year-end collections as last year, and as a result, our DSO in Q4 2022 was approximately five days higher than at the same time last year. However, it is worth noting that our 2022 year-end DSO was the second best we have achieved going back at least two decades. Therefore, this is just a timing issue. Beyond free cash flow, our overall cash position was enhanced by the partial monetization of our investment in the Arabian Drilling Company, an onshore and offshore drilling rig company in Saudi Arabia. ADC completed an initial public offering during the fourth quarter and in connection with this IPO, we sold a portion of our interest in the secondary offering that resulted in us receiving net proceeds of $223 million.We currently have a 34% interest in ADC. We also sold an additional portion of our shares in Liberty, which generated $218 million of net proceeds during the quarter. We currently have a 5% interest in Liberty. As a result of all of this, we ended the year with net debt of $9.3 billion. This represents an improvement of approximately $400 million sequentially and $1.7 billion compared to the end of 2021. This also represents our lowest net debt level since the first quarter of 2016. Consequently, our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is now down to 1.4. In addition, our gross debt reduced by almost $2 billion during the year. We repaid in the fourth quarter $900 million of debt that matured and repurchased $800 million of notes that were going to come due in 2024 and 2025.As a result of our strong operating results and the net debt reduction, our return on capital employed for 2022 was 13%, representing its highest level since 2014. Now looking ahead to 2023. We expect total capital investments consisting of CapEx and investments in APS and exploration data to be approximately $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, as compared to $2.3 billion in 2022. Based on this, our capital investments will grow at a slower pace than our expected revenue growth in 2023. As a result and when taking into account our 2023 guidance for EBITDA to increase in the mid-20s when compared to 2022, we are confident that our free cash flow will increase significantly in 2023. Accordingly, we reaffirm our ambition to deliver a minimum average of 10% free cash flow margin through the 2021 to 2025 period.This will allow us to continue increasing returns to shareholders as we leverage both the length and strength of the current growth cycle. Specifically, for 2023, we expect to distribute visibly more than 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders between dividends and stock buybacks. Today, we declared the 44 -- the 43% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.25 per share, in line with our announcement at our recent Investor Day event. In addition, we have resumed our share repurchase program this month and are targeting a minimum amount of $200 million for the quarter. For 2023, we are targeting to return a total of $2 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane.

Global crude benchmark Brent went from under $16 to just below $140 in the same period.Al-Saud noted oil’s “relative stability” since those highs, comparing them with the “significant price swings” in “other energy sources” - like natural gas, which lost 50% over the past month. But even as he took a victory lap on that, he said there was more to be done: “We have a very important partnership with Russia on OPEC+ … that has delivered stability [to] the oil market … we are gonna engage with Russia on that.”Ahead of Al-Saud's comments, that same day, some 1,600 miles away in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak was telling state news agency TASS that Moscow “is not discussing with OPEC+ possibility of its oil production cuts”.Novak was responding to a question on whether the Kremlin will reduce oil output to demand a higher price for its Urals crude as the G7’s $60-per-barrel cap allows buyers to lowball the Russian product versus rival crude benchmarks such as the U.K. Brent, U.S. West Texas Intermediate, the Arab Light and Dubai Light.""No, we are not discussing such issues,"" Novak said.Story continuesAt a glance, the Saudi and Russian positions seemed disparate and to be addressing different matters. Al-Saud spoke about engaging Russia to keep oil prices stable while Novak ruled out production cuts by his country. However, anyone who knows the workings of OPEC+ will know how connected the two were; in essence, they were one and the same.""Uncoded, the Saudi message is that they want to sit with the Russians to tell them to stop selling Urals at prices that are so discounted that they are pulling Brent and Arab light down,” said John Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.“The Russians, in response, are basically saying ‘Don’t ask us to restrict our sales to help you.’ The big energy supply squeeze Russia had counted on this winter to pressure the West into paying more for oil and gas has evaporated with the warm weather we’ve had. The Kremlin probably needs whatever money it can get now for its oil. They’re also saying if they cut production now, they might not be able to get it back on.”Russia has historically maintained that oil wells drilled in permafrost could not be shut down easily, as they could freeze, requiring them to be drilled all over again when they are reopened. Oil analysts have called the cold weather claim one of the global oil industry’s biggest geopolitical bluffs. While Moscow did cut 20% of its output by teaming up with the Saudis in 2020, it has lately raised concerns again about the health of oil wells shuttered in the winter.To the Saudis, of course, there is no greater tool to manage supply-demand in oil other than production cuts, although the kingdom’s state oil company Aramco (TADAWUL:2222) routinely tweaks the official selling price of Arab light to obtain desired revenue. With global demand for oil cratering after the global coronavirus outbreak, the Saudis led Russia and the rest of OPEC+ to slash tens of millions of barrels of supply a day. Relatively few hikes have been announced to replace those cuts. The psychological pressure applied by the Saudis on oil consumers has been a major support for crude prices over the past two years.But the G7 price cap - which came into force on Dec. 5 - has been a game changer.With Urals’ selling price limited at $60 a barrel versus Brent’s Friday close of $87.63, a discount of at least $25 on paper applies for each barrel of prompt loading for the Russian crude benchmark.In the actual marketplace, the discounts are bigger, with the chief beneficiaries being India and China - the two biggest buyers of Russian crude.India bought an average of 1.2 million barrels of Urals a day in December, which was 33 times more than a year earlier and 29% more than in November. Discounts for Urals at Russia's western ports for sale to India under some deals widened to $32-$35 per barrel when freight wasn’t included, according to a Reuters report from Dec. 14.The Indians even exported fuel produced from Russian crude to New York via a high-seas transfer at one point, despite U.S. sanctions prohibiting the import of Russian-origin energy products, including refined fuels, distillates, crude oil, coal, and gas.Another Reuters report from Dec. 8 said China was paying the deepest discounts in months for Russian ESPO crude oil amid weak demand and poor refining margins. ESPO is a grade exported from the Russian Far East port of Kozmino and Chinese refiners are dominant clients for this.At least one ESPO cargo for early December arrival was sold to an independent Chinese refiner at a discount of $6 per barrel against the February Brent price on delivery-ex-ship (DES) basis, Reuters said, citing four traders with knowledge of the matter. That discount compared with a premium of about $1.80 fetched by an ESPO barrel in China three weeks prior to the deal. Brent’s plunge to a one-year low of just above $75 by Dec. 9 exacerbated the discount for Russian crude, though the U.K. crude’s rebound to near $88 this week would have narrowed the difference.The United States and its European allies - the chief proponents of the G7 price cap - are, meanwhile, delighted that Russian oil is going so cheaply and abundantly to the market.The West’s original idea was to limit the Kremlin's earnings from oil to slow the Russian military’s advance in Ukraine. That has begun working with the price cap.And while Western countries have banned Russian crude imports, they want to ensure they have enough refined products for their consumers and industries. India and China have stepped up petrol and diesel production with their bumper Urals purchases and some of those are finding their way to Western destinations outside of the U.S. The United States itself appears sufficiently stocked with enough refined products for the winter.Thus, when U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen toured Africa this past week, she took a victory lap on how well the G7 price cap was working. Aside from the West, some 17 of Africa’s net-oil importing countries could save a combined $6 billion annually from the price cap, which allowed them to use the discounted Russian oil as a basis for negotiating the purchase of any crude.So, what can those opposed to the price cap do?The Russians could demand a higher price for the oil they are selling to India and China. The question is how much more. If Brent continues to rally, an upward adjustment for Russian oil prices becomes natural. In the absence of that, Moscow might have to think about playing hardball with the only two countries it can conveniently sell its oil to amid the U.S. sanctions.The Saudis could announce a significant production cut by OPEC+ which the kingdom itself would largely carry, to avoid protests from others in the cartel already upset over the loss of market share. The Saudis announced in November a 2 million barrel per day cut that would take effect in December. Brent hit a three-month high of almost $100 a barrel on that. But Bloomberg later quoted a Saudi official as saying the kingdom shipped 7.21 million barrels a day in December, unchanged from November. “If OPEC+ announces another ‘output cut’, it could be another lie,” said Kilduff of Again Capital. “Most of the alliance members are unable to meet even their production targets. This market trades on headlines and the Saudis know they have enough suckers with the megaphone they wield.”And while China benefits from low Russian prices, it could save the day for OPEC if demand comes roaring back as projected in the world’s top oil importer. But the China rebound story is also contingent on how successful it is in clamping down on new COVID spikes among its billion-plus people. A U.S. and European recession have been forecast at some point this year as well, to offset the Chinese growth.It’s going to be an interesting year ahead in oil.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March delivery did a final trade of $81.96 on Friday after settling the session up $1.03, or 1.4%, at $81.64. For the week, it rose almost 2%.London-traded Brent crude for March delivery settled up $1.47, or 1.7%, at $87.66, after a session peak at $87.75. Brent was up 2.8% for the week.Oil: WTI Price OutlookWith WTI sustaining above the 5-Day Exponential Moving Average of $80.35, signs of further technical advances are emerging for U.S. crude, says Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“However, rebound towards the next major resistance of $93.74 requires a strong and sustained break above the 100-Day Simple Moving Average of $82.10 followed by a clearance through $84.70,” said Dixit.“Meanwhile, a short-term pull back towards the $79 support and a follow-up drop to $75.70 cannot be ruled out,” he added. “This again would very likely attract buyers.”Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The front-month February gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $3.134 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units, on Friday. It officially settled the session at $3.174, down 10.1 cents, or 3%.February gas fell to a 19-month low of $3.11 during the session, sending gas bulls up gasping for air on fears of the market tumbling to $2 levels. Fortunately, for the longs, the moment passed, with the $3 support holding.Natural gas: Price OutlookNatural gas could actually go on to break the much-watched $3 support in the coming week, though its drop below that could also be brief, said Dixit.“The current bearish drop could pause at $2.989 and a short-term rebound towards the resistance zone of $4.75 could start. The rebound will have several twists and turns en route to the $4.75 destination.”Dixit, however, said the upward projection was based on natural gas staying with its Fibonacci extension. “Natural gas is more of a weather-driven commodity now, where fundamentals rule, rather than technicals.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold for February delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,927.70 an ounce on Friday after settling the official session at $1,928.20, up $4.30, or 0.2%. It earlier hit a nine-month high at $1,938.85.Investing.com data shows that if February gold were to get past $1,950, its next major target would be the April 18 target of $2,003.Aside from its advance on Friday, the benchmark U.S. gold futures contract rose 0.3% for the week, adding to its 6.7% gain over four prior weeks.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled down $6.02, or 0.3%, at $1,926.22 on the day. Spot gold peaked at $1,937.54 on Friday - its highest since the $1,955.93 attained on April 25. Spot gold’s bigger target would be the March 10 target of $2,009.57.Gold: Price Outlook For a second week in a row, gold has closed above the $1,896 level, which marks a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the $2,070 high and the $1,614 low, said Dixit.“Prices are getting consistent support from the 5 Week Exponential Moving Average, which signals bullish continuation,” he said.“Going forth, a sustained move above $1,920 indicates presence of strong momentum and a sustained break above the recent high of $1,937.72 will be needed for an advance towards the next major resistance and target of $1,972.76, which marks the 78.6% Fibonacci level.”Dixit, however, said a drop below $1,920 would indicate a consolidation towards the $1915-$1905-$1896 support areas.“A sustained break below $1,896 will put the brakes on the current bullish momentum and a short correction towards $1,880 may then be witnessed.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesTexas regulator proposes power market overhaul after 2021 freezeYellen says Russian oil price cap could save African countries $6 billion annually]"

(CVE:DCMC) last year which is positive news for shareholders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quite-few-insiders-invested-dor-131220934.html,1674306740,STORY,['M'],"[Generally, when a single insider buys stock, it is usually not a big deal. However, when several insiders are buying, like in the case of Doré Copper Mining Corp. (CVE:DCMC), it sends a favourable message to the company's shareholders.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Doré Copper Mining The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Doré Copper MiningEarlier in the year, President Ernest Mast paid CA$0.58 per share in a CA$95k purchase. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being CA$0.32). Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.While Doré Copper Mining insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. They paid about CA$0.44 on average. I'd consider this a positive as it suggests insiders see value at around the current price. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Doré Copper Mining Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen a bit of insider buying at Doré Copper Mining. Insiders shelled out CA$43k for shares in that time. It's good to see the insider buying, as well as the lack of recent sellers. However, in this case the amount invested recently is quite small.Story continuesDoes Doré Copper Mining Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 7.0% of Doré Copper Mining shares, worth about CA$1.6m, according to our data. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. Overall, this level of ownership isn't that impressive, but it's certainly better than nothing!What Might The Insider Transactions At Doré Copper Mining Tell Us?Our data shows a little insider buying, but no selling, in the last three months. The net investment is not enough to encourage us much. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. We'd like to see bigger individual holdings. However, we don't see anything to make us think Doré Copper Mining insiders are doubting the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Doré Copper Mining.

If you want to see more stocks that have increased their dividends for over 25 years, go directly to 5 Stocks That Have Increased Their Dividends for Over 25 Years.In addition to buybacks, dividends are one of the main ways a company returns excess capital back to shareholders.Shareholders generally like companies to return their excess profits to prevent management from empire building by making bad acquisitions and to also be more efficient.Although not always the case especially during tough times, many companies try to pay a quarterly dividend.Like company profits, company dividends can fluctuate. If a company makes a lot of profits, management could decide to pay more of a dividend. If a company makes less profits or loses money, management could decide to pay less of a dividend or no dividend at all to conserve capital.Given many companies see their earnings shrink during recessions given slower demand, recessions are one of the periods where companies decrease their dividends.During recessions or tough times for a company, tough times, many companies also suspend their dividends.Given the pandemic in 2020 which greatly disrupted company earnings, the Great Recession during 2008 and 2009, and the early 2000 recession, few companies have consistently raised their dividends every year for 25 years or more.Companies that have raised their annual normal dividends for 25 years or more are also known as 'Dividend Aristocrats'.Although not necessarily the case for every company, generally most companies that raise their annual normal dividends every year for 25 years or more have pretty strong businesses that allow management to have the confidence to pay capital even during the pandemic or the Great Recession.Many of the companies that have raised their annual dividends for 25 years or more are also in the consumer staples sector where demand doesn't necessarily change as much for some companies.Story continues2023 could be a challenging year economically as many economists believe there could be a recession given the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates substantially in the last twelve months and could increase rates further this year. As a result, many companies, including Dividend Aristocrats could face headwinds in the near term.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of 15 Stocks That Have Increased Their Dividends for Over 25 Years, we selected stocks with competitive advantages that raised their dividends for 25 years or more.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of consecutive years that the company has raised its annual dividend according to Dividend.com.If two different companies tied in terms of the number of consecutive years they raised their annual dividends, we used their dividend yield according to Dividend.com as of January 20 as the tie breaker.We also included the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares of the same stock at the end of Q3.For those of you interested, also check out 10 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks.15 Stocks That Have Increased Their Dividends for Over 25 Years15.

44,8f615287-eaed-32b6-9684-4f8389946dc1,MA,2023-01-22,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-035540706.html,1674359740,STORY,"['GC=F', 'NG=F', 'CL=F']","[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com -- As oil bulls reveled last week in the end to COVID lockdowns in top crude importer China, inconspicuous remarks by Saudi and Moscow diplomats revealed the growing challenge for the OPEC+ heavyweights in finding a workaround to the G7 price cap on Russian oil.Saudi Arabia was “engaging with Russia over keeping oil prices relatively stable”, Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud told a Bloomberg interview in Riyadh on Thursday.The Saudi diplomat pointed out that it was the kingdom’s stewardship - and Moscow’s help - that enabled the 13-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its 10 allies to boost U.S. crude from minus $40 a barrel at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic breakout in 2020 to just above $130 after the Ukraine invasion in March last year. Global crude benchmark Brent went from under $16 to just below $140 in the same period.Al-Saud noted oil’s “relative stability” since those highs, comparing them with the “significant price swings” in “other energy sources” - like natural gas, which lost 50% over the past month. But even as he took a victory lap on that, he said there was more to be done: “We have a very important partnership with Russia on OPEC+ … that has delivered stability [to] the oil market … we are gonna engage with Russia on that.”Ahead of Al-Saud's comments, that same day, some 1,600 miles away in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak was telling state news agency TASS that Moscow “is not discussing with OPEC+ possibility of its oil production cuts”.Novak was responding to a question on whether the Kremlin will reduce oil output to demand a higher price for its Urals crude as the G7’s $60-per-barrel cap allows buyers to lowball the Russian product versus rival crude benchmarks such as the U.K. Brent, U.S. West Texas Intermediate, the Arab Light and Dubai Light.""No, we are not discussing such issues,"" Novak said.Story continuesAt a glance, the Saudi and Russian positions seemed disparate and to be addressing different matters. Al-Saud spoke about engaging Russia to keep oil prices stable while Novak ruled out production cuts by his country. However, anyone who knows the workings of OPEC+ will know how connected the two were; in essence, they were one and the same.""Uncoded, the Saudi message is that they want to sit with the Russians to tell them to stop selling Urals at prices that are so discounted that they are pulling Brent and Arab light down,” said John Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.“The Russians, in response, are basically saying ‘Don’t ask us to restrict our sales to help you.’ The big energy supply squeeze Russia had counted on this winter to pressure the West into paying more for oil and gas has evaporated with the warm weather we’ve had. The Kremlin probably needs whatever money it can get now for its oil. They’re also saying if they cut production now, they might not be able to get it back on.”Russia has historically maintained that oil wells drilled in permafrost could not be shut down easily, as they could freeze, requiring them to be drilled all over again when they are reopened. Oil analysts have called the cold weather claim one of the global oil industry’s biggest geopolitical bluffs. While Moscow did cut 20% of its output by teaming up with the Saudis in 2020, it has lately raised concerns again about the health of oil wells shuttered in the winter.To the Saudis, of course, there is no greater tool to manage supply-demand in oil other than production cuts, although the kingdom’s state oil company Aramco (TADAWUL:2222) routinely tweaks the official selling price of Arab light to obtain desired revenue. With global demand for oil cratering after the global coronavirus outbreak, the Saudis led Russia and the rest of OPEC+ to slash tens of millions of barrels of supply a day. Relatively few hikes have been announced to replace those cuts. The psychological pressure applied by the Saudis on oil consumers has been a major support for crude prices over the past two years.But the G7 price cap - which came into force on Dec. 5 - has been a game changer.With Urals’ selling price limited at $60 a barrel versus Brent’s Friday close of $87.63, a discount of at least $25 on paper applies for each barrel of prompt loading for the Russian crude benchmark.In the actual marketplace, the discounts are bigger, with the chief beneficiaries being India and China - the two biggest buyers of Russian crude.India bought an average of 1.2 million barrels of Urals a day in December, which was 33 times more than a year earlier and 29% more than in November. Discounts for Urals at Russia's western ports for sale to India under some deals widened to $32-$35 per barrel when freight wasn’t included, according to a Reuters report from Dec. 14.The Indians even exported fuel produced from Russian crude to New York via a high-seas transfer at one point, despite U.S. sanctions prohibiting the import of Russian-origin energy products, including refined fuels, distillates, crude oil, coal, and gas.Another Reuters report from Dec. 8 said China was paying the deepest discounts in months for Russian ESPO crude oil amid weak demand and poor refining margins. ESPO is a grade exported from the Russian Far East port of Kozmino and Chinese refiners are dominant clients for this.At least one ESPO cargo for early December arrival was sold to an independent Chinese refiner at a discount of $6 per barrel against the February Brent price on delivery-ex-ship (DES) basis, Reuters said, citing four traders with knowledge of the matter. That discount compared with a premium of about $1.80 fetched by an ESPO barrel in China three weeks prior to the deal. Brent’s plunge to a one-year low of just above $75 by Dec. 9 exacerbated the discount for Russian crude, though the U.K. crude’s rebound to near $88 this week would have narrowed the difference.The United States and its European allies - the chief proponents of the G7 price cap - are, meanwhile, delighted that Russian oil is going so cheaply and abundantly to the market.The West’s original idea was to limit the Kremlin's earnings from oil to slow the Russian military’s advance in Ukraine. That has begun working with the price cap.And while Western countries have banned Russian crude imports, they want to ensure they have enough refined products for their consumers and industries. India and China have stepped up petrol and diesel production with their bumper Urals purchases and some of those are finding their way to Western destinations outside of the U.S. The United States itself appears sufficiently stocked with enough refined products for the winter.Thus, when U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen toured Africa this past week, she took a victory lap on how well the G7 price cap was working. Aside from the West, some 17 of Africa’s net-oil importing countries could save a combined $6 billion annually from the price cap, which allowed them to use the discounted Russian oil as a basis for negotiating the purchase of any crude.So, what can those opposed to the price cap do?The Russians could demand a higher price for the oil they are selling to India and China. The question is how much more. If Brent continues to rally, an upward adjustment for Russian oil prices becomes natural. In the absence of that, Moscow might have to think about playing hardball with the only two countries it can conveniently sell its oil to amid the U.S. sanctions.The Saudis could announce a significant production cut by OPEC+ which the kingdom itself would largely carry, to avoid protests from others in the cartel already upset over the loss of market share. The Saudis announced in November a 2 million barrel per day cut that would take effect in December. Brent hit a three-month high of almost $100 a barrel on that. But Bloomberg later quoted a Saudi official as saying the kingdom shipped 7.21 million barrels a day in December, unchanged from November. “If OPEC+ announces another ‘output cut’, it could be another lie,” said Kilduff of Again Capital. “Most of the alliance members are unable to meet even their production targets. This market trades on headlines and the Saudis know they have enough suckers with the megaphone they wield.”And while China benefits from low Russian prices, it could save the day for OPEC if demand comes roaring back as projected in the world’s top oil importer. But the China rebound story is also contingent on how successful it is in clamping down on new COVID spikes among its billion-plus people. A U.S. and European recession have been forecast at some point this year as well, to offset the Chinese growth.It’s going to be an interesting year ahead in oil.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March delivery did a final trade of $81.96 on Friday after settling the session up $1.03, or 1.4%, at $81.64. For the week, it rose almost 2%.London-traded Brent crude for March delivery settled up $1.47, or 1.7%, at $87.66, after a session peak at $87.75. Brent was up 2.8% for the week.Oil: WTI Price OutlookWith WTI sustaining above the 5-Day Exponential Moving Average of $80.35, signs of further technical advances are emerging for U.S. crude, says Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“However, rebound towards the next major resistance of $93.74 requires a strong and sustained break above the 100-Day Simple Moving Average of $82.10 followed by a clearance through $84.70,” said Dixit.“Meanwhile, a short-term pull back towards the $79 support and a follow-up drop to $75.70 cannot be ruled out,” he added. “This again would very likely attract buyers.”Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The front-month February gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $3.134 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units, on Friday. It officially settled the session at $3.174, down 10.1 cents, or 3%.February gas fell to a 19-month low of $3.11 during the session, sending gas bulls up gasping for air on fears of the market tumbling to $2 levels. Fortunately, for the longs, the moment passed, with the $3 support holding.Natural gas: Price OutlookNatural gas could actually go on to break the much-watched $3 support in the coming week, though its drop below that could also be brief, said Dixit.“The current bearish drop could pause at $2.989 and a short-term rebound towards the resistance zone of $4.75 could start. The rebound will have several twists and turns en route to the $4.75 destination.”Dixit, however, said the upward projection was based on natural gas staying with its Fibonacci extension. “Natural gas is more of a weather-driven commodity now, where fundamentals rule, rather than technicals.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold for February delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,927.70 an ounce on Friday after settling the official session at $1,928.20, up $4.30, or 0.2%. It earlier hit a nine-month high at $1,938.85.Investing.com data shows that if February gold were to get past $1,950, its next major target would be the April 18 target of $2,003.Aside from its advance on Friday, the benchmark U.S. gold futures contract rose 0.3% for the week, adding to its 6.7% gain over four prior weeks.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled down $6.02, or 0.3%, at $1,926.22 on the day. Spot gold peaked at $1,937.54 on Friday - its highest since the $1,955.93 attained on April 25. Spot gold’s bigger target would be the March 10 target of $2,009.57.Gold: Price Outlook For a second week in a row, gold has closed above the $1,896 level, which marks a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the $2,070 high and the $1,614 low, said Dixit.“Prices are getting consistent support from the 5 Week Exponential Moving Average, which signals bullish continuation,” he said.“Going forth, a sustained move above $1,920 indicates presence of strong momentum and a sustained break above the recent high of $1,937.72 will be needed for an advance towards the next major resistance and target of $1,972.76, which marks the 78.6% Fibonacci level.”Dixit, however, said a drop below $1,920 would indicate a consolidation towards the $1915-$1905-$1896 support areas.“A sustained break below $1,896 will put the brakes on the current bullish momentum and a short correction towards $1,880 may then be witnessed.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesTexas regulator proposes power market overhaul after 2021 freezeYellen says Russian oil price cap could save African countries $6 billion annually]"

(NYSE:PFE) has announced that it will be increasing its periodic dividend on the 3rd of March to $0.41, which will be 2.5% higher than last year's comparable payment amount of $0.40. This will take the annual payment to 3.5% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. See our latest analysis for Pfizer Pfizer's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Before making this announcement, Pfizer was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 37.9%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 51%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendPfizer Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.88 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.60. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.2% over that duration. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that Pfizer has grown earnings per share at 27% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.Pfizer Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For instance, the price of Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) stock is up an impressive 111% over the last five years. It's also up 13% in about a month.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Target There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Target managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.4% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 16% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Target's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Target's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Target, it has a TSR of 137% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Target shareholders are down 24% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 10%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 19% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 4 warning signs for Target (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin.Dana Nolan: Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer and non-GAAP information, are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&amp;A. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John.John Turner: Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Let me begin by saying that we're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. Earlier this morning, we reported full year earnings of $2.1 billion, reflecting record pretax pre-provision income of $3.1 billion, adjusted positive operating leverage of 7% and industry-leading returns on both average tangible common equity and total shareholder return. Our results speak to and underscore the comprehensive work that's taken place over the past decade to position the Company to generate consistent, sustainable long-term performance. We have enhanced our credit, interest rate and operational risk management processes and platforms while sharpening our focus on risk-adjusted returns and capital allocation.We made investments in markets, technology, talent and capabilities to diversify our revenue base and enhance our offerings to customers. For example, investments in our treasury management products and services led to record revenue this year. Similarly, our Wealth Management segment also generated record revenue despite volatile market conditions. And now we're seeing positive results of our comprehensive strategy. Over the course of the year, we grew revenue and average loans while prudently managing expenses, further illustrating the successful execution of our strategic plan. So, as we enter 2023, it is from a position of strength. Our business customers have strong balance sheets. They have benefited from population migration and many continue to carry more liquidity than in the past.Story continuesOur consumer customer base remains healthy. Deposit balances remain strong and credit card payments remain elevated. The job market continues to be solid with approximately two open jobs available for each unemployed person across the Regions' footprint. We have a robust credit risk management framework, and a disciplined and dynamic approach to managing concentration risk. Our portfolios are more balanced and diverse than at any point in the past. We have a strong balance sheet that's well positioned to perform an array of economic conditions. We have solid capital and liquidity position to support balance sheet growth and strategic investments. And most importantly, we have a solid strategic plan, an outstanding team and a proven track record of successful execution.So as we look ahead, although there is uncertainty, we feel good about how we're positioned. Now, Dave will provide some highlights regarding the quarter.Photo by Markus Winkler on UnsplashDavid Turner: Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average loans increased 1% sequentially or 9% year-over-year. Average business loans increased 2% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting high-quality broad-based growth. Average consumer loans declined 1% as growth in mortgage, Interbank and credit card was offset by the strategic sale of consumer loans late in the third quarter and continued runoff of exit portfolios. Looking forward, we expect 2023 ending loan growth of approximately 4%. From a deposit standpoint, as expected, deposits continued to normalize during the quarter, consistent with a rapidly rising rate environment. Average total consumer balances were modestly lower, primarily driven by higher balance customers seeking marginal investment alternatives.Meanwhile, the median consumer balance remains relatively stable, still about 50% above pre-pandemic levels. Normalization was more pronounced in average corporate and commercial deposits, which were down 2% during the quarter. As anticipated, our business clients continue to optimize the level and structure of their liquidity position. We experienced remixing away from noninterest-bearing deposits to other options, both on and off balance sheet, including those offered through our treasury management platform. Ending deposit balances have declined approximately $7 billion year-over-year, in line with our previously provided 2022 expectations. Looking forward, we do anticipate further deposit declines of approximately $3 billion to $5 billion in the first half of 2023, reflecting continued Federal Reserve balance sheet normalization, seasonal trends and late-cycle rate-seeking behavior.We expect to experience stabilization of deposit balances midyear with the potential for modest growth in the second half of the year. Our deliberate approach to managing liquidity allows for deposit normalization and growth in the balance sheet without the need for material wholesale borrowings in the near term. So, let's shift to net interest income and margin. Reflecting our asset-sensitive profile, net interest income grew to a record $1.4 billion this quarter, representing an 11% increase while reported net interest margin increased 46 basis points to 3.99%, its highest level in the last 15 years. While deposit repricing continues to accelerate, the cycle-to-date beta remains low at 14%. Importantly, our guidance for 2023 assumes a 35% full-cycle beta by year-end.There is uncertainty regarding full cycle deposit betas for the industry. However, we remain confident that our deposit composition will provide a meaningful competitive advantage. Growth in net interest income is expected to continue until the Federal Reserve reaches the end of its tightening cycle. Once the Fed pauses, we would expect deposit costs to continue increasing for a couple of more quarters. This equates to 1% to 3% net interest income growth in the first quarter and 13% to 15% growth in 2023, assuming the December 31st forward rate curve. Earlier in 2022, we added a meaningful amount of hedges focused on protecting 2024 and 2025. The swaps become effective in the latter half of 2023 and 2024 and generally have a term of three years.Activity in the fourth quarter focused on extending that protection beyond 2025. We will look for attractive opportunities to continue to expand this protection. We have constructed the balance sheet to support a net interest margin range of 3.6% to 4% over the coming years, even if interest rates move back towards 1%. If rates remain elevated, our reported net interest margin is projected to surpass the high end of the range until deposits fully reprice. So, let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Reported noninterest income includes $50 million of insurance proceeds related to a third quarter regulatory settlement. Excluding that, adjusted noninterest income declined 9% from the prior quarter as stability in wealth management income and a modest increase in card and ATM fees were offset by declines in other categories, mainly mortgage and capital markets.Service charges declined 3% due primarily to three fewer days in the fourth quarter versus the third. We expect to offer a grace period feature to cover overdrafts around midyear 2023 and when combined with our previously implemented enhancements, will result in full year service charges of approximately $550 million. Within capital markets, increases in M&amp;A fees were offset by declines in all other categories, including a negative $11 million CVA and DVA adjustment. Despite an increase in servicing income, elevated interest rates and seasonally lower production drove total mortgage income lower during the quarter. With respect to outlook, we expect full year 2023 adjusted total revenue to be up 8% to 10% compared to 2022. Let's move on to noninterest expense.Reported professional and legal expenses declined significantly driven by charges related to the settlement of a regulatory matter in the third quarter. Excluding this and other adjusted items, adjusted noninterest expenses increased 2% compared to the prior quarter. Salaries and benefits increased 2%, primarily due to an increase in associate headcount during the fourth quarter and higher benefits expense. Equipment and software expenses increased 4%, reflecting increased technology investments. The fourth quarter level does provide a reasonable quarterly run rate for 2023. We expect full year 2023 adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 4.5% to 5.5%, and we expect to generate positive adjusted operating leverage of approximately 4%. From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance remains broadly stable while experiencing expected normalization.Net charge-offs were 29 basis points in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the third quarter consumer loan sale, adjusted full year net charge-offs were 22 basis points. Nonperforming loans remained relatively stable quarter-over-quarter and were below pre-pandemic levels. Provision expense was $112 million this quarter. While the allowance for credit loss ratio remained unchanged at 1.63%, the increase to the allowance was due primarily to economic conditions, normalizing credit from historically low levels and loan growth. These increases were partially offset by the elimination of the hurricane-related reserves established last quarter. Just to remind you, we believe our normalized charge-offs based on our current book of business should range from 35 to 45 basis points on an annual basis.However, due to the strength of the consumer and to businesses, we expect our full year 2023 net charge-off ratio to be in the range of 25 to 35 basis points. From a capital standpoint, we ended the quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio at an estimated 9.6%, reflecting solid capital generation through earnings, partially offset by continued loan growth. Given the uncertain economic outlook, we plan to manage capital levels near the upper end of our 9.25% to 9.75% operating range over the near term. So, in closing, we delivered strong results in 2022, despite volatile economic conditions. We are in some of the strongest markets in the country, and while we remain vigilant to indicators of potential market contraction, we will continue to be a source of stability to our customers.Pretax, pre-provision income remains strong, expenses are well controlled, credit remains broadly stable, and capital and liquidity are solid. And with that, we'll move to the Q&amp;A portion of the call.See also Dividend Aristocrats Ranked: Top 15 and 12 Biggest Cloud Providers By Market CapTo continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

65,8f615287-eaed-32b6-9684-4f8389946dc1,MAR,2023-01-22,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-035540706.html,1674359740,STORY,"['GC=F', 'NG=F', 'CL=F']","[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com -- As oil bulls reveled last week in the end to COVID lockdowns in top crude importer China, inconspicuous remarks by Saudi and Moscow diplomats revealed the growing challenge for the OPEC+ heavyweights in finding a workaround to the G7 price cap on Russian oil.Saudi Arabia was “engaging with Russia over keeping oil prices relatively stable”, Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud told a Bloomberg interview in Riyadh on Thursday.The Saudi diplomat pointed out that it was the kingdom’s stewardship - and Moscow’s help - that enabled the 13-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its 10 allies to boost U.S. crude from minus $40 a barrel at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic breakout in 2020 to just above $130 after the Ukraine invasion in March last year. Global crude benchmark Brent went from under $16 to just below $140 in the same period.Al-Saud noted oil’s “relative stability” since those highs, comparing them with the “significant price swings” in “other energy sources” - like natural gas, which lost 50% over the past month. But even as he took a victory lap on that, he said there was more to be done: “We have a very important partnership with Russia on OPEC+ … that has delivered stability [to] the oil market … we are gonna engage with Russia on that.”Ahead of Al-Saud's comments, that same day, some 1,600 miles away in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak was telling state news agency TASS that Moscow “is not discussing with OPEC+ possibility of its oil production cuts”.Novak was responding to a question on whether the Kremlin will reduce oil output to demand a higher price for its Urals crude as the G7’s $60-per-barrel cap allows buyers to lowball the Russian product versus rival crude benchmarks such as the U.K. Brent, U.S. West Texas Intermediate, the Arab Light and Dubai Light.""No, we are not discussing such issues,"" Novak said.Story continuesAt a glance, the Saudi and Russian positions seemed disparate and to be addressing different matters. Al-Saud spoke about engaging Russia to keep oil prices stable while Novak ruled out production cuts by his country. However, anyone who knows the workings of OPEC+ will know how connected the two were; in essence, they were one and the same.""Uncoded, the Saudi message is that they want to sit with the Russians to tell them to stop selling Urals at prices that are so discounted that they are pulling Brent and Arab light down,” said John Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.“The Russians, in response, are basically saying ‘Don’t ask us to restrict our sales to help you.’ The big energy supply squeeze Russia had counted on this winter to pressure the West into paying more for oil and gas has evaporated with the warm weather we’ve had. The Kremlin probably needs whatever money it can get now for its oil. They’re also saying if they cut production now, they might not be able to get it back on.”Russia has historically maintained that oil wells drilled in permafrost could not be shut down easily, as they could freeze, requiring them to be drilled all over again when they are reopened. Oil analysts have called the cold weather claim one of the global oil industry’s biggest geopolitical bluffs. While Moscow did cut 20% of its output by teaming up with the Saudis in 2020, it has lately raised concerns again about the health of oil wells shuttered in the winter.To the Saudis, of course, there is no greater tool to manage supply-demand in oil other than production cuts, although the kingdom’s state oil company Aramco (TADAWUL:2222) routinely tweaks the official selling price of Arab light to obtain desired revenue. With global demand for oil cratering after the global coronavirus outbreak, the Saudis led Russia and the rest of OPEC+ to slash tens of millions of barrels of supply a day. Relatively few hikes have been announced to replace those cuts. The psychological pressure applied by the Saudis on oil consumers has been a major support for crude prices over the past two years.But the G7 price cap - which came into force on Dec. 5 - has been a game changer.With Urals’ selling price limited at $60 a barrel versus Brent’s Friday close of $87.63, a discount of at least $25 on paper applies for each barrel of prompt loading for the Russian crude benchmark.In the actual marketplace, the discounts are bigger, with the chief beneficiaries being India and China - the two biggest buyers of Russian crude.India bought an average of 1.2 million barrels of Urals a day in December, which was 33 times more than a year earlier and 29% more than in November. Discounts for Urals at Russia's western ports for sale to India under some deals widened to $32-$35 per barrel when freight wasn’t included, according to a Reuters report from Dec. 14.The Indians even exported fuel produced from Russian crude to New York via a high-seas transfer at one point, despite U.S. sanctions prohibiting the import of Russian-origin energy products, including refined fuels, distillates, crude oil, coal, and gas.Another Reuters report from Dec. 8 said China was paying the deepest discounts in months for Russian ESPO crude oil amid weak demand and poor refining margins. ESPO is a grade exported from the Russian Far East port of Kozmino and Chinese refiners are dominant clients for this.At least one ESPO cargo for early December arrival was sold to an independent Chinese refiner at a discount of $6 per barrel against the February Brent price on delivery-ex-ship (DES) basis, Reuters said, citing four traders with knowledge of the matter. That discount compared with a premium of about $1.80 fetched by an ESPO barrel in China three weeks prior to the deal. Brent’s plunge to a one-year low of just above $75 by Dec. 9 exacerbated the discount for Russian crude, though the U.K. crude’s rebound to near $88 this week would have narrowed the difference.The United States and its European allies - the chief proponents of the G7 price cap - are, meanwhile, delighted that Russian oil is going so cheaply and abundantly to the market.The West’s original idea was to limit the Kremlin's earnings from oil to slow the Russian military’s advance in Ukraine. That has begun working with the price cap.And while Western countries have banned Russian crude imports, they want to ensure they have enough refined products for their consumers and industries. India and China have stepped up petrol and diesel production with their bumper Urals purchases and some of those are finding their way to Western destinations outside of the U.S. The United States itself appears sufficiently stocked with enough refined products for the winter.Thus, when U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen toured Africa this past week, she took a victory lap on how well the G7 price cap was working. Aside from the West, some 17 of Africa’s net-oil importing countries could save a combined $6 billion annually from the price cap, which allowed them to use the discounted Russian oil as a basis for negotiating the purchase of any crude.So, what can those opposed to the price cap do?The Russians could demand a higher price for the oil they are selling to India and China. The question is how much more. If Brent continues to rally, an upward adjustment for Russian oil prices becomes natural. In the absence of that, Moscow might have to think about playing hardball with the only two countries it can conveniently sell its oil to amid the U.S. sanctions.The Saudis could announce a significant production cut by OPEC+ which the kingdom itself would largely carry, to avoid protests from others in the cartel already upset over the loss of market share. The Saudis announced in November a 2 million barrel per day cut that would take effect in December. Brent hit a three-month high of almost $100 a barrel on that. But Bloomberg later quoted a Saudi official as saying the kingdom shipped 7.21 million barrels a day in December, unchanged from November. “If OPEC+ announces another ‘output cut’, it could be another lie,” said Kilduff of Again Capital. “Most of the alliance members are unable to meet even their production targets. This market trades on headlines and the Saudis know they have enough suckers with the megaphone they wield.”And while China benefits from low Russian prices, it could save the day for OPEC if demand comes roaring back as projected in the world’s top oil importer. But the China rebound story is also contingent on how successful it is in clamping down on new COVID spikes among its billion-plus people. A U.S. and European recession have been forecast at some point this year as well, to offset the Chinese growth.It’s going to be an interesting year ahead in oil.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March delivery did a final trade of $81.96 on Friday after settling the session up $1.03, or 1.4%, at $81.64. For the week, it rose almost 2%.London-traded Brent crude for March delivery settled up $1.47, or 1.7%, at $87.66, after a session peak at $87.75. Brent was up 2.8% for the week.Oil: WTI Price OutlookWith WTI sustaining above the 5-Day Exponential Moving Average of $80.35, signs of further technical advances are emerging for U.S. crude, says Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“However, rebound towards the next major resistance of $93.74 requires a strong and sustained break above the 100-Day Simple Moving Average of $82.10 followed by a clearance through $84.70,” said Dixit.“Meanwhile, a short-term pull back towards the $79 support and a follow-up drop to $75.70 cannot be ruled out,” he added. “This again would very likely attract buyers.”Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The front-month February gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $3.134 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units, on Friday. It officially settled the session at $3.174, down 10.1 cents, or 3%.February gas fell to a 19-month low of $3.11 during the session, sending gas bulls up gasping for air on fears of the market tumbling to $2 levels. Fortunately, for the longs, the moment passed, with the $3 support holding.Natural gas: Price OutlookNatural gas could actually go on to break the much-watched $3 support in the coming week, though its drop below that could also be brief, said Dixit.“The current bearish drop could pause at $2.989 and a short-term rebound towards the resistance zone of $4.75 could start. The rebound will have several twists and turns en route to the $4.75 destination.”Dixit, however, said the upward projection was based on natural gas staying with its Fibonacci extension. “Natural gas is more of a weather-driven commodity now, where fundamentals rule, rather than technicals.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold for February delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,927.70 an ounce on Friday after settling the official session at $1,928.20, up $4.30, or 0.2%. It earlier hit a nine-month high at $1,938.85.Investing.com data shows that if February gold were to get past $1,950, its next major target would be the April 18 target of $2,003.Aside from its advance on Friday, the benchmark U.S. gold futures contract rose 0.3% for the week, adding to its 6.7% gain over four prior weeks.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled down $6.02, or 0.3%, at $1,926.22 on the day. Spot gold peaked at $1,937.54 on Friday - its highest since the $1,955.93 attained on April 25. Spot gold’s bigger target would be the March 10 target of $2,009.57.Gold: Price Outlook For a second week in a row, gold has closed above the $1,896 level, which marks a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the $2,070 high and the $1,614 low, said Dixit.“Prices are getting consistent support from the 5 Week Exponential Moving Average, which signals bullish continuation,” he said.“Going forth, a sustained move above $1,920 indicates presence of strong momentum and a sustained break above the recent high of $1,937.72 will be needed for an advance towards the next major resistance and target of $1,972.76, which marks the 78.6% Fibonacci level.”Dixit, however, said a drop below $1,920 would indicate a consolidation towards the $1915-$1905-$1896 support areas.“A sustained break below $1,896 will put the brakes on the current bullish momentum and a short correction towards $1,880 may then be witnessed.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesTexas regulator proposes power market overhaul after 2021 freezeYellen says Russian oil price cap could save African countries $6 billion annually]"

If you want to see more stocks that have increased their dividends for over 25 years, go directly to 5 Stocks That Have Increased Their Dividends for Over 25 Years.In addition to buybacks, dividends are one of the main ways a company returns excess capital back to shareholders.Shareholders generally like companies to return their excess profits to prevent management from empire building by making bad acquisitions and to also be more efficient.Although not always the case especially during tough times, many companies try to pay a quarterly dividend.Like company profits, company dividends can fluctuate. If a company makes a lot of profits, management could decide to pay more of a dividend. If a company makes less profits or loses money, management could decide to pay less of a dividend or no dividend at all to conserve capital.Given many companies see their earnings shrink during recessions given slower demand, recessions are one of the periods where companies decrease their dividends.During recessions or tough times for a company, tough times, many companies also suspend their dividends.Given the pandemic in 2020 which greatly disrupted company earnings, the Great Recession during 2008 and 2009, and the early 2000 recession, few companies have consistently raised their dividends every year for 25 years or more.Companies that have raised their annual normal dividends for 25 years or more are also known as 'Dividend Aristocrats'.Although not necessarily the case for every company, generally most companies that raise their annual normal dividends every year for 25 years or more have pretty strong businesses that allow management to have the confidence to pay capital even during the pandemic or the Great Recession.Many of the companies that have raised their annual dividends for 25 years or more are also in the consumer staples sector where demand doesn't necessarily change as much for some companies.Story continues2023 could be a challenging year economically as many economists believe there could be a recession given the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates substantially in the last twelve months and could increase rates further this year.

This makes the dividend yield 5.4%, which is above the industry average. View our latest analysis for ONEOK ONEOK's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 104% of what it was earning and 91% of cash flows. The company could be more focused on returning cash to shareholders, but this could indicate that growth opportunities are few and far between.Earnings per share is forecast to rise by 35.5% over the next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continues, the payout ratio in 12 months could be 83% which is a bit high but can definitely be sustainable.historic-dividendONEOK Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.22 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $3.74. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 12% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.ONEOK Might Find It Hard To Grow Its DividendInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. ONEOK has impressed us by growing EPS at 17% per year over the past five years. However, the payout ratio is very high, not leaving much room for growth of the dividend in the future.Our Thoughts On ONEOK's DividendOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think ONEOK will make a great income stock. We can't deny that the payments have been very stable, but we are a little bit worried about the very high payout ratio. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for ONEOK (of which 1 is concerning!) you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Zimmer Biomet Holdings. View our latest analysis for Zimmer Biomet Holdings ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Zimmer Biomet Holdings?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Zimmer Biomet Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Zimmer Biomet Holdings, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power.

BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 10% of common stock, and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. holds about 5.0% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 13 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Zimmer Biomet HoldingsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$23m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 10% stake in Zimmer Biomet Holdings. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

94,074dce9b-2a0a-3521-9ebb-a22260daf20e,VRTX,2023-01-22,10 Best Healthcare Stocks For Recession,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-healthcare-stocks-recession-233446293.html,1674344086,STORY,"['CAH', 'VRTX', 'NBIX', 'ABC', 'UTHR']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 10 best healthcare stocks for recession. You can skip this part and go to 5 Best Healthcare Stocks For Recession.The healthcare sector in 2022 outperformed the market despite several headwinds and a negative macroeconomic backdrop. Data shows that the Health Care Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund (XLV) fell just 3.5% in the year, compared to a whopping 20% drop for SPY. The overall sector was lifted by several positive news from major and small healthcare and biotech companies in terms of their pipelines. The healthcare sector also consists of many established players which have been paying consistent dividends to their shareholders.The healthcare sector was one of the biggest losers during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. But 2022 saw major companies in the sector regain their footing as patients came back to doctors’ offices to make up for the skipped checkups during the pandemic days. According to a November 2022 report from WSJ, the pandemic has led to about $150 billion in sales from new Covid-19 products, including diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics. The report also quoted UnitedHealth Group’s CFO, who said in a conference call that the company was “encouraged” to see people actively obtaining preventive screenings.Major healthcare stocks that gained value in 2022 and are also set for strong performance this year include McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health and Cigna. You will see these stocks in our list, along with several other players which are strong stock picks for recessions.Healthcare stocks tend to remain steady when others are wavering because these companies can often pass on higher costs to customers during inflation. The healthcare sector is also receiving positive outlook from major analyst firms in the Wall Street. For example, in December, investment firm Citi gave an Overweight rating to the sector and said:“While tempted to downgrade into this past year’s relative outperformance, the decision is stick with the sector’s defensive connotation.”Story continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to find large-cap healthcare companies which posted positive stock performance (at least 20% gain) in 2022. For each stock we have mentioned its growth catalysts and why is it a good stock pick for recessions. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We used Insider Monkey’s database of 920 funds to gauge that metric for each company.10 Best Healthcare Stocks For Recession10. Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:NBIX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44One of the best performers in the healthcare sector in 2022 was California-based Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:NBIX). Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.

Management provided a new profit outlook for Fiscal 2023 and announced an improvement plan for the medical segment. We are encouraged by these changes and think CAH’s underlying fundamentals and competitive advantages around preventative maintenance screenings and medication management will continue to improve. We believe valuations of health care companies like CAH that focus on cost optimization and promote technological efficiency across the supply chain will be rewarded over the long term.”8. AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE:ABC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE:ABC) is a strong healthcare stock whose valuation looks depressed.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) is a Massachusetts-based biotech company. In December, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) received go-ahead from the FDA for its IND application for VX-522, an mRNA candidate for cystic fibrosis. The treatment is intended for about 5,000 patients who do not benefit from a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator.

In addition to solid growth in CF revenues that has driven better-than-expected results, positive progress in its development pipeline has lifted shares. At the time of our Q2 2021 purchase, the stock was under pressure due to regulatory hurdles and Vertex’s decision not to pursue late-stage development of VX-864 after an unexpectedly unfavorable outcome. VX-864 is designed to treat alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), which is an inherited disorder with a strong correlation to pediatric liver disease. Irrespective of Vertex’s AATD pipeline, the company has nearly two decades of patent protection remaining for its CF franchise. Management maintains a healthy reserve of cash and is focusing on research and development. We believe near-term growth is likely to be driven by Vertex’s expanding geographic presence and expansion of medicines to lower age groups, with long-term gains arising from the company’s diversifying pipeline.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Healthcare Stocks For Recession.

However, we decided to pay attention to the company's fundamentals which don't appear to give a clear sign about the company's financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Mohawk Industries'  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Mohawk Industries How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Mohawk Industries is:2.3% = US$181m ÷ US$7.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.02 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Mohawk Industries' Earnings Growth And 2.3% ROEAs you can see, Mohawk Industries' ROE looks pretty weak. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 23%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 3.9% seen by Mohawk Industries over the last five years is not surprising. We believe that there also might be other aspects that are negatively influencing the company's earnings prospects. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Mohawk Industries' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 30% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is MHK worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether MHK is currently mispriced by the market.Is Mohawk Industries Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Because Mohawk Industries doesn't pay any dividends, we infer that it is retaining all of its profits, which is rather perplexing when you consider the fact that there is no earnings growth to show for it. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.SummaryIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Mohawk Industries' performance. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

97,3e31618c-d0a5-3f45-af2e-6c9907d5de6c,INCY,2023-01-22,7 Biotech Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 10 Years,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-biotech-stocks-rich-10-204449431.html,1674074689,STORY,"['CRSP', 'INCY', 'CVAC', 'PFE', 'ABBV', 'EXEL', 'SRPT']","[If you have the patience to go through wild undulations, then you may be a candidate for biotech stocks that will make you rich in 10 years. Even among the most established biotechnology firms, they’re seemingly one news item away from disaster. Further, the smaller enterprises in this exciting arena tend to be extremely unpredictable.Nevertheless, because the sector tends to run on its own fundamentals rather than abiding exclusively by traditional economic metrics, the biotech stocks that will make you rich in 10 years may surprisingly enjoy relevancy right now. With so many concerns about monetary policy and geopolitical rumblings, it’s nice to trade in a roughly independent ecosystem.Most importantly, advanced biopharmaceuticals may one day spark groundbreaking health-related innovations. Thus, it makes sense to have some speculation funds directed at this segment. So, without any more delay, below are the biotech stocks that will make you rich in 10 years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsABBVAbbVie$149.57PFEPfizer$45.08INCYIncyte$82.14EXELExelixis$16.40CRSPCRISPR Therapeutics$51.00SRPTSarepta$128.73CVACCureVac$9.50AbbVie (ABBV)Phot of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effectSource: shutterstock.com/Romix ImageOne of the giants in the pharmaceutical space is AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). This company ranks among the biotech stocks that will make you rich in 10 years mainly because of its Allergan acquisition. Through the takeover, AbbVie now commands the wrinkle-fighting treatment Botox. While such “superficial” treatments for lack of a better word lost relevance during the coronavirus-fueled quarantines, the gradual return to full normalization should lift Botox sales.Two fundamental factors come to mind. First of course is the pivot toward return-to-office policies. With Disney (NYSE:DIS) recently cracking the whip regarding its newly stated in-office policy, other enterprises will likely follow suit. Naturally, the return of physical interactions should boost Botox’s revenue. Another factor is that a decade from now, the oldest millennials will be in their 50s. And the oldest members of Gen Z will be steadily marching to their 40s. Demographically, then, ABBV appears to be one of the biotech stocks that will make you rich in 10 years.Story continuesPfizer (PFE)Brown glass pill bottle on its side showing white pills inside, with other pill bottles behind it representing MACK stock.Source: shutterstock.com/ChampheiMaking a name for itself for forwarding a messenger-RNA-based vaccine to combat the Covid-19 crisis, biopharma giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) offers many potential relevancies. By leveraging the innovation to research and develop vaccines for other infectious diseases, Pfizer can profitably leverage its newfound acumen. Therefore, it may well be one of the best biotech stocks that will make you rich in 10 years.However, it must be said that PFE recently took it on the chin based on a Wells Fargo analyst downgrade. Essentially, the current run rate for Pfizer’s Covid antiviral drug and its vaccine might not meet consensus revenue targets. Therefore, both investors and market observers may need to reset their future expectations, which doesn’t bode well for PFE. Nevertheless, among covering analysts, Pfizer still commands a moderate buy consensus view. Further, their average price target implies a 15% upside potential. However, should the company continue to develop its mRNA technology, the sky may be the limit.Thus, it’s worth consideration for biotech stocks that will make you rich in 10 years.Incyte (INCY)Modern Medical Research Laboratory: Two Scientists Wearing Face Masks use Microscope, Analyse Sample in Petri Dish, Talk. Advanced Scientific Lab for Medicine, Biotechnology. Blue Color. KZR stock.Source: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comFocused on finding new ways to manage rare and often hard-to-treat diseases, Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) carries both significant potential and risk. Still, INCY ranks among the biotech stocks that will make you rich in 10 years because of its proven history of getting therapeutics approved. The company covers a wide area of needs, including oncology, inflammation, and autoimmunity.As you may know, if you spent time in the biotech space, it’s often wildly unpredictable. Therefore, what I appreciate about Incyte is its financial stability. For instance, the company features a cash-to-debt ratio of 70.75 times, ranking above 72% of the biotech industry. As well, its Altman Z-Score (a measure of bankruptcy risk) pings at 9.85, well into the safe zone.Objectively as well, Incyte enjoys an undervalued investment profile. Currently, the market prices INCY at just under 18 times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median stands at over 27 times. Finally, while the immediate sentiment among hedge funds may be negative, in the long run, the smart money considerably added INCY to its portfolio since the fourth quarter of 2020.Exelixis (EXEL)Medical technology network team meeting concept. Doctor hand working smart phone modern digital tablet laptop computer graphics chart interface, sun flare effect photo, PTESource: everything possible / Shutterstock.comOncology specialist Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) might not immediately attract investors seeking biotech stocks that will make you rich in 10 years. For example, its trailing-year performance of 6% below breakeven seems dull: it’s not too steep of a loss to spark contrarian interest but the existence of red ink may worry more conservative investors.However, Exelixis – which depends on its blockbuster cancer drug Cabometyx – still has a place among compelling biotech enterprises. Cabometyx received approval to treat first- and second-line renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Representing one of the deadliest growing solid tumor cancers, Exelixis commands powerful relevancies. As well, patient demand globally for treatment options will rise significantly, according to Data Bridge Market Research.Just as well, Exelixis enjoys solid financials. Undergirded by a stable balance sheet, the company carries strong profitability metrics. For instance, its net margin stands at nearly 19%, above 85% of the competition. As well, the market prices shares at only 17.6-times forward earnings, below the sector median of over 27 times. Therefore, it’s one of the biotech stocks that will make you rich in 10 years.CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP)Source: ShutterstockAmong the most controversial companies, CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) nevertheless makes a case for biotech stocks that will make you rich in 10 years. To be completely transparent, CRSP represents a largely aspirational narrative. Similar to many other clinical-stage biotech firms, Crispr sits far from profitability. At the same time, its flagship product might change that.In partnership with Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), Crispr engages in the potential treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT). According to Fortune Business Insights, the market for treating SCD may grow to $8.75 billion in 2029, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.4% from 2022. Regarding TDT, the treatment market featured a valuation of $411.8 million in 2021. Experts at Coherent Market Insights project that the segment can expand at a CAGR of 7.8% between 2021 through 2028.While Crispr again doesn’t enjoy robust financials, analysts apparently believe it’s one of the biotech stocks that will make you rich in 10 years. Presently, CRSP enjoys a moderate buy consensus view. Also, the average price target implies an upside of slightly over 82%.Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT)Biochemical/biotech research scientist team working with microscopeSource: Mongkolchon Akesin / Shutterstock.comTo be clear from the get-go, Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRPT) ranks among the riskiest names in the biotech ecosystem. It’s not that the company is bad – far from it. Rather, it’s good, perhaps too good. In the trailing year, shares have nearly doubled. Therefore, it raises the prospect that interested buyers now may end up holding the bag.Still, from a fundamental perspective, Sarepta deserves a closer look as one of the biotech stocks that will make you rich in 10 years. Recently, the company made significant progress regarding its approved products targeting Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). According to Allied Market Research, the global DMD treatment market featured a valuation of $1.3 billion. However, the segment may grow to $2.07 billion by 2031.Because DMD is a progressive and fatal disease, Sarepta commands powerful relevancies. Further, should medical breakthroughs materialize in the next decade, SRPT could still enjoy a stratospheric upside. Finally, Sarepta benefits from a strong buy consensus rating among covering analysts. This underscores why many experts believe SRPT is one of the biotech stocks that will make you rich in 10 years.CureVac (CVAC)half of a double helix molecule of DNASource: ShutterstockFor what may be the riskiest idea on this list, CureVac (NASDAQ:CVAC) nevertheless presents intrigue for contrarian speculators. One of the biotechs that forwarded advanced solutions for Covid-19, CureVac continued to invest in the underlying mRNA technology. Recently, the company managed to pop higher based on positive data for its Covid and flu vaccines.As I pointed out, CureVac – thought a speculative venture – may enjoy relevancies associated with infectious diseases. For instance, society currently grapples with the so-called tripledemic or the convergence of the flu, Covid-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
