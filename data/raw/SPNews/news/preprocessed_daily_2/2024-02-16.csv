1,c13698f5-cace-3fd8-9dd9-d8a276fbc3ea,SCHW,2024-02-16,Robinhood’s earnings surprise could be the start of something bigger,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-earnings-surprise-could-start-143410403.html,1708007650,STORY,"['HOOD', 'SCHW']","['I’ve written about a lot of public companies during my time as a tech and finance reporter, and count Robinhood as one of the most interesting of the bunch. This is partly because the company is good at product innovation, but mostly because of its compelling narrative: Robinhood believes it can transcend its roots as a platform for twentysomethings to make tiny YOLO stock bets into something more resembling mighty full-service brokerages like Fidelity and Charles Schwab.', 'At the same time, though, Robinhood has shown a habit for stepping on rakes. These include the time it had to issue billions of dollars worth of stock-diluting warrants to escape from a collateral catastrophe, and its many run-ins with regulators over its gonzo marketing and other fast-growth tricks. There was also the period when something like a quarter of Robinhood’s revenue came from slinging the novelty cryptocurrency Doge. Such episodes, along with its flailing share price, often made it seem that Robinhood was more fit to be a bolt-on acquisition for a big bank than a serious brand for the long term.', 'This has not been the case in recent months, however, as Robinhood has avoided dumb mistakes while showing that maybe it has a long-term plan after all. This was reflected in the Q4 earnings it released on Tuesday, which marked a return to profitability and the promise of significant growth in the coming years. HOOD shares were up around 20% on Wednesday as investors liked the uptick in crypto and equity transactions and a surge in interest-related revenue.', 'That money from interest—which comes mostly from customer balances and margin lending—is not quite a sugar high, nor is it a long-term path to growth. That’s because interest rates can rise, of course, but they can also fall, and will likely do so before long, cutting into Robinhood’s earnings in the process. You can check out the specifics in these company slides, which are unusually revealing for an earnings report.', 'The most interesting question to ask about the latest earnings, though, is whether the company’s narrative—that it will grow to be a Charles Schwab for the next generation—still looks achievable now that nearly three years have elapsed since Robinhood first went public. The answer is a cautious yes. Robinhood now has around $1.7 billion in retirement assets (which came about in part from an aggressive incentive program) while the average size of customer balances is growing. This fits with CEO Vlad Tenev’s longtime theory that its core customer base, who mostly arrived as impoverished YOLO types, are gaining wealth as they get older and will start using Robinhood in the same way their parents did Charles Schwab (a disrupter of its own when it came on the scene in the 1970s).', 'Robinhood also has some intangible qualities that offer the makings of long-term success. Those include the ongoing presence of Tenev, who, as is the case with other founders, has ensured his company continues to innovate. Meanwhile, for those of you who think this is all too rosy and want a reality check, here’s one: Robinhood’s total assets under management have grown by only $5 billion since 2021 and total just $103 billion. Compare that to Fidelity and Schwab, which respectively control around $11 trillion and $7 trillion. Robinhood still has a very long way to the big leagues. Nonetheless, this week’s earnings were a reminder this company still has the capacity to surprise.', 'Jeff John Robertsjeff.roberts@fortune.com@jeffjohnroberts', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Anthony Will', ""Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday afternoon, we posted financial results for the full year 2023, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.8 billion. Net cash from operations was also $2.8 billion, and free cash flow was $1.8 billion. These results reflect a healthy nitrogen supply-demand balance and global energy spreads that favor our low-cost production base in North America.They also represent outstanding execution by the CF Industries team. We work safely, ran our plants well and navigated dynamic industry conditions. Our investments in people, safety and reliability have built the industry's highest-performing manufacturing network, as you can see on Slide 6. Looking ahead, over the next 4 years, confirmed construction of new nitrogen production capacity is not sufficient to keep pace with the historical nitrogen demand growth rate of roughly 1.5% per year in traditional applications. Adding to this tight supply-demand situation is the risk that existing ammonia production capacity in several important regions remains on the verge of permanent closure due to constrained availability and cost of natural gas. Meanwhile, emerging demand for low-carbon ammonia into clean energy applications should further tighten the already strained global supply-demand balance. As a result, we are confident that our cash generation will remain strong, as underscored by the recent increase in our quarterly dividend and continued share repurchases. We look to continue to invest in high-return organic and inorganic projects to grow our cash generation. As such, we continue evaluating a new low-carbon ammonia production plant at our Blue Point Complex in Louisiana with our partner, Mitsui. Our company share a belief that North America is the best location for production of low-carbon ammonia given natural gas cost advantages and access to CCS sites and expertise. As you can see on Slide 8, the economic value of North American nitrogen assets continues to increase over time, supporting returns greater than the cost of capital and new projects. We and Mitsui are targeting a final investment decision in the second half of 2024, when we have additional information on low-carbon ammonia production technologies and better clarity on customer requirements for carbon intensity levels along with regulatory developments. While taking a disciplined approach to growth, we will continue to return capital through our dividends and share repurchases. We have approximately $2.6 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization and fully expect to complete it before its expiration at the end of 2025. With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen market conditions in more detail. Bert?"", 'Bert A. Frost', ""Thanks, Tony. The fourth quarter of 2023 was an active period for our team. Highlighted by the largest fall ammonia application season in North America in years. A strong fall application season indicates a commitment to nitrogen consuming crops on these acres and robust demand for additional urea and UAN applications through the first half of 2024. This, along with strong ag fundamentals, supports our outlook for a positive spring application season. We expect 91 million acres of corn to be planted in the United States. As we continue to work with customers in advance of spring applications, we believe supply is more constrained in the North American nitrogen channel than industry expectations. Inventories were below average entering the year and net imports of nitrogen to the region are not making up the difference. The cold snap we experienced in North America during January has exacerbated this situation. We believe that there has been significant volume of domestic nitrogen production lost due to weather-related shutdowns across the region supply base. We estimate that CF Industries lost approximately 150,000 tons of ammonia production in January from our own network due to the weather. Unexpected supply tightness often leads to follow-on logistics challenges and early spring would further strain the supply chain. We believe that our in-region production and extensive logistics and distribution capabilities will serve us well in this environment. Global grain stocks-to-use ratios have returned to normal levels after two robust growing seasons. However, we do not project a significant impact on global nitrogen demand given the imperative to feed growing populations. We expect continued supply constraints in key producing regions. Most notably, ammonia production and economics in Europe remain challenging. Global ammonia spot prices continue to align with the full cost of European ammonia production, confirming Europe as the industry's marginal producer. This continues to support elevated imports of nitrogen products into Europe compared to a decade ago. Beyond Europe, natural gas availability continues to affect ammonia and UAN production in Trinidad. And based on its actions in the fourth quarter of 2023, we believe the Chinese government will limit exports through the first half to ensure supply availability and urea price stability for the Chinese domestic market. Looking ahead, forward energy curve suggests continued favorable energy spreads between low cost in North American production and high-cost production in Europe and Asia. We believe this will support sustained margin opportunities for our low-cost manufacturing asset base. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."", 'Christopher D. Bohn', ""Thanks, Bert. For the full year 2023, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of approximately $1.5 billion or $7.80 per diluted share. EBITDA was $2.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA was approximately $2.8 billion. In the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of Incitec Pivot's Waggaman ammonia production facility. After adjustments and accounting for the value assigned to a long-term supply agreement with IPL's Dyno Nobel subsidiary, our cash purchase price was approximately $1.2 billion. The Waggaman facility has operated as expected since closing and has generated margin commensurate with our existing ammonia segment. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $550 million and for gross ammonia production to be near 10 million tons. As Bert said, we experienced unplanned weather-related outages in our network during January. During these outages, we pulled forward some planned maintenance activities. This should reduce scheduled downtime later this year, mitigating some of the production loss in January. As a result, we expect gross ammonia production for the year to be near our projection. Commissioning of our green ammonia project at Donaldsonville is underway. We are currently evaluating the purchase of renewable energy credits to pair with the start-up of the electrolyzer to enable green ammonia production and maximize the value of the 45V production tax credit. We expect that the CO2 dehydration and compression unit at Donaldsonville will be ready for start-up in 2025. This will enable low-carbon ammonia production and generate substantial 45Q tax credits. We are also making progress on other CCS opportunities with returns above our cost of capital. Turning to the potential new low-carbon ammonia plant at our Blue Point Complex in Louisiana, we completed our FEED study on a conventional steam methane reformer ammonia plant with CCS technologies. The FEED study estimates the cost of the pneumonia plant at approximately $2.5 billion, we estimate another $500 million for scalable infrastructure, such as storage tanks and loading docks. Our FEED studies focused on autothermal reforming or ATR ammonia production technology and flue gas capture are progressing well. Alongside disciplined clean energy investments, we are committed to returning capital to long-term shareholders. In 2023, we returned almost $900 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments despite being locked out of the repurchases for part of the year. We expect share repurchase activity to increase over the 2 remaining years on our current authorization. As you can see on Slide 7 and 8, on both are free cash flow yield and a precedent transaction basis, our enterprise value is significantly undervalued, supporting continued share repurchases. With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."", 'W. Anthony Will', ""Thanks, Chris. Before we move on to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF Industries for their contributions to an outstanding year. I especially want to highlight the progress our team made in the second half of the year regarding our safety performance.After a challenging start to 2023, we ended the year with a 12-month recordable incident rate of 0.36 incidents per 200,000 work hours in line with our performance in recent years and significantly better than industry averages. Our operational excellence and significant structural advantages underpin our cash generation. This enables us to invest in the business to further increase cash generation and drive increased shareholder participation in our free cash flow. In the last 3 years, we acquired the Waggaman ammonia production facility. Advanced high-return clean energy initiatives, increased our dividend by 67% and deployed $2.5 billion to repurchase more than 31 million shares which represented approximately 15% of the outstanding share count at that time. Additionally, we have strengthened our balance sheet to provide us tremendous flexibility as we are able to grow our business at the same time as return significant cash to shareholders. This approach has had a dramatic impact. As you can see on Slide 10, shareholder participation in our business has increased 80% in the last 10 years. We're excited about the opportunity ahead of us to build on this track record. In the near term, we expect industry fundamentals to remain favorable to our low-cost production network. Longer term, disciplined investments in low-carbon ammonia production can provide a robust growth platform for the company. Taken together, we expect to continue creating substantial value for long-term shareholders. With that, operator, we will now open the call to your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.', 'Adam Samuelson', 'Good morning, everyone. So Tony, I guess the first question is we think about the decision to pursue additional FEED studies on the Blue Point Complex evaluating the different technologies. Just help us frame the increment on carbon reduction that could come from either ATR or the flue gas capture? And maybe any additional color on the policy drivers of your potential offtakers as they evaluate what threshold is needed to commit to taking the blue ammonia volumes longer term?', 'W. Anthony Will', ""Yes, Adam. So one of the reasons that we're evaluating all the different kind of possible paths forward is to really have a comprehensive set of solutions depending upon the carbon intensity levels that are ultimately demanded by customers. And conventional CCS, the way that we've implemented it in Donaldsonville today allows for the process CO2 to be stripped out and sequestered, and that means you can reduce the carbon intensity by about almost 70% versus kind of conventional ammonia, particularly given the plant that we're talking about having implemented that on is among one of the most efficient newest plants in the world. So it already is a fairly low footprint relative to older plants. If you look at doing flue gas capture in conjunction with processed gas CCS we think we can get rid of in excess of 95% of the CO2 emissions coming out of that particular plant. If you look at autothermal reforming, the estimates are you can get to the 90% to 95% reduction level. But the problem with that is because of the way that the technology works, you have to have a very, very large air separation unit to introduce the nitrogen back into the process that you don't get when you're -- because you're not doing steam methane reforming. And the electricity draw on a large AirSep unit like that is a tremendous adder to cost of the project as well as op cost. And based on the grids where we're thinking about, the Scope 2 emissions become substantial. So that means you've got to do a bunch of things in order to potentially limit the emissions of Scope 2 that you'd otherwise pick up in order to get to the 90% or 95% reduction levels. And that brings with it all of its own set of costs and OpEx, CapEx. So that's really why we're looking at kind of all of these different possible paths to give us kind of the full suite of optionality and really understand OpEx, CapEx costs in order to hit certain thresholds that the customers may ultimately demand in terms of the product. But the other point is we have a very large network longer term that we are focused on getting to carbon neutrality in the next 25 years. And so flue gas capture is going to play an important role in that process as we continue to move forward. And so us kind of getting more heavily involved in that and really understanding the different potential paths is an important thing for us longer term strategically anyway. And this is a good time for us to really kind of dive in as we're contemplating making an investment decision in new production."", 'Adam Samuelson', ""All right. That's all very helpful. And if I could just squeeze a quick market question just on natural gas. As you think about the decline recently in TTF and LNG prices broadly, it doesn't seem like you expect quick restart of idled or high-cost European production? Just how are you thinking about that over the course of the year?"", 'Bert A. Frost', ""Yes, Adam, this is Bert. When you look at the spreads, what's going on in the world with Henry Hub trading today at $1.60, $1.65 and NBP and TTF in Europe, trading in the, let's say, $7 to $8 range and so you have a pretty big spread. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, where we are in the ammonia supply chain, you're bidding close to that full cost range for European and some high-cost Asian producers especially when you consider carbon costs. And so the competitiveness, we're still in our position of the European producer is the marginal producer, and that will set the cost floor or the price floor. And we don't see in the short term an improvement in gas supply taking place to lower that value."", 'Christopher D. Bohn', ""Yes. And I would just add to that, that the decision goes beyond just the cash cost immediately goes into the idea of cycling these plants is not necessarily good, additional maintenance that may be needed prior to starting those back up or turnarounds that are coming forward or even holding inventory at certain periods of time that have a working capital cost to them. So I think gas is obviously the primary driver, but there's a lot of other ancillary drivers that go into factor and whether you restart."", 'W. Anthony Will', ""Overall, I think, though, the message you're hearing from us is we're very -- we're very optimistic about what the S&D balance looks like and what the demand for our products are on a global basis. It gives Bert a lot of optionality to think about exports and satisfying in-market demand here. And we just have a lot of roads to help get us there."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Joel Jackson', ""A couple of questions. I noticed in your slide deck, your new updated sensitivity table, right, that shows EBITDA for every level of gas price and urea price, it's down in every single cell by $300 million at the same gas price and the same U.S. gas price in the same urea price versus what you had in the fall. Can you explain what's going -- and it's that higher volume now? You're I think 1 million tons higher volume. Can you explain the drop in EBITDA at every single cell?"", 'W. Anthony Will', ""Yes. Let's start off with the volume issue first because I think that's an important one to kind of get on the table, and then we'll go through kind of the table in a little more detail. But although we did add the Waggaman facility into the network, there is a maintenance turnaround event on that facility, and there's also a couple of significant maintenance activities. One of them is on table number 6, which is our -- the largest operating ammonia plant in the world. And so when you've got a 40-day outage on a plant like that, that takes our production down. Now that said, as Chris and Bert talked about, we still expect to generate about circa 10 million tons of ammonia this year, which is in line with what we've historically done. The big issue in terms of last year versus this year was we had -- we entered into last year with a fairly high inventory level. So we had pretty substantial additional sales volumes last year based on inventory drawdown that we're not able to tap into. So our volumes kind of year-on-year are going to be order of magnitude fairly similar last year to this year."", 'Christopher D. Bohn', 'Yes. And additionally, Joel, I think the big -- one of the bigger aspects of it is the relationship between the products on a pricing basis was updated to what 2023 was. So we always use the prior year as sort of the structure benchmark from that compared to 2022. So you saw more parity between the products than maybe what was a premium for UAN prior to that. And obviously, we do quite a bit of UAN volume. So this is just based on not only the cost structure of 2023, which we saw higher non-gas costs, primarily through logistics but then also that new relationship that we experienced over the last 12 months on pricing.', 'Joel Jackson', ""Okay. So my follow-up will be kind of 2-parter because first, I just want to follow up on that. So I guess you're saying at the same gas price and same urea price, excuse me, UAN and ammonia prices are lower at the same urea and gas price? And then my true follow-up question would be, when looking at the blue, the greenfield blue project, blue ammonia Project. Obviously, we saw a very good valuation comp with coke and the weaver plant a couple of months ago that you obviously didn't buy, would it not make sense for you to just buy back stock as much as you can, just attack at authorization, don't do any greenfield plants because the market's not giving you the valuation, and the coke is obviously giving to Weaver. I know it's not exactly 1-to-1, but isn't just makes sense just buy back stock as much as you can?"", 'W. Anthony Will', ""Yes. Let me take the first one first, and then I'll come back to your second point. The first one, not really being a full-on question, more of a statement. So every year, we try to update the table based on what the relationship was in terms of margin per nutrient ton of the previous year. And so the table will naturally evolve up and down and sideways and whatnot based on previous year. It doesn't mean that this is precise because if UAN starts on a -- nutrient basis starts trading at a premium to urea then the numbers are going to go up in every cell because of the volume of UAN that we sell. So this is illustrative as opposed to a point estimate. But your general comment of the relative premium of UAN versus urea dropped last year compared to where it was the year before is the right kind of takeaway, and that's the basis and underlying the sensitivity table. On the second question, we think that the price paid for Weaver is a fair but a full price for that asset. And our view is that at any point in time where we have made decisions to expand our network. Someone could have made exactly the same argument that you just made, which is it's cheaper to buy back shares than it is to add capacity. Therefore, you should never add back or add capacity. That would have been true. Back in 2010 when we bought Terra that would have been true. When we acquired the Medicine Hat slice that we didn't know and that would have been true. When we did the expansion projects at Donaldsonville and Port Neal or even probably the Waggaman asset that was just acquired. At every stage, we have been able to invest capital and earn a rate of return well above our cost of capital. So that's a value-adding transaction, whereas buying shares back at market price by definition, is sort of NPV 0. Our view is if you look at the aggregate amount of cash that we generate and shareholder participation, sort of the ratio of the number of shares outstanding. Our shareholders have been much better off based on the combined approach that we've taken to both disciplined add capacity and also take shares out of the marketplace. And that has created a lot of value relative to an exclusive pathway of one versus the other. And so we're going to continue to evaluate the attractiveness of adding capacity on a basis of can we generate returns on a risk-adjusted basis above our cost of capital because generating more cash flow simply allows larger share repurchases in the future and it's not necessarily a point in time comparison about where we're trading in that moment because as you well know, these assets go 40, 50, 60 years in length. And so we really need to take a view of do we fully expect it to be a positive IRR and PP positive transaction to invest in a new plant because we can always default to buying shares back. And by the way, because of how well the business is operating, it's not an either/or question for us, we can actually do both at the same time."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.', 'Stephen V. Byrne', ""Bert, I got a couple of questions about your near-term outlook. Could the strong ammonia fall application season, you wrote the spring demand for urea perhaps more than UAN. Is that why maybe your UAN production was so robust in the fourth quarter. .And when you look out at imports coming into the U.S., you commented about low inventory levels, some lower production in the U.S., we're hearing that there might be a much less level of imports this spring than in prior years. Is that consistent with your view? And how much have you sold forward into the second quarter?"", 'Bert A. Frost', ""Okay, Steve. And some very good questions and top of the -- of our mind today. Because as we look outside in Sunny Chicago, it's 43 degrees and we've got good soil moisture, and I would anticipate an early spring based on historicals and what we see throughout the Midwest. What that means is you're pulling forward demand. That encompassing earlier opening to river barges means product can move. So a lot of synergistic things happening at the same time. Our outlook is positive. 91 million acres of corn and good moisture and wheat country and as well as good value surpassed. You're going to see nitrogen applications in all the segments, probably at or above normal. When you look at the fall ammonia level. As we said, that was our -- probably our second best fall ammonia in 10 years. But when you put that into context of how many tons could go out, there is a substantial amount of demand to be satisfied with ammonia, UAN and urea in the spring. So our probably a couple of hundred thousand tons more than normal, we believe we were one of the last companies standing due to our logistics capabilities and distribution networks, which we leveraged very well with product in place, and then we're able to run all the way through November in Q4. And so I look for a very positive spring demand for UAN and urea as well as ammonia. The imports have been lower, and that's been fairly consistent. But when you go back and look at it in totality, the low level of inventory we believe that we carried in, coupled with the low level of imports to date, and we're tracking vessel nominations in what we think are coming in, in Feb, March and April, it's going to be a challenge. And then, again, weaving into that an early spring impacts that even more. And so our forward call is we're probably going to see and we are seeing some price appreciation, you're going to see demand coming forward earlier, and we're prepared or being prepared for that eventuality even with some of the loss of production we experienced in January, we believe others in our industry experience it as well. But these are the challenges we face, and we will meet them."", 'Stephen V. Byrne', ""And maybe just one quick one for you, Chris. In that flue gas carbon capture analysis that you're doing there's a variety of technologies out there. Are you looking at several different technologies? And are you also looking at potentially using oxygen in the boiler instead of urea?"", 'Christopher D. Bohn', ""Well, I'll say the engineering team has reviewed several different engineering types for the flue gas capture, but we are focusing on one specific as we're moving through the FEED study rather than doing multiple FEED studies with additional technology providers through that."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Josh Spector with UBS.', 'Joshua David Spector', ""So I wanted to follow up on the additional FEED studies for carbon capture. And just specifically asked about if there's been any changes in what you're hearing in terms of policy in Japan. I thought Japan was kind of leading the way that clean ammonia 60%, 70% lower carbon was something they were comfortable with accepting with their first move to reduce coal intensity, maybe other countries wanted to push it further. Does has anything changed on the Japan side and as that relates to your first potential investment here?"", 'Christopher D. Bohn', ""Yes. From Japan side, I don't think they've come out necessarily with the strict, what are their requirements for carbon intensity. We've had plenty of discussions not only with our partners, but with the government related to that, there's a few different scenarios that they're playing through. But as to exactly what they want, that hasn't come. They have, as you mentioned, preliminarily said that they would be willing to accept a lower carbon intensity or I should say, yes, a lower carbon intensity amount there, whereas some of the other nations specifically Korea, are looking for carbon intensity that basically has 90% reduction. And that's why we're looking at some of these other options as well to do that. So more to come on the clarity, as Tony mentioned in his prepared remarks and his questions about what's happening out at Japan. Now, one of the things that is occurring in Japan right now is the cabinet has moved forward with a package for this towards the diet. So we should see some sort of approval from essentially the diet in the next several months. And then from there, Medi would be able to allocate those funds and we begin to put in applications for the projects with our partners. So nothing has changed from where we stood 3 months ago or 6 months ago, but we are looking at many different alternatives, as Tony mentioned."", 'Joshua David Spector', ""Okay. So just on Waggaman. I mean I don't believe you mentioned at all that -- anything update on what you're doing in terms of potential CCS at that site. So just curious if you have any thoughts there on what that could look like time line wise? And if there's anything to note about why CapEx or even OpEx, I guess, as you think about sending it on pipeline to get sequestered if that's meaningfully different versus what you're doing in Donaldsonville or similar?"", 'Christopher D. Bohn', ""Well, I think Waggaman is just another site within our whole entire network now. So we're viewing Waggaman similarly how we're reviewing all our sites when it comes to CCS, that being specifically Yazoo City, and Medicine Hat in Alberta, some of the projects that are a little bit further along but our team is evaluating CCS at Waggaman, but again, similar to how we're evaluating at all other sites. What I would say from a pipeline and sequestration, I think with Louisiana getting primacy on Class VI, we should be seeing a little bit more expedited approvals of those Class VI, specifically in Louisiana and that's going to help move things along much more quickly. And I think based on some of where those Class VI wells, particularly are, are also going to direct us where we're going to put more of our time on each of our network sites for CCS. So more to come on that, but we continue to evaluate and be very optimistic about Waggaman just as we are at Donaldsonville today."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.', 'Jeffrey John Zekauskas', 'Who are the natural buyers for your green ammonia? And how do you think about the price at which you might sell it?', 'Bert A. Frost', ""So what we're working on now is just that the volume of product that we will be producing could be digestible in a vessel, which could go to Europe. We're working with some of the ethanol producers for a low-carbon corn value chain, which we believe will lead then to sustainable aviation fuel and low carbon fuel products. We're talking to some of the food companies and some of their labeling ventures and how do we do that and incorporate that? So both blue and green or let's just call it low carbon and no carbon products, we're moving forward. And we think we have quite a few opportunities to market those products at a value over conventional products."", 'Christopher D. Bohn', ""Yes. And I think if you look at it, Jeff, both similar with blue and green, we're going to be the first to market with these. And as you look at the green, there's just not a lot of supply there. So as Bert mentioned, you're probably going to see a premium based on that product that is significantly above our cost, I would say, just because it's a smaller amount. As we bring on blue, we'll be the first in the world with any measurable amount of volume with that. And I think there's a lot of activity, as Bert said, on the demand pull side that we're beginning to see that we feel fairly confident that we'll be able to receive some sort of premium on it what that is, that is yet to be determined 100% at this time."", 'Jeffrey John Zekauskas', 'Okay. And then natural gas prices have fallen pretty sharply, but you also hedge. Do you expect much hedging penalty in the first quarter?', 'Bert A. Frost', ""So how we talk about gas is just that. We do hedge and we saw that the reason why in January with the spikes up to $50 in our Iowa facilities and actual availability or lack thereof in some other facilities. So hedging and securing supply during the cold months of Dec, Jan and Feb are important. But you're correct on the reverse side of that is those hedges were taken at higher value than we are in the cash market today. So your first quarter value for gas will be over what the cash value is and more to come on that."", 'W. Anthony Will', ""I would say, though, the offset to that, Jeff, is we're not -- we're clearly not 100% hedged. We do, to Bert's point, like to do basis hedging more than Henry Hub necessarily hedging. And so we are benefiting from the drop in the daily cash rate on a piece of it as well. And so in some cases, it's not fixed price. There could be some swaps or some colors that are in there. And so we do get to participate in a portion of that reduction in gas costs. But really, what we're trying to do is protect the margin against unusual weather events that can blow out against us. And if you end up giving up a nickel or a dime along the way in order to protect against the potential blowout that's a reasonable insurance policy from our perspective. But Q2 forward is open."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Richard Garchitorena with Wells Fargo.', 'Richard Garchitorena', 'My first question was just on the update to the Mitsui JV and the clean energy project. So it looks like the initial CapEx estimate from the FEED study is roughly $3 billion. Just curious, where did -- does that compare to the original estimate when you signed the MOU back in early 2022, how much capacity does that entail and then also, what protocols are you putting in place to maintain that cost estimate as you progress through development?', 'W. Anthony Will', 'Yes. So we have not made a final investment decision on that yet. We have an estimate that we think is within kind of plus/minus 10%-ish of the final cost. But we have not made a decision to proceed with that. And therefore, there\'s nothing that we\'ve done to kind of ""lock"" in that price because no decision has been made to progress. Relative to when we initially began talking with Mitsui and created kind of the MOU around the joint venture to pursue this project. We had, I would say, some very high-level estimates of where we thought the cost might come in, but we certainly had not gone through the process of doing the FEED study to get an accurate cost estimate. And so it was just directional at best. I would say that the cost to complete, including the site level and a scalable infrastructure that Chris mentioned in his comments, is a bit higher than what we had maybe initially thought. But I think that\'s reflective of the relatively tight labor market and inflation in general, particularly around some of the exotic metals that are required. But what that also suggests is that the value of existing assets is that much higher as we saw with the sale of the Weaver asset here just recently and suggest that the value of the rest of our network is, again, even that much higher as well. So we\'re still in process of evaluating whether there\'s a project that we want to fund here or not. And as part of that, we are evaluating different production technologies and different amounts of carbon reduction levels. And we\'ll make that ultimate decision kind of sometime in the back half of this year, along with our partner, Mitsui.', 'Richard Garchitorena', ""Okay. Great. And then just talking about the nitrogen market. It looks like you cited about 40% of ammonia capacity in Europe being shut down in early January. And that's up versus around 25%, I believe, as of early November. And this is during a period when European natural gas prices have actually come down over 40%. So I guess, what is driving that? Is that -- is part of that curtailment maintenance shutdowns? Or are these -- part of these permanent shutdowns they expect to continue through 2024?"", 'W. Anthony Will', ""I mean I think it can be both of that. There's also an issue of if you can acquire deepwater-traded ammonia at a cost that's lower than what you can produce using domestic gas. There's no reason not to do it. If you are in a facility primarily doing nitrate as opposed to urea, you don't need the CO2."", 'Bert A. Frost', ""And I think a reflection of the gas -- current gas price today is in the cash market that was not available just a short time ago. And so the reflection of 40% as a look back on Q4 and entering into Q1, and you're probably going to see some of those plants restart, especially with the Russian announcement of limiting ammonium nitrate exports that just came out today, that's going to have a substantial impact on Eastern Europe and Central Europe and probably the ability to export for the Western European producers who can export, for example, Brazil had a 1 million-ton consumer of ammonium nitrate and Central America will need someone to supply that. So let's say, today, it's $8 gas, that's doable in relation to the absence of the product coming out of Russia. So things are changing. And I think the gas as well as the supply market is as well."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Edlain Rodriguez with Mizuho.', 'Edlain S. Rodriguez', ""Maybe this is for Tony, or maybe for Bert. I mean if you compare where we are today with 3, 4, 5 months ago, are you more positive or less positive on the prospect of the industry in CF for 2024, and that's looking at some of the big drivers, like corn prices, corn acreage, the energy complex, supply demand? Like anything else you want to address? Like do you see things being more -- are you more or less positive?"", 'W. Anthony Will', ""Yes. I mean, I think gas has been very constructive for us. Our cost, it looks like as they're shaping up for the balance of the year should be down substantially relative to where we were back in kind of November when we put together our thoughts of where we expected the year to come out. I also think that some of the other changes kind of structurally, whether it's potential imports running slower than expected in early spring what we believe is lower channel inventories than kind of many expect out there. All of those things, I think, are net positives for our business, particularly for the first half. So overall, my sense is we're feeling pretty good about the way the year is shaping up."", 'Bert A. Frost', ""I agree. In terms of where we were coming into a falling market, falling urea price market in Q4 and now in Q1 arising urea market. Why is that? Related to energy, of course, and the inability of -- or the non-economic position of the European producer and higher imports, but you're seeing in terms of the global market of a very tight market, you've had downtime in Malaysia, export restrictions in Indonesia, export restrictions in China, as well as heavy imports and continued imports into India, but heavy imports into Brazil. And we're just entering our season, as we talked about previously with a tight market and needing to be -- to bring in product and so you have a tighter global market and then that's reflected in price. For the values for the FEED grains, corn at $64.70 is very attractive, especially when you look at trend yield over 180 and yields in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana above 200, it's very profitable. This will be the fourth best year in 10 years for the American farmer. And so when you couple that all together, as well as global supply and demand, I would say we're positive for 2023 -- 2024."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Ben Theurer with Barclays.', 'Benjamin M. Theurer', ""Just wanted to follow up a little bit on the international trade dynamics and in particular, the export market versus the import markets and where you're seeing especially in South America, Brazil inventory levels. We've talked about the North American as being low, but we all know Brazil has been a little bit more of an issue. So within that 70 million to 80 million tons of import need. What's your sense on the ground inventories in Brazil right now? And how does that shape up for your opportunities to potentially export into the region?"", 'Bert A. Frost', ""Yes. So CF is an active exporter of our major products, ammonia, UAN, urea and some ammonium nitrate. The UAN has predominantly gone to Europe, Argentina and Australia and urea is more spot and situational. Where we are in Brazil today with about 44 million tons of consumption of NPK and the targets for 2024 are closer to 46 million tons, you're going to need -- our projections are over 8 million tons of urea imports to Brazil for the calendar year. And that's a very positive move. That will push Brazil to the largest importing country surpassing India who is between 6 million and 7 million tons now. Brazil did have high levels of inventories and imports entering the year. Much of that was consumed during the safrinha season of which is January, February and March of applications, and they are low-level importers 200,000, 300,000 tons a month. Their wheat application starts in April, and then we moved to corn applications in July, August, September and then cotton later in the year and again, repeating the cycle. So Brazil is the positive, I'd say, consumption train in the world of fertilizer economies, and it's going to continue to play a major part and so the S&D right now is balanced globally for urea."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Andrew D. Wong', ""So regarding your hurdle rate that's required for the investment decision at Blue Point, if you say -- like if you get take-or-pay offtake with steady volumes and steady margins, does that lower the rate for the hurdle versus some of your other projects or buybacks or anything else you'd be considering?"", 'Christopher D. Bohn', ""Yes. I think as you look at any return on a project, it's a set return with a risk premium based in there. If you have take-or-pay, that's offtake on a ratable basis, you're probably willing to take a lower return profile on that. I mean that allows a lot of additional synergies that run throughout the entire network as we see with our Mosaic contract with them taking ammonia on a ratable basis, lower inventory, lower receivables, different things like that, lower risk involved and therefore, that allows you to have a lower risk premium and therefore, taking a slightly lower return on that."", 'Andrew D. Wong', 'Okay. Great. And then just regarding the Donaldsonville blue ammonia project, could you just provide the latest update for the injection well permits? And I think you mentioned this Louisiana gaining primacy on the classic wells. What does that mean? And how quickly can you get approvals there? And how quickly can drilling be completed?', 'Christopher D. Bohn', ""Yes. So the approval time line on that is really based on our partner, Exxon, and what they're doing both with the Class VI and some of that's probably been accelerated some by their acquisition of the Denbury pipeline because it allows them other access to different states with Class VI that may have a, I would say, a shorter queue time than what Louisiana or some of the other states, so we are confident that in 2025, we will economically be receiving a benefit related to the 45Q and therefore, we'll have low carbon ammonia ready."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.', 'Vincent Stephen Andrews', ""Tony, on the blue ammonia JV with Mitsui, I guess a couple of questions. One, if we get to the second half of '24, and I assume that's probably the third quarter call or maybe you'll have an update and you're not moving forward at that point, what happened, do you think? And then just secondly, I believe there are several other potential MOUs or JV partners that you have out there. Is there any update on those? Or is that all pending sort of the outcome with Mitsui?"", 'W. Anthony Will', ""Yes. We're very happy with the agreements that we have in place and the partners that we have lined up to pursue these kind of opportunities with us. A lot of them that we have come out publicly with tend to be Asian focus. So a couple of Japanese firms as well as South Koreans. I would say that the Korean government and the customers as a result are a little bit behind from a time line perspective compared to the Japanese. And so we'll likely be making a decision around a plant principally targeting the Japanese market first, and then we'll eventually look at both Korean market and potentially European partners that we've discussed with as well further out. And that could be served by one in the same plant or it might have different requirements associated with it. But if we decide not to proceed, I think it's a combination of very likely just aggregate costs associated with moving forward and lack of line of sight on making sure that we can earn an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return against that cost or not. Relative to the global S&D. I think I kind of went through that a bit in my prepared remarks, which is we're constructive on where we sit right now. Our results last year were strong. We're looking at another good year this year. Longer term, traditional applications for nitrogen continue to grow in the kind of 1.5 plus or minus percent range per year, and there's not enough new projects that are currently under construction globally to meet that requirement. Adding into the either supply deficit or demand increase is you've got some plants around the world, including Trinidad and some in Europe that are facing challenges with gas availability and gas cost. And then you've got new or potentially new applications for ammonia that are also developing. So all of those things lead to a tighter global S&D marketplace bidding in higher and higher cost of production around the world. And that provides, I think, a reasonable backdrop for us to be considering building new production capacity. But we have to, at the end of the day, be comfortable that we can earn an appropriate rate of return that's well above our cost of capital for us to want to proceed with a project like that."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Aron Ceccarelli with Berenberg.', 'Aron Ceccarelli', ""My first one is about the comments you made on farmer incomes in your press release. You talked about improving farmer income in North America and in 2024. I was wondering what's the thought process here, considering that we saw John Deere today being a little bit more downbeat and I think USDA report last month was a little bit downbeat to. My second question is around blue ammonia and the news around the potential partnership with POSCO. Is there any color you can provide about the implied blue premium you are assuming or you have in mind? And my final one is on exports from China. I think Yara last week in Europe mentioned that Chinese export could potentially come back a little bit, your messaging today in the presentation seems that there could be some temporary windows about where Chinese could export. So just wondering if you see the situation changing pretty much what you would expect, again, a very tight export market from China at this stage?"", 'Bert A. Frost', ""Regarding the farmer income comment, what my comment was it's the fourth best in about 10 years. So when you look at -- as compared to last year, the year before, you're referencing John Deere, some of the chemical or seed suppliers, if not it's lower, but it's still at $4, $64.70 corn for December, corn pricing today, and what was hedgeable not just a few months ago with $5.10, $5.20 very attractive, again, based on just trend yield of 180 bushels an acre, which is what we're targeting for 2024. But most high-state farmers are in the 200 to 250 bushels. So very profitable even with the drop in fertilizer prices, the drop in diesel prices. And so you have to look at the total cost structure for a farmer, whether that's owned land or rented land, variable costs against fixed costs and putting that whole structure together, it's still a good time to be a farmer. That was the point. Regarding the exports from China, we've seen a different China about every other year. And our prepared remarks and communication about what we expect out of China is that the government restrictions are in place for urea and some phosphate products. They will continue through or into Q2 and our expectations for China -- or if they will export, they will return to the export market. And being that in the past 5 years, it's been between 2 million and 5 million tons we would say 3 million to 4 million tons of exports or a logical volume for 2024."", 'W. Anthony Will', ""And then relative to blue ammonia premium, blue ammonia for us makes great economic sense even if there were no premium in the marketplace because of the 45Q tax credit, I think we've kind of gone through that math a little bit in the past, but we expect a net benefit from the Donaldsonville blue ammonia project in order of magnitude of roughly about $100 million net benefit to us per year. So just on the face of it, that's a great investment for us. Now that said, we have had I would say, ever-increasing interest levels in blue ammonia from a variety of different constituents, including a number of our existing customers, but also some other folks that have reached out. And so based on a relatively small volume of decarbonized or blue ammonia that's going to be available principally just from us beginning in 2025. And the appetite in the marketplace, we absolutely believe that it's going to be a commodity and scarce supply relative to the appetite for it. And so it will carry with it a premium in the marketplace just on in S&D, there's more demand than there is supply on. We have not formalized exactly how we're thinking about selling that in because we want to begin actually producing it, and that's going to be dependent to some extent on the timing of our partner Exxon Mobil in this deal. But we feel very good about the likelihood of a reasonable premium that adds on to what's a very attractive regulatory framework for blue."", 'Bert A. Frost', ""Also, I have one more positive comment for the team, for the company and for what we are about as a company with the Do It Right culture, we have the highest onstream factor. We have the best safety statistics in the world. And we're going to lead the world in this move to low-carbon ammonia because it's the right thing to do and the government is incentivizing us and our shareholders want us to do this. And so there's a lot of positive energy going forward with that and what we will bring to the market."", 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today.

As consumers pull back from certain luxuries, will other parts of the retail sector be hit with pullbacks as well?', 'Anthony Chukumba, Loop Capital Markets Managing Director, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the changing habits of the consumer and where the consumer will continue to spend, and what investors should keep an eye on.', 'When asked where consumers can still feel like they\'re getting the best value for their dollar, Chukumba replies: ""The low price leaders continue to be Walmart (WMT) on the brick and mortar side and Amazon (AMZN) on the e-commerce side. Having said that, a lot of the companies that I cover, they have kept their prices very, very competitive. So for example, you mentioned Dollar Tree (DLTR). Dollar Tree owns Family Dollar and there\'s Dollar General (DG) as well, and what we have found is that Family Dollar and Dollar General prices, they\'re not quite at price parity with Walmart, but they\'re usually sort of a low single-digit to mid-single-digit percentage higher than Walmart, and that\'s all they kind of need to be because it is a different purchase occasion.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", '- And we know that consumers have been pulling back on those big ticket items. But what about some of these, some of these cheaper brands. If you like a Five Below, or Dollar Tree here, are we still seeing some pullback there as well?', ""ANTHONY CHUKUMBA: So I mean, given the fact that the consumer, even though the macroeconomic indicators and variables are fairly strong, the consumer still has this almost like ongoing dread, and I think part of that is just the fact that even though inflation is coming down we did have a couple of years of elevated inflation rates. And so they're still looking to stretch their dollar."", 'And yeah, and one way that they can do that is going to a Five Below, is going to Dollar Tree. And so we are seeing that trade down from higher priced retailers to those what we refer to as deep discounters. And we expect that to continue certainly early in 2024.', ""- One of the things that's awesome about the work that you and your team at Loop do, is you do your own price comps as well at discount stores. Where, for consumers out there that are trying to figure out, just where is the best place to buy? Where am I actually getting the best deal from a retailer? What have you seen in market, in channel checks."", ""ANTHONY CHUKUMBA: Yeah. So I mean, generally the low priced leaders continue to be Walmart, on the brick and mortar side, and Amazon on the e-commerce side. Now, having said that, a lot of the companies that I cover, they have kept their prices very, very competitive. So for example, you mentioned Dollar Tree. Dollar Tree owns Family Dollar, and then there's Dollar General as well."", ""And what we have found is that Family Dollar and Dollar General prices, they're not quite at price parity with Walmart, but they're usually a low single digit, to a mid-single digit percentage higher than Walmart. And that's all they really that they need to be, quite frankly, because it is a different purchase occasion, it's a mid-week shopping trip. So a person is just not going to trudge all the way out to Walmart to save a low to mid single digit percentage, particularly on $15 basket size."", ""Amazon, like I said, is the, is the leader in terms of online. But going back to Best Buy, what we have found is that Best Buy is usually within 1% or 2% of Amazon. And Best Buy also will price match Amazon. So price transparency is as high as it's ever been, right? Everyone has a smartphone, it's really easy to compare prices. You don't have to drive from store to store to do that. So it is incumbent on retailers to make sure that even if they're not the low price leader, they are at least price competitive within spitting distance of the low price leader.""]"

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with EQR.', ""On February 15, 2024, Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) filed its 10-K report, revealing a comprehensive overview of the company's financial health and strategic direction. Equity Residential, a leading apartment real estate investment trust (REIT), owns a portfolio of 304 apartment communities with approximately 80,000 units and is actively developing additional properties. The company's focus on owning high-quality properties in strategic urban and suburban submarkets across key cities has positioned it for sustained growth. Despite broader economic concerns, Equity Residential's financial tables indicate a robust demand for its apartment communities, underpinned by high single-family home ownership costs and positive household formation trends. The company's commitment to sustainability, diversity, and inclusion further strengthens its market position, aligning with evolving stakeholder values."", ""Market Position and Quality Portfolio: Equity Residential boasts a strong market presence, owning large, high-quality properties in urban and suburban submarkets of major cities. This strategic positioning allows the company to capitalize on the high costs of single-family home ownership and the strong demand for multifamily housing. The company's focus on affluent renters in high-earning sectors reduces the risk during economic downturns and enables more robust rent growth in favorable conditions."", ""Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility: Equity Residential's commitment to sustainability and corporate responsibility is a significant strength. The company's sustainability program aims to manage environmental impacts and climate-related risks through optimized capital investments and technologies. Initiatives like issuing green bonds and setting science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions underscore the company's dedication to environmental stewardship and may enhance its appeal to socially conscious investors and tenants."", ""Geographic Concentration: While the company's focus on established coastal markets is a strength, it also presents a weakness due to the potential for localized economic or regulatory impacts. If adverse conditions arise in these concentrated markets, the effect on Equity Residential's operations could be more pronounced than if the portfolio were more geographically diverse."", 'Competition and Technological Advancements: Equity Residential faces stiff competition from other housing options, which could affect its ability to attract and retain residents. Additionally, the need to keep up with technological advancements and resident demands for modern amenities requires ongoing investment, posing a challenge to maintaining competitive edge and operational efficiency.', 'Expansion into New Markets: Equity Residential has the opportunity to expand its portfolio into new markets, potentially reducing the risks associated with geographic concentration. By strategically targeting markets with favorable multifamily property conditions, the company can diversify its holdings and tap into new sources of demand.', ""Demographic Trends and Housing Demand: Positive household formation trends, particularly among younger generations, present an opportunity for Equity Residential to cater to the needs of these demographic segments. The company's focus on locations with convenient access to transportation, employment, and amenities aligns well with the preferences of Millennials and Generation Z, who are more likely to rent."", ""Economic Uncertainties and Market Volatility: Economic downturns and market volatility can adversely affect the real estate industry, impacting rental income and property values. Equity Residential's short-term lease structure exposes it to the effects of declining market rents more quickly, potentially making its results of operations and cash flows more volatile."", 'Regulatory Risks: The company operates in markets that may be subject to rent control or other regulatory changes, which could limit its ability to increase rents and affect profitability. Additionally, increased focus on corporate responsibility and sustainability could impose additional costs and expose Equity Residential to new risks if it fails to meet evolving standards.', 'In conclusion, Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) demonstrates a robust strategic position with its high-quality portfolio and focus on dynamic urban markets. Its commitment to sustainability and corporate responsibility further enhances its appeal. However, the company must navigate the challenges of geographic concentration, competition, and regulatory risks. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, Equity Residential can capitalize on market opportunities and mitigate potential threats, positioning itself for continued success in the multifamily real estate sector.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The financial tables within the filing reveal a company that is not only expanding its reach but also enhancing its offerings to meet the evolving needs of its clients in a dynamic technological landscape."", ""The following SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as presented in Gartner Inc's recent 10-K filing, providing investors and stakeholders with a nuanced understanding of the company's competitive position and future prospects."", ""Market-Leading Research and Advisory Services: Gartner Inc's strength lies in its high-quality, independent research that informs the technology decisions of business leaders worldwide. The company's research is recognized for its objectivity and depth, covering a vast array of IT-related topics. In 2023, Gartner's research experts engaged in over 490,000 direct client interactions, demonstrating the company's commitment to understanding and addressing the needs of its clients. This extensive engagement has solidified Gartner's reputation as a trusted advisor in the IT advisory market."", ""Global Presence and Established Customer Base: With a client base in approximately 90 countries, Gartner's global reach is a significant asset. The company's international footprint not only diversifies its revenue streams but also enhances its ability to gather insights from a wide range of markets and industries. This global perspective is invaluable in providing comprehensive and culturally aware advice to its clients."", ""Dependence on Non-Recurring Consulting Engagements: Gartner's Consulting segment, which accounts for approximately 9% of its total revenue, is largely project-based and non-recurring. This reliance on non-recurring engagements could lead to revenue volatility and may impact the company's financial stability. The challenge of consistently securing new engagements in a competitive market is a weakness that Gartner needs to address strategically."", 'Intense Competition for Talent: The success of Gartner Inc hinges on its ability to attract and retain top talent in a highly competitive market. As the demand for skilled professionals in technology, market research, and consulting grows, Gartner faces the risk of talent shortages and wage inflation, which could affect its profit margins and ability to deliver high-quality services.', ""Digital Transformation and IT Investment Optimization: As enterprises continue to navigate digital transformation, Gartner's expertise in IT strategy and investment optimization presents significant opportunities for growth.

By leveraging its established reputation and adapting its offerings to local needs, Gartner can capture additional market share and create new revenue streams in emerging economies."", ""Rapid Technological Changes: The fast-paced nature of technological innovation poses a threat to Gartner's ability to maintain relevance. Disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning require Gartner to continuously adapt its research and service offerings to stay ahead of the curve. Failure to do so could result in a loss of competitive edge and client trust."", ""Global Economic and Political Instabilities: Gartner's global operations expose it to risks associated with economic downturns, geopolitical tensions, and other macroeconomic factors. Such instabilities can affect client spending on IT and advisory services, potentially leading to reduced demand for Gartner's offerings."", 'In conclusion, Gartner Inc (NYSE:IT) stands as a formidable player in the IT advisory market, backed by its comprehensive research, global reach, and established customer base. However, the company must navigate the challenges of non-recurring consulting engagements, competition for talent, rapid technological advancements, and global uncertainties. By leveraging its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats, Gartner is well-positioned to continue its trajectory of informed guidance and growth in the ever-evolving world of technology.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Although lower demand normally contributes to easing pump prices, higher oil prices counteracted that pressure and ushered in the higher cost of gas, according to AAA.', 'The national average is now more expensive than a year ago for the first time since December, putting hopes of a $3 average well out of reach. Gas prices had been declining between September 2023 and January of this year to a one-year low of $3.07 before snapping that streak.

This milestone came after briefly touching the 5,000 level the previous day, marking a historic moment for the index. As a matter of fact, last week was the fifth consecutive week of gains and the 14th positive week out of the previous 15.The U.S. economy's fundamentals remain strong, as reported by the Department of Commerce, with fourth-quarter 2023 growth reaching 3.3%, surpassing the consensus estimate of 2%. Overall, U.S. GDP grew 2.5% in 2023 compared to 1.9% in 2022, exceeding the initial estimate of 2% for the year.Positive indicators such as solid nonfarm payrolls in January, robust consumer spending in December and an improving manufacturing index in January have alleviated concerns about an imminent recession among investors. Additionally, consumer confidence experienced a significant increase in January.In light of this favorable scenario, astute investors are concentrating on relative price performance, strategically identifying and capitalizing on promising opportunities that offer the potential for accelerated returns."", 'Investors generally gauge a stock’s potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it’s essential to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or an appropriate benchmark.\xa0If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance of providing considerable returns.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies.

And welcome to the Moody's Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded, and that all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, we will open the conference up for question and answers following the presentation. I will now turn the call over to Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead."", ""Shivani Kak: Thank you. And good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. This morning, Moody's released its results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, as well as our outlook for full year 2024. The earnings press release and a presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our Web site at ir.moodys.com. During this call, we will also be presenting non-GAAP or adjusted figures.

These, together with the safe harbor statements, set forth important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements. I would also like to point out that members of the media may be on the call this morning in a listen-only mode."", 'I will now turn the call over to Rob.', ""Rob Fauber: Thanks, Shivani. Good morning. And thanks to everybody for joining today's call. We're here from a snowy New York City. I'm going to start with some highlights from 2023 and then discuss our expectations for 2024. And after my prepared remarks, Steve Talinko, who is the President of Moody's Analytics; and Mike West, the President of Moody's Investor Service, will be joining me along with Caroline Sullivan, our Interim CFO for the Q&A portion of the call. And before we get into it, I have some very exciting news. As you may have seen this morning, we announced the appointment of Noemie Heuland as our new Chief Financial Officer, and she's reporting directly to me. And Noemie brings a wealth of knowledge to Moody's after nearly 25 years in senior roles at global public companies, including most recently as CFO of Dayforce, formerly Ceridian, and over a decade with global enterprise application software provider SAP, during which it transitioned to a global software as a service business model."", ""So as CFO, she's going to lead the global finance organization that includes accounting and controllership, financial planning and analysis, financial systems, Investor Relations, strategic sourcing and procurement and tax and treasury. And her firsthand experience in scaling high growth category leading public software companies, along with her extensive global experience, I think, really make her the ideal CFO for Moody's as we invest in and grow our subscription-based analytics businesses and continue to expand our ratings business around the world. So it's an exciting time for Moody's and I look forward to Noemie jumping in beginning April 1st, and of course she's going to be a regular fixture on this call going forward. Before we get into the results, I also want to thank Caroline Sullivan, who is here with me for her immense contributions and support over the last few months as Moody's Interim-CFO and Caroline will remain as our Chief Accounting Officer and Corporate Controller."", ""So with that, moving on to our results. 2023 really was a defining year for us here at Moody's. We delivered 8% revenue growth, we grew adjusted diluted EPS by 16% and we were an early mover in GenAI adoption and innovation launching our first ever GenAI enabled product in December. And I have to say that the energy and excitement across the organization really was palpable throughout the year as we launched new products, we entered into strategic partnerships with some of the world's leading tech companies and we increased the gap in our Chartis RiskTech100 number one ranking. And as we grew, we also increased our margin by over 100 basis points for the year, all while investing across the firm in technology, in products and in people. And amidst what was a pretty challenging operating environment for our financial services customers, MA delivered ARR growth of 10% with retention rates in the mid-90s."", ""And looking at the three reporting lines of business in MA, that's decision solutions, data and information, and research and insights, we delivered ARR growth of 11%, 10% and 7% respectively. And as we have upped the pace of product development to meet the strong market demand, for tools to better manage risk and to digitize and transform workflows for 2024, we expect MA revenue to grow at approximately 10% with ARR growth in the low double digit percent range. MIS meanwhile delivered 19% growth in the quarter and 6% for the full year. Corporate finance, financial institutions and public project and infrastructure finance, they all achieved double digit revenue growth compared to 2022 on gradually improving market conditions. And I think I used the phrase fragile when describing the markets back on our third quarter earnings call."", ""And this turned out to be true for the Q4 where despite a very active November, December issuance was more muted than we had expected. And we've seen a very constructive start to the year, and consequently our revenue expectations for 2024 are in the high single to low double-digit percent range for MIS and I'll touch on this a bit more on the call, as well as I'm sure some asset specific issuance guidance. So looking out over 2024 and beyond, we're really excited about the great momentum in the business and the tremendous growth potential that we've got in front of us. And to capitalize on these opportunities, we're accelerating and increasing the level of organic investment this year in three critical areas, that's GenAI, new product development and platforming and technology."", ""And this is a delivered investment program to fully capture the power of AI across our business, to expand the reach and connectedness of MA Solutions and accelerate the technology enablement of the ratings agency, all to deliver on our ambitious medium-term targets. Now our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. First, invest in our business whenever we see great opportunities and we are in fact doing that. And second, return capital to stockholders. And this year, we expect to nearly double the amount of capital we return to our stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. And that brings me to our EPS guidance. We're anticipating adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $10.25 to $11 for 2024. This incorporates a little bit wider range at the beginning of the year to capture some of the uncertainty around issuance and we would expect this to narrow during the course of the year."", ""And of note, as you compare 2024 EPS guidance to 2023, you might remember we had some outsized tax benefits in the first half of last year that resulted in a 2023 effective tax rate of 16.9% and for 2024, we're expecting the rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. And if you look through the 2023 benefit at the midpoint of our 2024 range, our 2024 adjusted EPS represents 24% growth rate since 2022 and that's in line with the low double digit percentage growth that we've targeted over the medium term. Now looking at 2023, I want to take a moment to touch on a few data points that highlight what a powerful franchise we have, and also put our 2023 accomplishments into some perspective amidst, as I said, what was a very challenging operating environment for many of our customers last year."", ""And despite relatively modest MIS rated issuance growth of about 5%, we generated approximately $450 million in incremental revenue growth across our entire company. And today, we have a base of recurring revenue of over $4 billion while our more transactional oriented revenue model across a $74 trillion universe of rated debt gives us upside as debt velocity improves. And together, this underpins our confidence in accelerating our revenue growth to the high single to low double digit percent range in 2024. And over the years, we have really built a customer base that's almost like no other company with 97% of the Fortune 100 and 87% of the Forbes 1000 being a Moody's customer today. And the world's leading companies turn to us, they trust our market leading solutions and that gives us a tremendous base to sell into."", ""This shows up in the many external accolades and awards that we've received. We had over 150 last year alone. And I want to give a special shout out to our MIS team as we were awarded best credit rating agency for the 12th year in a row by Institutional Investor, that is great stuff. And I think we all understand our market leading position in ratings, but we've also built a market leading position with our MA business. And for the second year in a row, we were ranked number one in the Chartis RiskTech100 and that was supported by category wins in strategy, banking and insurance, and a number of solutions categories ranging from climate risk to credit risk, to financial crime data and a number more. And understanding the critical importance of attracting and retaining the best talent in this environment, we continue to lean into our culture to make this the kind of place where the brightest minds want to build their careers and help our customers address some of the world's great challenges."", ""So to sustain our growth, you frequently hear about the investments that we make in our solutions to help our customers make better, more informed decisions about risk and we achieved a number of important milestones in 2023, too many to get into on this call, but I am going to focus on just a few of the highlights. In ratings, we continue to expand the markets we serve through Moody's Local. We also developed dedicated teams in digital finance and private credit so that we're at the forefront of opportunities in the global debt markets. In private credit specifically, we're coordinating across our ratings franchise so that we have the engagement, the methodologies and the analytical and commercial resources to be the agency of choice for players in this market, ranging from BDCs to alternative asset managers, insurance companies and debt funds."", ""To further address the private credit opportunity, we added more than 12,000 unrated entities to our CreditView research service in November that triples the breadth of our coverage and provides a new runway for growth for our research business. Another growth opportunity in our Research and Insights business that many of you have heard about is our Research Assistant product, that's our first GenAI enabled product that we launched commercially on December 1st. And it's the first of a number of Gen AI enabled tools that we’re developing and we’re excited about the initial customer feedback and early traction with this product, and I'm sure we're going to touch on this a bit more in the Q&A. We also continue to enhance and expand our massive company database in important ways to create valuable early warning signals for our customers and address the increasing demand for third party risk management."", ""And there were really three elements to that in 2023 that I'll call out. First was integrating our predictive analytic tools and credit scores on over 450 million companies into Orbis. The second was expanding our coverage of over a million AI curated and scored new stories a day that are available in companies in Orbis. And third, leveraging our investment in BitSight over the course of 2023, we integrated over 6 million cyberscores into Orbis, and that number continues to grow. Across decision solutions, we developed new solutions and integrated more datasets to expand the utility of our offerings. And in KYC, our new entity verification tool combines real time registry content with our Orbis data to help our customers identify risky shell companies and minimize the potential for fraud and sanctions risk."", ""With the launch of our most recent Sanctions360 tool, we are the only one in the market who can look through multiple complex layers of corporate hierarchies and ownership structures to identify potential sanctions breaches. In banking, we integrated climate analytics into a broad range of workflow solutions from loan origination to portfolio management to stress testing. And in insurance, in just a year, we more than doubled the number of customers using our cloud based intelligent risk platform, that's a versatile cloud-based risk analytics platform that enables customers to analyze hundreds of millions of commercial and residential locations. It's not just being used by insurers, we are attracting a diverse set of customers who have a tangible and growing need for our more sophisticated climate data and analytics."", ""I have to say I'm proud to report that at the end of January, we signed one of the world's largest banks as a new customer of our climate and catastrophe modeling solutions to support the in-depth climate analysis for required regulatory disclosures and stress testing. And underpinning all of this is our ongoing foundational investments in the business, and these investments will enhance our ability to integrate our data state across all of our customer use cases more efficiently and more effectively. So I hope as you get a sense, there are a lot of exciting things that are happening here at Moody's. And as I take a step back to consider the many opportunities for growth ahead, I really am energized by all that's in front of us. And there are three things that we are doing to really drive future growth, that is land new customers, expand customer relationships and then innovate continuously to deliver more value."", ""And I just touched on the breadth and quality of our existing customer relationships. We've got a fantastic customer base, especially in financial services where we've been developing relationships for literally decades, landing new customers, expanding relationships and innovating with a proven track record of growth. And in recent years, we've been successful in growing these relationships further and diversifying into new areas like KYC and supplier risk management. In fact, our net expansion rate in the financial services sector stands at a healthy 109%, and I think that's a pretty clear indication of our ability to deepen relationships and deliver value. And now leveraging GenAI and our broader content sets and capabilities, expanding and deepening these relationships will continue to be a significant opportunity for us."", ""Now building on these successes, we've got a great opportunity to expand in new customer segments, supporting new use cases. While financial institutions account for about 70% of ARR and MA, there's been very good demand coming from newer relationships beyond the financial services segment, 14% new sales compound annual growth rate over the last two years in these sectors and that's the corporate and public sector. And over that period, we've established significant relationships with major companies in the United States and Europe. We're leveraging our expertise for customer and supplier risk assessment. Our ratings business also has some opportunities to serve existing and new customers, and I think of those as kind of the markets of tomorrow."", ""We've expanded our footprint in domestic and emerging debt markets where the growth is faster than it is in more developed debt markets. And interesting data point, the Moody's Local initiative in Latin America, which you've heard me talk about, it's a great example of doing that where organic revenue grew 22% in 2023. So these land and expand opportunities are supported by major secular trends that are driving demand for our offerings, and I would cite a few of those. We're poised to capitalize on the content, unlock opportunities from GenAI enablement and innovation; the widespread digitization and transformation programs across banks and insurers, the growing demand for third party risk management solutions and the ongoing growth of the private credit sector."", ""And with our wide range and capabilities that we've put together to deliver this holistic view of risk, I think we are uniquely well positioned at the intersection of these trends. So I can assure you that we reflected a lot on these opportunities as we entered our annual operating plan cycle this fall. And not dissimilar to past years, we were challenged to prioritize and balance organic investments with operational efficiency and productivity initiatives. On the efficiency side, we expect to generate savings from resource redeployment, alternative staffing models, automation and GenAI enablement and geolocation strategies, and we're prioritizing investment spending on areas that are enabling us to deliver at our current growth rates, including SaaS based product development, sales deployment, operational resiliency and ratings workflows."", ""And these initiatives are really funded within our what we think of as our regular pace of operating margin expansion. But as we exited the initial sprint around GenAI innovation last year, we reflected on the opportunities ahead of us. We considered the deep customer relationships that I've just touched on, our unique data assets that you hear us talk about, the market trends that I just mentioned, together with our growth strategy. And we proactively upped the organic investments that we started in the summer of last year. And we are increasing our budgeted operating expenses for 2024 by an additional $60 million in three primary investment areas. First, and I'm sure this isn't particularly surprising is GenAI. We're increasing product related investments across MA that will continue to build on our early mover momentum from 2023 and investments across the company and initiatives to accelerate employee adoption and improve productivity."", ""On the product side, we have a few really interesting things that are moving ahead fairly quickly. So CreditLens, which is our flagship banking origination solution will be the next to launch a GenAI enabled capability to generate a credit memo within seconds, leveraging the digitized information about borrowers and their credit facilities that is stored natively in our software. And we're going to be saving loan officers and credit professionals countless hours compiling information and generating the first draft of the documents that are produced with virtually every commercial loan. We've got our first beta customer already and we are currently in preview with a number of other customers. I'm also very encouraged by our new GenAI enabled commercial real estate early warning system that we believe will significantly enhance commercial real estate portfolio monitoring capabilities for both lenders and investors."", ""And I actually just sat through a demo of this in the last week or two. And the early warning system integrates a wide range of our data sets. It enables the evaluation of news events in real time, running scenarios and calculations that link together market forecasts, listings and property data, tenant data and valuation and credit models. And again, the early feedback has been very positive and we're already looking to extend these capabilities beyond just commercial real estate. Now from an internal perspective, we've rolled out GitHub Copilot and some other GenAI tools to more than 1,500 engineering professionals across the company. And as a result of our experience last year, we've specifically planned for efficiency gains in our engineering budgets in 2024."", ""We're also rolling out our next generation of AI enabled tools for our sales teams across the company over the next several months. So that's the first area. The second area is product development. And as part of our land and expand strategy in MA, we are building on the success and momentum of our KYC business, which has grown to over $300 million of ARR in just a few years. And I think those of you who've been on this call for a while, you've heard me mention before that Know Your Customer is probably too limiting of a term for this business as it continues to expand. So this year, we're increasing investments to develop solutions focused on the growing market demand really for solutions to serve their customer and supplier risk needs. And we're especially encouraged by recent wins with a number of large government and Fortune 100 customers."", ""So this year, we're going to make investments in product, technology and data and go-to-market capabilities to be able to scale in these customer segments. The ratings ecosystem also continues to evolve. In early January, we were just provided with the very first -- we just had the very first rating on a tokenized bond fund. And while digital finance is still nascent, we're going to be ready to help our customers delivering our ratings on the platforms wherever they are going to issue. So that's second. And then third is around technology platforming. So we're building on the platforming work that we highlighted in our Innovation Open House event back in September. And as we explained then, this work is critical to strengthening the interoperability of all of our data estate and improving the synergies across our solutions."", ""By investing in our platforming and engineering capabilities, we're going to accelerate our time to market, enhance the customer experience, better enable cross sell and upsell and deliver engineering efficiencies. The faster this work gets done, the sooner we will realize the revenue and efficiency benefits, so we have decided to hit the accelerator. The same is true in ratings, where more tech enabled workflow is really key to the quality, speed, efficiency and compliance. And we've been on a journey to modernize, digitize and automate our systems. We've made some good headway but there is still more work to be done. Now optimizing our data estate and moving more of our workflow into cloud-based applications really has never been more important given the promise of AI and the digitization of financial markets."", ""So here too, we decided to accelerate our efforts and this will be critical in achieving our medium-term margin targets. So now let me turn to our issuance outlook very briefly. We're expecting more constructive market conditions in 2024. And I'm sure, as you have all seen, it was a very busy start to the year, over $150 billion in investment grade issuance in January alone. Underpinning our MIS revenue growth outlook of high single to low double digits is an increase in MIS rated issuance in the mid to high single digit percent range. For corporates, we expect that leverage finance will grow faster than investment grade issuance, which should be favorable to revenue mix. And our outlook is built on the macroeconomic assumptions that are detailed on Page 20 of our webcast deck and notably incorporating a soft landing here in the US and rate cuts starting in the second quarter of this year."", ""And I imagine we'll dive deeper into both our issuance and macroeconomic assumptions in the Q&A session. Now before moving off of MIS, I do want to highlight that early last year, we committed to reviewing our medium-term guidance for MIS revenue growth once we saw a sustainable improvement in the debt markets. And I'm happy to share that following 6% revenue growth in 2023 and the expectation of at least high single digit growth in 2024, we have updated our medium term revenue growth target for MIS to be in the mid to high single digit percent growth range. Now moving back to our 2024 annual guidance. Moody's revenue is expected to grow in the high single to low double digit percent range. The Moody's adjusted operating margin is projected to be in the range of 44% to 46%, that's about 100 basis points of margin improvement at the midpoint."", ""And the Moody's revenue and adjusted operating margin guidance ranges incorporate the variability of that MIS transaction based revenue and then balanced against the subscription base in MA where nearly 95% of our revenues are recurring. In regards to M&A, we're guiding to a tighter range of approximately 10% revenue growth and low double digit growth in ARR. Now MA's adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 30% to 31% this year, that's absorbing the impact of the incremental organic investments that I just talked about. In the medium term, we expect MA's adjusted operating margin to be in the mid 30s percent range. And as I have discussed with a number of you, the path to that target is not exactly linear. For 2024, MIS' adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 55.5% to 57.5%, that is a 200 basis point improvement versus 2023 at the midpoint and that is solidly on towards the medium-term target of low 60s percent."", ""Our expenses overall are expected to grow in the mid to high single digit percent range. A couple of factors worth noting, first, we closed out our 2022, ‘23 geolocation restructuring program at the end of 2023. Caroline can talk more about that. Second, we’re expecting depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $450 million in 2024, that's an increase of approximately 20% as compared to 2023. And that growth is largely related to the cumulative effect of our shift towards developing exclusively SaaS based solutions starting back in 2021, and coupled with the increased capital expenditures associated with the three primary areas of incremental organic investment that I just talked about. And we're expecting free cash flow of between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range, as I said earlier, of $10.25 to $11, again, a 24% increase at the midpoint versus 2022 looking through those tax benefits that I touched on."", ""So I'll wrap up by just saying it was a really great year for us here in 2023. I'm expecting an even more exciting one ahead. I'm energized by our strategy. We've got fantastic engagement across the company. And we believe that now is the time to invest in the opportunity that's in front of us to fully embrace the power of AI across our business, to accelerate the build out of our technology platform and to bring together our content to build new solutions with unique value propositions that will accelerate growth. So with that, I welcome Caroline, Steve and Mike to join me for Q&A. And operator, please open the call up to questions."", 'See also 13 Countries with Easy Citizenship for Retirement and Top 20 Defense Contractors in 2024.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PG&E?', ""For PG&E, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.55%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PG&E will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PG&E would post earnings of $0.28 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.24, delivering a surprise of -14.29%.', 'The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

The company's financial tables indicate a solid performance, with a focus on land mobile radios, radio network infrastructure, surveillance equipment, and dispatch software. With a significant portion of revenue stemming from government agencies and a growing presence in the private sector, MSI's financial stability is underscored by its diverse customer base and commitment to safety and security."", ""Market Leadership and Brand Reputation: Motorola Solutions Inc (NYSE:MSI) has established itself as a leader in the field of communications and analytics, particularly in the public safety sector. The company's strong brand, built on nearly a century of innovation and customer collaboration, has resulted in a loyal customer base that trusts MSI for its reliable and advanced technology solutions.

Earlier forms of the technology have been around for decades, but these next-generation algorithms can do so much more. This includes creating a variety of original content, including images, text, and audio.', 'Beyond creating new content, generative AI can summarize emails and draft potential responses, create presentations from existing data, search the internet and company databases using specific criteria, and even draft and debug computer code.', 'Microsoft co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates has said, ""The development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone."" That\'s a bold proclamation, but the chorus of tech aficionados that concur is growing louder.', 'While there are plenty of AI stocks poised to reap the benefits of this transition, the one with arguably the most potential upside is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).', ""Nvidia pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that rendered the lifelike images that revolutionized the video game industry. However, it was the decision to adapt that technology to other applications that was instrumental in the company's success in AI. Parallel processing, the underlying technology that made GPUs so effective, takes computationally complex jobs and breaks them into smaller bits, making them more manageable."", ""From those humble beginnings, Nvidia has adapted its technology to a long and growing list of applications, including high-performance computing, cloud computing, data centers, and AI. Each new use case expanded the company's total addressable market, which management estimated at $1 trillion early last year -- and that was before the rapid adoption of generative AI began in earnest."", ""The company's recent results help illustrate the large and growing opportunity. In Nvidia's fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29), it delivered record revenue of $18.1 billion, which surged 206%, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.71 soared 1,274%. While easy comps from the prior year skewed the overall results, the implications are clear. Lest there be any doubt, it was the company's data center segment, which includes chips used for AI processing, that did the heavy lifting -- generating record revenue of $14.5 billion, jumping 279% -- and accounting for 80% of the company's revenue."", ""Nvidia is scheduled to report the results of its fiscal fourth quarter next week, and its forecast was eye-opening. The company guided for record revenue of $20 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, up 230% year over year. Management's commentary left no doubt that it was AI driving this train."", ""As the potential use cases for AI grow, so too do the estimates of the opportunity. Conservative estimates suggest generative AI could be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Investment Management, is much more bullish, estimating the total addressable market for AI could be as high as $37 trillion by 2030. While it's difficult to pin down the exact size of the opportunity, it's sure to be substantial -- and Nvidia's processors provide the technology that makes it all possible."", 'There are other reasons to believe Nvidia stock will only go higher from here. The company controls an estimated 95% of the data center market, according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino. The data center market is expected to rise from $263 billion in 2022 to $603 billion by 2030, according to Prescient and Strategic Intelligence Market Research. As the leader in the space, Nvidia will ride that tailwind higher.', 'The company also dominates the field of machine learning -- an established branch of AI. Nvidia has a market share estimated at 95%, according to data compiled by New Street Research.', ""This helps illustrate the inexorable ties between data centers and AI -- and Nvidia is the clear choice in both. As companies continue to adopt generative AI, there's every indication that Nvidia processors will continue to be the industry standard."", ""There's the hotly contested subject of valuation to be considered. Using the most commonly employed metrics, Nvidia is selling for 96 times earnings and 40 times sales (as of this writing), which is enough to make value investors run for cover -- but other metrics tell a different story."", ""Nvidia has been generating triple-digit growth, which is expected to continue -- at least over the short term. As such, that growth must, of necessity, be factored into its valuation. Enter Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 1 -- the benchmark for an undervalued stock."", 'The digital transformation and adoption of AI show no signs of slowing and will likely accelerate from here.

While Amazon Web Services (AWS) may only account for 15% of the company's top-line revenue, Amazon's cloud business accounts for two-thirds of the company's operating profits. Better still, AWS' sales improved by 13% last year, driving this unit's operating income up by more than 15%. Not bad. Not bad at all."", ""However, if you think Amazon's cloud computing business is bulletproof, think again. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is coming on strong, closing the gap between the two companies' cloud computing market share. Amazon can't afford to let this rival continue going unchecked. Or, maybe AWS isn't in a position to prevent it."", ""Don't misread the message. There's still lots of cloud computing business to go around. Numbers from Synergy Research Group suggest worldwide cloud infrastructure spending grew 20% year over year last quarter, capping off a similarly strong full year. Amazon is still the market leader, too."", ""Amazon's market share is dwindling, however, while Microsoft's share of the cloud computing market is clearly growing at a much faster clip. The graphic below tells the tale."", ""That's not catastrophic for Amazon -- at least not yet. As was noted, AWS experienced solid revenue and earnings growth in 2023. It's just that Microsoft is now faring so much better on this front. Its cloud revenue was up 20% year over year for the three-month stretch ending in December, mirroring the arm's forward fiscal progress during the quarter previous to that one."", ""With several years' worth of this growth disparity on the table, the threat to Amazon's cloud business is getting much bigger in the rearview mirror."", 'What gives? How is Microsoft able to outpace Amazon in a business that Amazon largely pioneered?', ""A great deal of the credit has to be given to Microsoft's cloud-computing technology, and its Azure platform in particular. In simplest terms, Azure is a platform that allows Microsoft's cloud computing customers to access dozens of cloud management tools in one interface. Its enterprise-level clients don't have to use Azure. But, given its ease of use and affordability, most customers gladly pay for the option."", ""AWS comes with a comparable interface for its users, for the record. It's just not the same, though."", ""Then there's the other, arguably bigger distinguishing factor. That is, although both companies are able to offer such tech, organizations looking to build artificial intelligence tools seem to prefer Microsoft over Amazon."", ""That can't come as a complete surprise. Artificial intelligence developer OpenAI licensed its GPT-3 technology to Microsoft all the way back in 2020 -- well before the chat-capable platform thrust AI onto center stage. Already strong based on what ChatGPT could do, Microsoft's 2023 earmarking of $13 billion worth of current and future investments in OpenAI only further cements the relationship into place. The duo is quickly becoming the go-to provider for AI solutions, even when customers don't even entirely know what it is they want to achieve with AI, or how to do it."", ""Again, AWS just doesn't have the same AI edge."", 'And that presents a profit problem for the e-commerce behemoth.', ""As could have been expected, AWS' profits -- and profit margins -- grew as the business expanded through early 2022. Then inflation took hold, pinching those profits. This pressure has eased since the latter part of last year. The bottom line is leveling off, though, and it's arguable that even Amazon's cloud computing revenue growth is slowing down."", ""This makes sense. As any market becomes more competitive, one of the first and easiest moves to make is cutting prices. And AWS has done exactly that in recent years. At the same time, AWS' long-term customers are increasingly finding ways to lower their cloud computing costs as well."", ""These are all victories of a sort, in that they keep paying customers on board. These price cuts and cost-reducing strategies aren't necessarily matched with reductions in AWS' own operating costs, however. AWS' fourth-quarter lull in operating profit margin rates may well be a hint of what's to come in the near and distant future."", ""Microsoft's cloud business is likely running into the same headwind, to be fair. But Microsoft's got far more ways to monetize its business customers. It's also not nearly as dependent on its cloud computing arm for operating income as Amazon is, with only about half of Microsoft's bottom line coming from a much wider array of cloud computing profit centers."", ""It's not that Amazon is un-ownable here.

Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) estimates that the generative AI market could grow 40%-plus annually and reach $1.2 trillion by 2032. That level of growth will also create an estimated $280 billion in new revenue opportunities from software alone.', 'Emerging new industries are exciting, but picking the long-term winners can be challenging. For all investors know, the most prolific company of the next 20 years might not even exist yet. That suggests casting a wide net could be the best investment strategy. In this case, the best approach might be to find the early winners, own their stocks, and follow how AI progresses over time.', ""After pouring through dozens of companies, these five stood out for their strong positions to lead the industry's growth. Consider buying and holding these AI stocks. They enjoy pole positions in the AI industry and could generate life-changing investment returns over the next decade and beyond."", ""Artificial intelligence (AI) might seem like it became Wall Street's hottest trend overnight. Seemingly just as quickly, graphics chip company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has taken a stranglehold on the market for chips used to power AI models (it controls as much as 90% of the market). One of its competitors, Advanced Micro Devices, estimates the AI chip market will grow to $400 billion over the next several years. Do the math, and Nvidia's companywide revenue of $45 billion over the past year looks poised to skyrocket."", ""The competition will chase Nvidia, but the company's high-performance chips, combined with its popular CUDA computing software optimized to get the most out of them, create a turnkey package the industry keeps opting for. Perhaps Nvidia's competitors weren't ready for the AI surge. Shares have gained over 230% this past year alone, but the long-term demand for AI chips seems poised to drive the stock even higher as Nvidia grows."", ""Ironically, most chip companies, including Nvidia, don't build their chips. They only design them. Chip factories, called fabs, do the building and require cutting-edge machines to make intricate patterns on silicon wafers. ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) designs and builds extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, which are used to create the most advanced chips hitting the market today."", 'Remarkably, ASML is the only company that makes this type of machine. This machine is so complex that it takes 13 shipping containers and 250 crates to ship and costs up to $400 million each. Naturally, AI and general technology will continue progressing. Breakthroughs will require increasingly better machines to make better chips. ASML should be a long-term beneficiary of the AI boom.', 'Big technology companies are spending to build advanced computer systems, but smaller enterprises want to use AI technology to help run their businesses. Because of this, Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) is seeing growth take off. The company sells custom software applications built on three proprietary platforms: Gotham, Foundry, and AIP. Specifically, AIP was designed for building and deploying AI in commercial applications.', ""Palantir gets over half its revenue from government customers, the U.S. government being its largest and oldest customer. However, the commercial segment is thriving. Palantir's enterprise customer base grew 55% year over year in the fourth quarter and 22% over the previous three months to 221. That's just a couple of hundred companies in a broader corporate landscape of millions. If companies worldwide need AI to compete, Palantir could grow for years."", ""Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), better known as Supermicro, has evolved from selling components to complete IT solutions over the decades. However, the explosion of data center demand for AI is beginning to reach Supermicro, and the business is taking off. The company's revenue growth has accelerated, and management believes its total revenue will double this fiscal year (ending over the summer)."", ""Again, its success makes sense. Companies need AI capabilities, but non-technical businesses are far better off hiring a third party like Supermicro to come in and build a system for them. The modular design makes it easier to expand the system if their computing needs grow over time. Management estimates they're growing five times faster than the broader industry, meaning customers choose them over others. It's promising for Supermicro's long-term trajectory and shareholders alike."", ""The AI hype may have begun with ChatGPT, a generative AI chatbot built by OpenAI. Tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) jumped on the opportunity and furthered its partnership with OpenAI, tying OpenAI's growth to its cloud platform, Azure. That has already bore fruit. Microsoft reported an uptick in Azure's growth in its latest quarter, noting that over half the Fortune 500 already uses Azure and OpenAI in their businesses. Azure is the world's second-leading cloud platform, only trailing Amazon's AWS."", ""But with Microsoft, you get a diversified business with revenue streams from cloud, gaming, enterprise software, and more. Its massive size and deep pockets also give it a higher floor than most stocks you'll come across. Of course, a $3.1 trillion market cap means it's probably too large to make you a millionaire alone. Instead, expect a steady portfolio performer that generally grinds higher over time."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

In other words, it offers an inside look at what stocks, industries, and trends are piquing the interest of the brightest asset managers."", ""There's perhaps no bigger intrigue at the moment than knowing what Wall Street's top money managers are doing with artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. AI, which involves using software and systems to handle tasks that would typically be overseen by humans, could add an estimated $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030, according to a report released last year by PwC."", ""Based on the latest round of 13F filings, billionaire investors were eager to pare down their stakes in two ultra-popular AI stocks and simply couldn't stop buying shares of another brand-name AI-inspired company."", ""The first artificial intelligence stock that prominent billionaire investors have been kicking to the curb is none other than the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). During the December-ended quarter, eight billionaires reduced their fund's respective stakes in this semiconductor giant, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):"", 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares).', 'Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares).', 'Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares).', 'David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares).', 'Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares).', 'Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares).', 'John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares).', ""If you're wondering why these top investors would lighten their load on Wall Street's hottest megacap stock, increasing competition and margin cannibalization may be the answer."", ""For the moment, Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate AI-accelerated data centers. Analysts at Citigroup have estimated that Nvidia's chips could account for a 90% share of GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers this year. But competition is picking up. Advanced Micro Devices will be increasing the rollout of its MI300X GPU this year, while Intel is debuting its Gaudi3 generative AI software chip as a direct competitor to the H100 later this year."", ""Internal competition is a potential problem, too. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Meta Platforms are Nvidia's respective No. 1 and No. 2 in total spending. But even though these companies are spending big bucks with Nvidia, they're hard at work developing their own AI chips. Sooner than later, Microsoft and Meta's reliance on Nvidia should lessen."", ""Nvidia's expansion could also, ironically, be its undoing -- at least when it comes to the company's gross margin. The bulk of Nvidia's data-center growth in fiscal 2024 (ended in late January) was the result of A100 and H100 GPU scarcity. When a product is scarce and in high demand, the seller typically commands exceptional pricing power. As Nvidia ramps up production of its high-powered GPUs, it could cannibalize its own stellar pricing power."", ""The other AI stock that billionaires have thrown out with the bath water is the world's largest publicly traded company by market cap, Microsoft. Despite investing aggressively in OpenAI (the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT) and developing its own AI chips, seven genius billionaire investors were sellers during Q4, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):"", 'Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (3,024,399 shares).', 'Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,569,462 shares).', 'Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (1,155,782 shares).', 'Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (796,892 shares).', 'Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (787,113 shares).', 'Terry Smith of Fundsmith (705,498 shares).', 'Dan Loeb of Third Point (210,000 shares)', ""Viking Global and Renaissance Technologies completely exited their fund's stakes in the world's largest public company. The reasoning behind these sales may boil down to a combination of history and valuation."", 'Over the past 30 years, there has been no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends. While some of these trends have made long-term investors notably richer (e.g., the advent of the internet and cloud computing), every next-big-thing investment has navigated its way through an initial bubble. This is to say that investors regularly overestimate the early uptake of new innovations or technologies, and AI is unlikely to be an exception.', ""Microsoft's valuation is another potential sticking point. Investors right now would be paying a multiple of 31 times forward-year earnings, which is a far cry from the year-end multiple of 16 to 25 times forward-year earnings investors were paying between 2014 and 2018."", ""The one thing that could ultimately make these billionaires regret their decision to sell is Microsoft's incredible cash flow. The perfect blend of high-margin cash flow from its legacy segments (e.g., Windows and Office), coupled with high-growth initiatives like cloud service infrastructure-platform Azure, afford Microsoft the luxury to take chances on the acquisition and innovation front."", 'However, not all artificial intelligence stocks were off-limits by billionaire money managers during the December-ended quarter. E-commerce company Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which is utilizing generative AI in a variety of ways to enhance voice interactions with Alexa, as well as help merchants create more compelling and tailored advertisements, was a popular buy for eight billionaires, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):', 'Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares).', 'Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares).', 'Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares).', 'Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares).', 'John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares).', 'Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares).', 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares).', ""Although AI contributes to the lure of Amazon's various products and services, billionaires are most likely piling in because of the company's three rapidly growing ancillary segments."", ""Most consumers are probably familiar with Amazon because it has the most-dominant online marketplace in the United States. While this segment is responsible for a lot of revenue, online retail sales produce low margins. The lion's share of Amazon's cash flow can be traced back to its cloud-infrastructure service segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), as well as subscription services and advertising services."", ""AWS is Amazon's superstar. It's the leading provider of cloud-infrastructure services globally and is approaching $97 billion in annual run rate sales. Not only is enterprise spending on cloud-infrastructure services still in its early innings, but the margins associated with cloud services put e-commerce margins to shame. It's not uncommon for AWS to account for more than half of Amazon's operating income."", 'The other catalyst that encouraged billionaires to mash the buy button for Amazon stock during Q4 might be its valuation. While the traditional price-to-earnings ratio is liable to have value investors running in the opposite direction, Amazon is historically cheap relative to its cash flow.', 'Cash flow tends to be a smarter way of valuing Amazon given its penchant for reinvesting most of its operating cash flow back into its logistics operations and various high-growth initiatives. After spending the entirety of the 2010s valued between 23- and 37-times year-end cash flow, investors can buy shares today for about 12 times consensus cash-flow estimates in 2025.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

', ""With the first quarter of the 21st century about to be over, the Internet of today is vastly different from the one that had taken shape at the tail end of the dotcom era of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. Now, the Internet proliferates every aspect of life, whether it's transportation, work, entertainment, leisure, or even buying groceries. Additionally, two and a half decades after the start of the new century, a handful of players since the dotcom era have survived and now reign supreme in the stock market."", ""These bigwigs include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). However, 2024 is turning out to be a year that appears to be challenging the dominance of big technology as the market value of the semiconductor designer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has started to rival that of the world's biggest electronic commerce company Amazon and Alphabet, whose search engine reigns supreme in nearly every country in the world."", ""The significant transformation that the Internet has undergone over the course of the past decades also means that now, there are new technologies and industries that were un-thought of when Jeff Bezos first started delivering books. One such technology is blockchain, a secure ledger that gained popularity along with Bitcoin, the world's premier cryptocurrency. The emergence of blockchain technologies, companies, and stocks comes as technology permeates not only our daily lives but also the business operations of giants belonging to crucial industries such as financial services and logistics."", 'A blockchain, for those out of the loop, is a collection of computers that store information. And since running a business requires storing copious amounts of information, it offers companies and management a secure ledge that is stored on multiple computers at the same time to ensure that even if one node of the network goes out of operation, the record integrity remains unaffected.', 'Naturally, this utility that the blockchain industry has slowly grown to be worth quite a bit. For instance, as part of our coverage of 11 Most Promising Blockchain Stocks According to Analysts, we discovered several blockchain stocks that had impressive share price upside. The top three stocks in this list, which ranked the companies by the percentage upside of their average analyst share price targets as of mid December 2023, were Canaan Inc. (NASDAQ:CAN), Applied Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:APLD), and Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR). The share price upside percentage for these blockchain stocks all stood in either double or triple digits, indicating that when it comes to selecting blockchain stocks for investment purposes, at least analysts believe that they offer at least some potential.', 'Delving deeper into the business operations of these top blockchain stocks, it appears that at least when it comes to the top of the food chain for investment recommendations, either companies that sell hardware for blockchain use or those that engage in Bitcoin mining reign supreme. Bitcoin and blockchains are closely tied to each other, since at its simplest level, a Bitcoin is simply a reward token to a miner given for computing resources spent powering up a blockchain network.', 'The next step in our analysis of the blockchain industry and the biggest blockchain companies is to see whether this trend also holds for the most valuable blockchain companies in the world in terms of market capitalization. Some of the most valuable companies, when it comes to either operating blockchains or offering software based products that use the technology are International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc.

Inflation in December was 3.4% on a year-to-year basis.\xa0', ""Despite the decrease in inflation figures, it is now clear that the post-pandemic price increase is more stubborn than predicted. The breakdown of the CPI increase indicates that despite a fall in inflation, certain necessities have become more expensive. The major portion of this decline in inflation can be attributed to the fall of gasoline prices in January on a seasonally adjusted basis. However, food prices still went up by 0.4%. In addition, shelter prices increased by 0.6% on a month-on-month basis and 6% on a 12-month basis. In the context of the consumer price index, the shelter price index refers to the cost of housing, including rent and the owner's equivalent rent (OER).\xa0"", ""It is becoming increasingly difficult to manage the cost of living, and many people wishing to settle in large cities are becoming cautious.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) has been quite active over the last few years to ensure that its workers can meet the cost of living. The company recently raised the wages of its warehouse and delivery workers to $20.5 per hour, up from $19 per hour. In the year 2018, Amazon.com, Inc.

Last year, tech giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) held off on raising salaries of full-time employees. The company cited economic conditions and investment in artificial intelligence as reasons for this move. It is worth noting that in 2022, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) almost doubled its budget for merit increases for certain employees. However, these employees will have to make do with the same salaries. These Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) employees were still entitled to bonuses and stock award budgets.\xa0', 'While some companies are increasing the salaries and wages of their employees, others are reacting to the inflation in the form of pay cuts. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of those companies. After a lower sales forecast, the company reduced the salaries by as much as 25%. Middle-level Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) employees saw a pay cut of 5%, whereas the higher pay cut affected the higher-level employees. It is worth noting that these cuts did not apply to hourly wage workers working at Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)', ""To curate our list of the 20 cities with the highest cost of living in the US, we used two indexes.

The housing construction is not keeping pace with the population growth in the city.\xa0', 'Philadelphia has a high demand for housing in the city center and surrounding areas.

Significant steps have been taken toward making all packaging recyclable, and part of the progress has come in an unexpected place - nail polish remover bottle caps.', 'Preferred plastics', '""By switching from black plastic caps to white plastic caps in just these seven Walgreens brand products, we\'re able to improve the recyclability of a projected 13 tons of plastic,"" says Andrew Horn, senior manager of sustainability operations. ""Many recycling facilities use mechanical vision systems, essentially robots with cameras for eyes, to sort packaging that comes in. They have a difficult time correctly identifying black plastic. So, too often, they\'ll put it in the waste stream or just inaccurately sort it into the wrong recycling stream.""', 'Within the beauty and personal care products industry, black plastic is commonly used for packaging. Walgreens chose to break away from that norm when the opportunity arose to reduce the negative impacts of plastics in Walgreens brand nail polish remover packaging. Dionne Carloni, manager of packaging sciences, worked with product managers and suppliers to identify recyclable plastic options and put those into use across the beauty and personal care product line.', '""We strive to eliminate carbon black plastic from Walgreens brand packaging whenever possible, even if that means deviating from comparable national brand packaging,"" says Carloni. ""It\'s a risk because we rely on colors to help our customers navigate to our products, but it\'s a change we\'ve committed to in order to improve the recyclability of our packaging.""', 'Another area with growing success is eliminating the use of PVC plastic commonly seen in ""blister packaging"" - think of toothbrush packages with their cardboard backs and plastic fronts.', '""Recycling centers have an extremely difficult time recycling PVC, and most municipal facilities here in the U.S. don\'t handle it at all,"" says Horn. ""If we want to be 100% recyclable, we can\'t use PVC. We take a proactive approach with suppliers when discussing materials, and if they are proposing PVC, we tell them not to. PVC can often be replaced with a PET plastic that\'s much more recyclable and is indistinguishable to customers.""', 'How 2 Recycle', ""However, it doesn't matter how recyclable the packaging is if it doesn't make it into the recycle bin. That's where the How 2 Recycle product labelling guidelines come in. These easy-to-understand icons, standardized across the U.S. and Canadian packaged goods industry, are typically found on the back or bottom of a product to make it clear what should go into the recycling."", '""We have a lot of success with getting recycling information on our products so consumers know how to dispose our packaging,"" says Carloni. ""We\'re taking the steps to make our products more recyclable, and then we\'re giving consumers the information to do it, too.""', 'Looking ahead', ""To get to the 2030 commitments Walgreens has made, there's more work to be done. But the team is committed and up for the challenge, drawing professional passion from personal experiences."", '""Back when I was in Girl Scouts, we collected newspapers to recycle and measured the saved trees. That experience propelled me towards a path where I actively sought opportunities to contribute to a more sustainable world,"" says Carloni. ""When I started in the packaging field over 15 years ago, sustainability was a really tough path because not a lot of companies had committed to it. I\'m glad that progress has been made since then, and I\'m really grateful that Walgreens has taken the initiative to push some of these solutions into the marketplace.""', 'For Horn, an avid back-country skier and camper, his love of the outdoors attracted him to his career path that helps create a healthier planet for future generations to enjoy.', '""Saving something, or repurposing, reusing, reducing … just kind of plays into who I am at my core,"" says Horn.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Xcel Energy Inc.

Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' View our latest analysis for Xcel Energy ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Xcel Energy is:', '10% = US$1.8b ÷ US$17b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.10."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that Xcel Energy has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Electric Utilities industry (8.8%)."", ""That isn't amazing, but it is respectable. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Xcel Energy."", ""Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking."", ""Xcel Energy does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.57. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it."", 'Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.', 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

So, you may want to check if Synopsys is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.', ""Synopsys doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the decent earnings growth number that we discussed above."", ""In total, we are pretty happy with Synopsys' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth.

With a heritage of innovation and sustainability, PPG has cemented its position as a top-tier coatings provider, serving a diverse range of end-users. Despite the volatility of raw material costs, which have remained high historically, PPG successfully reduced its operating costs by more than $500 million in 2023.

Reported EPS is $0.06, expectations were $0.01. CoreCard Corporation isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', 'Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the CoreCard Q4 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Matt White, CFO. Thank you. Please go ahead.', ""Matt White: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. With me on the call today is Leland Strange, Chairman and CEO of CoreCard Corporation. He will add some additional comments and answer questions at the conclusion of my prepared remarks. Before I start, I'd like to remind everyone that during the call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand CoreCard Corporation and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risk factors, uncertainty and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Factor that may affect future operations are included in our filings with the SEC, including our 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We'll also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted diluted EPS, which is adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance."", 'These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables included with our earnings release. As we noted in our press release, our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations, and with continued year-over-year growth in processing and maintenance revenue. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $12.2 million, a 23% decrease year-over-year. Services revenue, defined as total revenue excluding license revenue, decreased 13% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, with full year growth of 1%. The components of our revenue for the fourth quarter consisted of professional services revenue of $6.1 million, processing and maintenance revenue of $5.5 million and third-party revenue of $0.5 million. Processing and maintenance revenues grew 8% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis with full year growth of 18%.', 'The decline in professional services revenue was driven by lower demand for development personnel from Goldman Sachs, our largest customer. As a reminder, we converted the managed services revenue we received from Goldman, which is included in professional services, to a fixed monthly fee of $1 million, which is contracted through June 30, 2025. Maintenance revenue from Goldman was approximately $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, and that is contracted through June 30, 2026. Revenue growth, excluding our largest customer and excluding the impact from ParkMobile, which we talked about in the last quarter, and the legacy Kabbage business, which is currently in runoff, was 12% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis and 13% for the full year.', ""We continue to onboard new customers, both directly and through various partnerships we have with program managers such as Deserve, Vervent and Cardless. We currently have multiple implementations in progress with new customers that we expect to go live in the coming months. However, these new customers typically build their account base prudently, remember they're issuing credit, paying mostly our minimum fees initially of around $10,000 to $15,000 per month in the initial 12 to 18 months of their program. We expect our new customers to become more significant over time as they grow their own business at a measured pace. Now, turning to some additional highlights for the fourth quarter and full year for 2023. Income from operations was $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to income from operations of $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2022."", 'Our operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 3% compared to an operating margin of 19% for the same period last year. The year-over-year decline in our operating margin was primarily driven by continued investments in our new platform, hiring in India and lower license and professional services revenue year-over-year. The income statement impact of our new platform build was $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $1.8 million for the full year. Those amounts are included in our development expenses on our income statement. Fiscal 2023 and 2022 tax rate was 24.5% and 27.1%, respectively. We expect our ongoing tax rate to be between 25% and 27%. Earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.06 compared to $0.12 for the fourth quarter of 2022.', 'Full year 2023 diluted EPS was $0.40 compared to $1.61 for the full year 2022. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter, excluding the fourth quarter 2022 impact of a write-down of one of our equity method investments was $0.06 compared to $0.24 for Q4 2022. Full year 2023 adjusted diluted EPS was $0.52 compared to $1.74 for the full year 2022. We generated significant operating cash flows in 2023 of $16.8 million. We used $3.7 million on share repurchases in 2023, including $2.1 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2023. We have excess cash on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, and we expect to continue generating operating cash flow in 2024. We plan to use this excess cash and cash generated from operations to continue investing in our new platform and to continue buying back shares, especially at current price levels.', ""For 2024, we expect services revenue to be approximately flat and license revenue of approximately $1.4 million, coming in the second half. We expect growth from customers, excluding our largest customer and excluding the impact of ParkMobile and legacy Kabbage, which is all services revenue, to be approximately 11%. Within services, we expect continued growth in processing and maintenance as our customers continue to grow and as we add new customers. We anticipate professional services revenue in the first quarter of 2024 in the range of $6 million to $6.2 million. And with that, I'll turn it over to Leland."", ""Leland Strange: Yeah, thanks, Matt. Let me just say start planning your questions now because my comments are going to be short. First, let me comment on the lack of license revenue for the quarter. As most of you know, license revenue comes in buckets of about 1 million new cards and we had none. And I don't think we expect it in the first half of the year. There have been pundits trying to extrapolate the success or failure or the growth or lack of growth or maybe just translate that to measure the success of the card program of our largest customer. That's bad logic and a mistake. The largest individual brand processed on our software continues to grow their program, and it continues to be a phenomenal success. How can that be if there are no new license as well."", ""Our licensee process more than one program with their license from CoreCard. And the CoreCard license revenue is not split by program, but it's for the total number of active cards that they process. For example, if one of the programs should clean their books by canceling old unused cards, that would be one way that will slow new license revenue and could possibly mislead one as the growth of the other program. Also, the license revenues on active cards, depending on definition, some cards could become inactive. I should say here, however, that the largest program of the system probably has the most average number of transactions of any large program [that I've ever seen] (ph). The cardholders love the card. They also use it for breakfast, lunch and dinner on the same day, plus a lot of other daily transactions."", ""So, it's a very, very good program. And even though we may not have new license revenue in the first half, the program itself is growing at a good rate. Second, let me comment on Matt's statement that the projected adjusted growth for services in 2024 is about 11%. Now, I'm not happy with that slow growth rate, but he's probably right based on the new business we're currently working with. I'm hopeful we can squeeze some other business in this year or that some of them will grow faster than projected, but it may end up being in that range. Third, as most of you know, we've historically not spent much of this development and have been in a good position of business finding us. Well, that was done in the past, and we recognize that we were prioritizing providing excellent service for our largest partner to enable their growth plans."", ""Now that their growth plans have changed, we're also changing. We've added sales, they add more and will beef up a marketing program. It's still true that the larger potential clients and the consultants who know them are keenly aware of which issuing processors are capable of handling their potential business. But we still need to make certain that we have a voice at the table in their discussions, so we'll be adding to that. I think for 2024, we'll add to business development expenses, we'll continue with building in our next-generation software, while at the same time, we'll be lowering the headcount areas that are not growing as we had anticipated. By the way, our new platform is now called [Corefinity] (ph), that's the inside name, but we've recently introduced the first output of that effort into our own core processing environment."", ""It's a service that we offer to our customers. Some of the output from the new platform development will go into our current processing environment and some of it will not be available until the second half of next year when we finish it. Let me just -- I guess, just summarize that we're focused on the continued growth of processing and maintenance revenues outside of Goldman. And as I've just mentioned, we're doing that partly with adding some expense in those areas. We do have increased revenue visibility. The Goldman revenues are now longer-term contracted and they're recurring in nature. We do have reduced customer concentration, and that's a bump in the road today towards a healthier customer base going forward. As we continue to grow non-Goldman revenue, that's the measure of the success for the company, I think."", ""Make sure we have a new platform coming on. And then, of course, our cash flow is positive. We have a very strong balance sheet, with no debt. If you look at the bigger picture, card issues globally is strong and continues to grow despite economic conditions. CoreCard gets paid on a number of cards issued. So, even in an economic downturn, we're fad. Our differentiation is simply CoreCard competes on program innovation, customization, flexibility, speed, premium service levels, and while the legacy service providers, they do have skilled advantages, although at some point, I'll talk about that because I think they're not what they appear to be, the aspects that CoreCard offer are highly distinct from the competition, and have driven customer wins in the past, and we think we'll continue to do so."", ""With that, I'll open it for questions if we have any."", 'See also Top 15 Electric Bike Brands According to Reddit and 30 Highest-Grossing Media Franchises of All Time.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will open the lines for your questions and answers. If you should require assistance during this call, please press star then zero. As a reminder, today’s conference will be recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Winnie Smith.

Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call can be found on the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpayments.com. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today’s conference call contain forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the impact of economic conditions on our future operations, that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K and subsequent filings.', 'We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them.

Joining me on the call are Cameron Bready, President and CEO, and Josh Whipple, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO.', 'Now I’ll turn the call over to Cameron.', 'Cameron Bready: Thanks Winnie, and good morning everyone. We were pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, which exceeded our initial expectations outlined last February. I am extremely proud of our teams around the world for their outstanding execution. Together, we accomplished a great deal in 2023. Starting with our financial performance, for the full year we achieved high single digit adjusted net revenue growth and increased adjusted earnings per share 12%. This includes a more than 400 basis point headwind from the divestiture of our Netspend consumer business, which we completed early in the second quarter. We also expanded adjusted operating margins 90 basis points, including the impact of EVO payments, which had a lower margin profile than Global Payments at the time of the acquisition.', 'Importantly, we deliver this performance consistently throughout the year despite ongoing headwinds, including macroeconomic uncertainty, persistent inflation, FX volatility and geopolitical unrest highlighting the durability of our model. Strategically, we also made significant progress during the year executing on a number of key initiatives. First, we successfully closed the acquisition EVO Payments in March, which complements our strategy of providing further penetration into integrated payments, enhancing our B2B capabilities and expanding our exposure to stronger secular growth markets globally. Our integration has progressed quite well and we remain on track to deliver on our revised target of $135 million in annual run rate expense synergies within two years.', 'While revenue synergies generally take longer to materialize, we are more excited today than when we announced the transaction about opportunities we have to cross-sell our products and capabilities into EVO’s existing customer base. We are continuing to invest in these opportunities in 2024 and expect them to scale more fully in 2025. Further, we completed the divestitures of our Netspend consumer assets and our gaming solutions business in April. These three transactions represent important milestones as we seek to advance our strategy and operate a simpler business model centered on our core corporate and financial institution customer base. In our merchant business, that strategy is spearheaded by a software-centric approach leveraging our strengths across our vertical markets, integrated and point-of-sale businesses, and we seek to drive distinction in our offerings by providing omnichannel capabilities and value-added commerce enablement solutions across our markets, including those that benefit from stronger payment digitization and secular growth trends.', 'We continue to see good momentum in our merchant solutions as we execute these strategies. Starting with our vertical markets businesses, we had a number of notable achievements in 2023 across the portfolio. These include Xenial’s new partnerships to be the official commerce technology provider for both the Atlanta Braves and Atlanta Hawks as we look to further expand our market presence in the stadium and event venue vertical. In the United Kingdom, we renewed our relationship with Principality Stadium, home of Welsh rugby and football, and expanded our services with Wembley Stadium in London. We were also selected by leading food service management company, Sodexo, to be its preferred point-of-sale and kiosk partner, and are now the partner of choice for the three largest players in the food service management space.', 'Our education solutions business delivered many new marquee customer additions across our K-12 and our university businesses and continue to expand to international markets with school solutions, launching MySchoolBucks in Australia, and TouchNet achieving new wins in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. Our active network business had a record bookings year, singing 839 new logos, including it largest ever win in the community vertical with the City of Toronto. Moving to partner and software solutions, we achieved record bookings in 2023 with new partners increasing 23% from the prior year. This was in part driven by the strong momentum we have seen with our new progressive payment facilitation, or profac model that we launched midyear.', 'This hybrid option provides many of the benefits of being a payment facilitator while minimizing the heavy burden that comes with it. Profac is unique to Global Payments and we are delighted to have signed 16 profac partners to date who already have thousands of merchant customers using our payment solutions. Some notable new partners in our integrated business include 402 Ventures, a leading provider of auction software in the heavy equipment and machinery vertical; Autosoft, which provides a software management platform for auto dealerships; Black Knight, a leading provider of mortgages and loan origination software; and Inovalon, a leading data analytics ISD in the healthcare vertical. These trends, including the momentum we are seeing with profac underscore our confidence in our ability to maintain consistent growth going forward as our differentiated capabilities continue to resonate with the ISB market.', 'As for the third leg of our software strategy, our point-of-sale software business delivered strong growth for the full year as we continue to see solid demand for our solutions and benefit from the releases of new product enhancements. Notably, our average revenue per unit continues to expand, up 9% year-over-year as more merchants are using payments and other add-on capabilities in our evolving POS platform, and of course this is prior to the full launch of our complete next-generation restaurant and retail point-of-sale software platforms, which we continue to expect this quarter. Lastly, our exposure to some of the most attractive secular markets globally remains a core element of our strategy, both in terms of contributing to our overall rates of growth and providing us the global footprint we need to support complex multi-national corporations.', 'We continue to see good trends across our businesses in Spain and central Europe, each of which delivered high teens growth, and key new European markets entered with EVO, including Poland and Greece, and also achieved double-digit growth. Further, we have seen favorable secular trends in LatAm, where we meaningfully increased our footprint with EVO. This includes new implementations in Mexico with large customers like dLocal, DHL and Petro 7 as we leverage our partnership with City Betamex. Turning to issuer solutions, where we have longstanding relationships with some of the most complex and sophisticated institutions globally, we are proud to have completed 11 customer conversions in 2023. In total, we added over 50 million accounts to our business and ended the year with record traditional accounts on file of more than 800 million.', 'We continue to have a strong pipeline of new business that extends into 2025, as well as eight letters of intent with institutions worldwide. In 2023, we achieved 13 multi-year renewals and new customer agreements. This includes a new contract with a leading U.S. bank that is a longstanding Global Payments merchant partner, a relationship that provided the foundation for the growth of our partnership to include issuer technology solutions. We also continued to expand into new and faster growth markets, including in LatAm through our partnership with CAT, the credit card joint venture between Scotiabank and Chile’s largest retailer, Cencosud. The confidence that many of the largest and most sophisticated complex financial institutions have with us is enhanced by our issuer platform monetization efforts, which positions us to provide our clients market-leading, cloud-native, real-time solutions at scale in more markets than we ever have previously.', 'We have made substantial progress with our modernization with two clients now in production leveraging products via our cloud solution. Further, we expect to complete the development of our client-facing applications this year and are planning to execute dozens of unique cloud-issuer platform pilots spanning multiple services, products and geographies as we prepare for the commercial launch of additional cloud-native capabilities. Moving to B2B, we continue to see solid demand for our leading capabilities across our three focus areas: software-driven work flow automation, money-in and money-out funds flow, and employer solutions. We have successfully integrated EVO’s PayFabric software into our merchant business, allowing us to go to market in B2B acceptance with a software-led approach.', 'Further, our MineralTree business nearly doubled subscription bookings in its core midmarket, positioning the business well heading into 2024. As one of the largest virtual card issuers in the world, we are benefiting from accelerated adoption of virtual cards globally, which contributed to strong growth in commercial transactions this year. Additionally, our B2B bookings in merchant solutions increased over 20% in 2023 as more of this spend shifts towards digital channels. Our employer solutions are also seeing favorable trends, including our payroll business delivering mid-teens growth for the full year and our paycard and EWA solutions achieving nearly 2,000 new partnerships last year. After an eventful and successful 2023, I am pleased to report that we are carrying this momentum into the early part of 2024.', 'In January, our merchant business announced a new joint venture with Commerzbank in Germany. This new entity, Commerz Globalpay, is expected to launch in the first half of 2024 and will deliver a comprehensive suite of innovative omnichannel payments and software offerings, including our GP point-of-sale software solutions and our GP touch on mobile technology at scale, providing merchants the capabilities needed to run and grow their businesses more efficiently in the largest economy in Europe. We are delighted to be partnering with Commerzbank, a premier financial institution with unmatched relationships with small and medium-sized merchants, to significantly enhance distribution in Germany, where there are substantial opportunities to further digitize the payment experience.', 'This partnership was achieved because of Global Payments leadership in payments technology and commerce solutions and extensive JV experience across European markets, while our acquisition of EVO helped provide a foundation with its existing physical presence and merchant portfolio in Germany. In North America, we remain on track to launch our next-generation Heartland restaurant and Heartland retail offerings this quarter, which will provide best-in-class omnichannel experiences and further catalyze our success in point-of-sale software. Early feedback on our next generation restaurant point-of-sale solution has been overwhelmingly positive, including our new updated and enhanced features like online ordering, loyalty, mobile point of sale, and a simplified user interface on commercial-grade hardware.', 'Our new retail POS solution allows us to extend into additional retail verticals, which is the cornerstone of our broader strategy of sub-vertical expansion, allowing us to increase wallet share while meeting the demands of a modern retail environment that brings supply chain, ecommerce, customer engagement and complex ERP functionality into a simplified and single ecosystem. This expansion not only aligns with our growth objectives but also ensures we stay at the forefront of retail technology, providing our clients with the tools they need to thrive in a rapidly evolving market. Our POS momentum also continues in the enterprise QSR space. We were delighted to be selected to power CosMc’s, a new concept from the McDonald’s universe. Xenial’s cloud point-of-sale drive-thru digital menu boards and nVision speed of service solutions are enabling an innovative new drive-thru traffic management system that supports CosMc’s multiple drive-thru lanes and pick-up windows, optimizing restaurant operations in a dynamic and flexible way.', 'CosMc’s is also using Xenial’s back office suite to provide real time reporting and management of inventory, sales, labor, projections and scheduling. We are excited to have already launched with CosMc’s at the initial Bolingbrook, Illinois restaurant concept in December and look forward to helping future-proof all new pilot locations with our cloud-based technology ecosystem as they open in additional markets in 2024. Our issuer business has also started the year well, having executed multi-year renewal agreements with two of our flagship clients, Capital One and Navy Federal Credit Union, both longstanding relationships spanning decades. Our renewal with Capital One include both its consumer and commercial credit portfolios in North America, and for Navy Federal, a not-for-profit credit union serving the military, veterans and their families, our relationship supports its consumer portfolio as well as an array of value-added services, including loyalty, fraud, and digital engagement solutions.', 'The extension of these partnerships further validates our strategy of aligning our business with clear market winners. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the resiliency we have seen in consumer spending and expect fairly similar trends in 2024. However, we recognize there remains a number of risks to the global economy and consumer and are appropriately reflecting this in our expectations. Our outlook does incorporate a slightly more tempered expectation for the macro environment relative to what we experienced in 2023, but is roughly aligned with what we saw exiting the year. January trends were fairly consistent with what you heard from the networks and broadly in line with our expectations. We are confident we have built a better and more durable business model which positions us well to manage through any environment if the current backdrop changes.', 'With that, I’ll turn the call over to Josh.', 'Josh Whipple: Thanks Cameron. We were pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year, which reflects continued outstanding execution and the resiliency of our business model. I’m particularly proud that we delivered these results while simultaneously completing multiple transactions which serve to accelerate our strategy. Starting with the full year 2023, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $8.67 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year. Excluding the impact of dispositions, adjusted net revenue increased 15% compared to 2022. Adjusted operating margin for the full year improved 90 basis points to 44.6%. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $10.42, an increase of 12% compared to the full year 2022, which equates to over 16% growth excluding the impact of dispositions.', 'For the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.19 billion, an increase of 8% from the same period in the prior year. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 30 basis points to 44.8%. This equates to 100 basis points of margin expansion excluding EVO payments and dispositions. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.65, an increase of 10% compared to the same period in 2023. Taking a closer look at performance by segment, merchant solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.67 billion for the fourth quarter, reflecting growth of 19% or approximately 8% excluding the impact of EVO and dispositions. Our performance was led by our software-centric businesses, which again delivered double-digit growth in the quarter.', 'Specifically, we saw strength in Zego, school solutions, and AdvancedMD, which delivered strong double-digit growth for the fourth quarter, and our point-of-sale businesses again grew roughly 20%. Focusing on faster growth geographies, we achieved double-digit growth in Spain and central Europe, as well as in Poland and Greece. Our LatAm business was another bright spot for the quarter as we benefit from the strong secular payments trends in Mexico and Chile. This performance was partially offset by ongoing weakness in the macro environment in the U.K. and Canada. We delivered on adjusted operating margin of 47.7% in the merchant segment, a decline of 60 basis points due to the acquisition of EVO. Excluding EVO and dispositions, operating margins improved 40 basis points year-on-year.', 'For the full year, we realized approximately 25% of our targeted expense synergies from EVO, and as Cameron mentioned, we expect to deliver on our raised expectation of $135 million in annual run rate expense synergies within two years. Our issuer solutions business produced adjusted net revenue of $531 million, reflecting growth of 6% or 5% constant currency growth. The core issuer business also grew mid single digits this quarter, driven by ongoing strength in volume-based revenue. This was partially offset by slower growth in managed and output services as we continue to focus our issuer business on more technology enablement. We added approximately 13 million traditional accounts on file sequentially - this equates to an increase of more than 50 million accounts year-over-year as we continue to benefit from the ongoing execution of our conversion pipeline, in addition to healthy consumer and commercial account growth with our large, existing FI customers.', 'Issuer transactions grew high single digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, led by commercial card transactions which increased low double digits, highlighting ongoing strength in cross-border corporate travel. Focusing in on our issuer B2B portfolio, MineralTree delivered high teens growth and achieved record bookings this quarter in its targeted midmarket segment, while pay card saw improving trends as the business lapped the more difficult employment comparisons from the last year. Finally, issuer solutions delivered an adjusted operating margin of 47.3%. As expected, this was relatively consistent with our third quarter performance but represented a decline compared to the prior year, due to a difficult comparison resulting from vendor benefits reflected in that period.', 'For the full year, our issuer margins expanded 100 basis points, which exceeded our initial guidance for 60 basis points of margin improvement compared to 2022. From a cash flow standpoint, we produced strong adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of $784 million and $2.5 billion for the year. This represents an approximately 100% conversion rate of adjusted net income to adjusted free cash flow for the full year, consistent with our expectations excluding the impact of the requirement to capitalize research and development costs for income tax reporting purposes. Capital investment was approximately $157 million in the fourth quarter and roughly $660 million for the full year. Since closing EVO in March, we have reduced outstanding debt by more than $1.4 billion and our leverage position was 3.4 times at the end of the fourth quarter.', 'Our balance sheet remains healthy and we have approximately $3.5 billion of available liquidity. Further, our total indebtedness is approximately 91% fixed, with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.78%. While debt repayment was our top priority for capital allocation in 2023, we are pleased to have also repurchased 4 million shares for roughly $410 million prior to closing EVO. Turning to the outlook, we are pleased with how our business is positioned as we enter 2024. We currently expect reported adjusted net revenue to range from $9.17 billion to $9.30 billion, reflecting growth of 6% to 7% over 2023 or approximately 7%-plus excluding EVO and dispositions. We are forecasting annual adjusted operating margin to expand up to 50 basis points for 2024, driven by benefits to our business mix from our ongoing shift towards technology enablement, partially offset by the lower margin profile of EVO prior to full synergy realization.', 'To provide color at the segment level, we expect our merchant business to report adjusted net revenue growth of 9%-plus for the full year. This includes growth in the 7% to 8% range excluding the impact of the acquisition of EVO and the disposition of gaming solutions. We will fully annualize the transactions by the end of the first quarter of 2024. We expect up to 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the merchant business in 2024 with a slower expansion in the first half relative to the second half as EVO synergy realization ramps as the year progresses. Moving to issuer solutions, we are anticipating adjusted net revenue growth in the 5% to 6% range for the full year compared to 2023, as we benefit from our strong conversion pipeline and continued account growth with our large existing FI partners.', 'We expect core issuer to grow in the mid single digit range and for MineralTree and Netspend’s B2B businesses to grow low double digits. We anticipate adjusted operating margin for the issuer business to expand by up to 50 basis points as we continue to drive efficiencies in the business, which will be offset somewhat by faster growth in our lower margin B2B businesses. In terms of quarterly phasing, as I mentioned, we will anniversary the acquisition of EVO and the disposition of gaming by the end of the first quarter. We will also anniversary the impact of the divestiture of Netspend’s consumer assets at the end of April. As a result, we will continue to have some impacts from these transactions in the first half of the year. Moving to a couple non-operating items, we currently expect net interest expense to be slightly above $500 million this year and for our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.', 'We also are planning for our capital expenditures to be around $670 million in 2024, which remains roughly 7% of revenue. We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to again be in a comparable range of 100%, excluding the roughly five-point impact from the timing change for recognizing research and development tax credits. Regarding capital allocation, we plan to return to a more balanced capital allocation approach in 2024, and I’m delighted that our board of directors has approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $2 billion, as share buyback remains one of our priorities. We also plan to further reduce our indebtedness until we return to roughly three times levered on a net debt basis during the year. Putting it all together, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $11.54 to $11.70, reflecting growth of 11% to 12% over 2023.', 'Excluding dispositions, adjusted earnings per share growth is expected to be 14%-plus for 2024. Our outlook for the year reflects the ongoing positive momentum in our business. While accommodating for a more tempered economic environment, given the continued uncertainty, we remain confident in the resiliency of our model and our ability to adapt to potential shifts in the economic environment. Cameron?', 'Cameron Bready: Thanks Josh. As I said when I was named CEO in May, it’s an exciting time for Global Payments, and I could not be more proud of all we accomplished last year. As we begin 2024, I remain enthusiastic about the opportunities in front of us. We have a compelling technology-enabled strategy, a world-class team, great partners and clients, and a global presence with diverse distribution capabilities. This year, I remain highly focused on the priorities for our business and customers I outlined at the time I stepped into this role. First, we will continue to execute against our strategies, which positions us well for growth and success across our markets. We will, however, sharpen our focus on the most attractive opportunities we see in these areas while seeking to further simplify our business and amplify the impact of our investments.', 'Specifically, we are focusing on the most impactful of these initiatives and where we can drive further differentiation in our business, including with our software-centric channels across our own, partnered and POS solutions. Additionally, we will continue to harmonize areas of the business that are less differentiated with an eye towards further improving scale and enhancing margin characteristics. Further, in markets and businesses where we are subscale with limited potential to build scale, we may choose to exit certain lines of business and activities in order to better focus our investments, resources and management intention on opportunities with better long term growth prospects that can more meaningfully impact our business. Second, I am focused on making it as easy as possible to do business with Global Payments while providing more solutions that deepen our relationships with our customers.', 'We will continue to prioritize meeting our clients and customers how and where they want to be met with innovative and distinctive capabilities that integrate seamlessly. This includes our issuer modernization program and cloud investments, which will provide our clients with greater enablement capabilities and allow them to consume the services they need with greater speed to market and flexibility while providing best-in-class experiences for their cardholders. Third, we will maintain our relentless focus on execution, which has been one of the hallmarks of Global Payments and a key component of our ability to produce consistent results through market cycles. We are, however, undertaking an initiative to further simplify our technology and operating environments across the globe to become more efficient and effective, placing greater focus on aligning with business outcomes.', 'We are committed to redefining success with a continuous improvement mindset and increasing the speed of delivery and nimbleness of our business. Fourth, we remain committed to harnessing the power of generative AI to both innovate new products and solutions that deliver value and improved experiences to our customers, and increase the productivity and efficiency of our operating environments and workforce around the globe. We have already made meaningful progress in our journey to embed generative AI into our business to leverage its power and the richness of its data in our ecosystem. We have established a center of excellence to coordinate our adoption of generative AI technologies and provide a governance framework, implemented foundational tools and models that are being utilized throughout our organization, evaluating numerous use cases and deployed generative AI technology in a number of areas of our business.', 'For example, in our issuer solutions business, our Foresight solution in partnership with Featurespace provider a market-leading fraud solution that uses generative AI to detect fraud strategies in real time utilizing our proprietary data. Clients using this solution have realized a nearly 50% reduction in fraud losses, and we are evaluating a number of development opportunities that use generative AI across our issuing and acquiring businesses as a key component of our next-generation applications to further combat fraud and identity risk across our portfolios. Finally, I’m focused on ensuring Global Payments’ culture is second to none. Our culture dictates how we accomplish our goals and achieve results as an organization. Having a world-class culture will further differentiate us in the marketplace while driving value creation and benefit for all of our constituents.', 'Winnie?', 'Winnie Smith: Thanks Cameron. Before we begin our question and answer session, I’d like to ask everyone to limit their questions to one with one follow-up to accommodate everyone in the queue. Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions.', 'See also 35 Biggest Football Clubs in the World and 20 Most Meat Eating States Per Capita.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Cafaro, Chairman and CEO of Ventas."", 'Debra A. Cafaro', ""Thank you, BJ. I want to welcome all of our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. I'm pleased to share our strong results for 2023, discuss our advantaged position across commercial real estate, driven by large and growing demographic demand and introduce full year 2024 guidance as the senior housing multiyear growth opportunity continues to power our expectations.Let's start with results. We reported favorable results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. We produced full year normalized FFO of $2.99 per share, representing over 5% year-over-year growth, above the midpoint of the guidance range we initiated in February. As anticipated, our results were fueled by unprecedented organic property growth in our SHOP portfolio, which grew same-store cash NOI over 18% last year.Enterprise same-store cash NOI growth was supported by compounding contributions from our outpatient medical and research and triple net lease portfolios. We finished the year on a high note in the fourth quarter, delivering $0.76 of normalized FFO, representing 7% year-over-year growth and reporting accelerating same-store SHOP occupancy.During 2023, the Ventas team accomplished a great deal together. We raised over $4 billion in attractively priced capital, took effective portfolio actions, invested CapEx in our assets to position our portfolio to capture demand in strong markets, made meaningful progress toward our ambitious ESG goals, successfully integrated a $1.6 billion portfolio and expanded our VIM business.As a result, we delivered over 15% 1-year total return to shareholders, posted 2 years in a row of TSR outperformance versus the health care REIT and broader REIT indices and achieved upper quartile performance for the last 3 years among health care REITs. We still have more work to do. We are focused on driving total returns for our shareholders. As durable demand fuels the multiyear growth opportunity in senior housing, we believe Ventas offers an attractive combination of growth and value.Let me provide a few reasons we believe we are uniquely positioned to create value. We entered 2024 with momentum. Because our asset classes are benefiting from demographic demand that is strong and getting stronger, we are pleased to project another consecutive year of normalized FFO growth in the mid-single digits and the third consecutive year of same-store SHOP cash NOI growth in the double digits. Notably, our projected 2024 normalized FFO growth of 5% per share puts us in the top 20% of all REITs that have issued guidance to date.In 2024, we expect to benefit from steady growth from our outpatient medical research and triple net lease portfolios. As we look into 2025, we have 2 large lease renewals, one with Brookdale in senior housing and another with Kindred for a portion of our LTACs. In Brookdale's case, our communities are enjoying positive operating trends, and they have significant net absorption potential. In Kindred's situation, rent coverage remains challenged, and it's too early to say what the ultimate outcome in 2025 will be. Kindred remains focused on performance improvements that could benefit 2024 and 2025 financial results. In all cases, we are fully prepared to maximize NOI over time.In SHOP, January is already starting positively, with 200 basis points in year-over-year same-store occupancy growth. In 2024, we expect year-over-year normalized FFO and SHOP same-store cash NOI growth to accelerate in the second half, with a SHOP NOI exit run rate that should support continued SHOP growth in 2025 and beyond. This highly positive context is supportive of growing our senior housing presence through both organic and inorganic growth.In pursuit of delivering consistent superior performance, our strategy is to, one, continue to deliver compelling profitable organic growth in senior housing; two, capture value-creating external growth focused on senior housing; and three, drive strong execution and cash flow generation throughout our high-quality portfolio that serves a large and growing aging demographic.Our optimism for a long, durable growth opportunity in SHOP is founded on compelling supply/demand dynamics, led by a step function in growth of the over-80 population in 2024 and yet again in 2027, the lowest construction starts in senior housing since 2009 and our advantaged platform that has the team, tools, financial strength, data and operators to drive organic performance. The Ventas platform should also enable us to invest successfully.As we discussed in November, we intend to build on our compelling organic growth opportunity by layering on value-creating external investments focused on senior housing. There is a confluence of market factors giving us confidence that 2024 and 2025 should be rich with investment opportunities. We're already seeing our pipeline expand as high-quality senior housing communities in good markets with embedded growth come to market, and we have a line of sight to complete over $300 million of investments in the first half of this year.Our criteria for investments include attractive going-in yields priced at below replacement costs with projected low to mid-teens unlevered IRRs that meet our right market, right asset, right operator framework. Our broader objectives are to drive enterprise NOI and normalized FFO per share growth, increase the scale of our SHOP business, deliver strong returns on capital, support stable and growing dividend capacity and maximize value for shareholders.In sum, we delivered on our commitments in 2023, and we expect another year of normalized FFO per share and property performance growth in 2024. Our 5% projected normalized FFO growth favorably distinguishes Ventas across the REIT universe. With an attractive valuation and the growth engine of senior housing, we are focused on enabling exceptional environments for a large and growing aging population and creating value for our shareholders.Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Justin."", 'J. Justin Hutchens', ""Thank you, Debbie. I'm pleased to say our SHOP portfolio delivered double-digit same-store cash NOI growth for the sixth quarter in a row. The same-store NOI growth for the year was led by our U.S. communities with 24.5% growth complemented by our high-quality Canadian portfolio, which is over 95% occupied and continues to deliver a valuable and stable cash flow. Total SHOP same-store cash NOI growth was 18.3%, which was above same-store guidance midpoint expectations. We are happy with this attractive growth and strong finish to the year.Double clicking on the year, the results were good. Our same-store SHOP communities outperformed our expectations across all key metrics, including occupancy, REVPOR, OpEx and margin expansion. Full year same-store SHOP occupancy grew by 120 basis points. The U.S. saw 140 basis points of occupancy gains, and Canada, although already highly occupied, grew by 90 basis points. Demand strength across geographies and asset types led to accelerating occupancy growth this quarter, with 170 basis points of year-over-year growth.Furthermore, we saw 110 basis points of average sequential occupancy growth from the third quarter to the fourth. U.S. SHOP occupancy growth was supported primarily by strong demand, with move-ins that were 109% of prior year levels in the fourth quarter. REVPOR grew over 6% for the year. contributing to revenue growth of almost 8%. As a reminder, REVPOR would have been 40 basis points higher in 2023 and 130 basis points on the fourth quarter if adjusted for the Sunrise special assessment that occurred in 2022. OpExPOR performed well and was led by the U.S. with 2% growth year-over-year and 2.6% overall.Looking forward to 2024, we are excited to continue on our multiyear growth trajectory as we are expecting our third consecutive year of double-digit NOI growth in our same-store SHOP portfolio. Momentum ramped at the end of 2023, with fourth quarter occupancy accelerating, while strong pricing and higher move-ins fuel better than typical seasonal results and help 2024 to get off to a strong start.Once again, we are expecting the U.S. to be the growth engine with continued accelerating occupancy performance, with over 300 basis points growth, and expected to drive NOI growth in the mid- to high teens year-over-year. The overall SHOP portfolio is expected to grow NOI 10%, 15%. The growing demand at our doorstep continues to support strong price and volume growth and serves a testament to the high quality and care and services and value proposition our communities provide to seniors and their families. The key assumptions that drive the midpoint of our range are average occupancy growth of about 250 basis points, REVPOR growth of about 5%, which puts the total revenue growth around 8%.January occupancy is already off to a strong start, delivering 200 basis points of occupancy growth year-over-year. This performance demonstrates solid execution by our operators and continued demand. We expect the performance throughout the year to be bolstered by newly renovated properties and Ventas OI initiatives to drive a strong key selling season. 2024 OpExPOR is expected to grow in line with normal inflation.We structured our business around rate growth and occupancy growth. We are entering the sweet spot where price and occupancy are moving together to drive revenue. Margin expansion will follow as higher occupancy creates operating leverage. We have struck a balance where they are moving together, and we anticipate further margin expansion over time as higher occupancy creates operating leverage. We are capitalizing our active asset management playbook and our operators' execution, which delivered strong momentum to finish 2023 and will propel us into 2024.We expect this to build sequentially throughout the year, which means we are poised for strong year-end NOI that should propel us even further in 2025 and beyond. We are delivering on the organic senior housing growth, which is the part 1 of our strategy and my #1 priority. Part 2 is expanding our footprint. In addition to the success we are having in our existing portfolio, we look forward to capturing value-creating external growth focused on senior housing. A key tenet of our investment strategy is our right market, right asset, right operator approach. We're bringing OI tools to investment activities to help the selection process.Our top investment priorities continue to be NOI-generating CapEx in our existing real estate and senior housing acquisitions. Sellers are motivated to transact, creating numerous actionable deals. We are targeting opportunities with low to mid-teen unlevered IRRs. We seek senior housing communities that are located in submarkets with compelling supply-demand profile, strong affordability and meaningful expected net absorption projections.We are primarily expanding with existing partners with proven performance for Ventas, and plan to increase our footprint in the fast-growing IL, AL memory care combination communities. Our pipeline is growing, as we have several interesting potential investments in our sites. Our team is actively working on transactions exceeding 300 million that meet our criteria, and I look forward to adding to that as the year progresses.In summary, demand is at our doorstep. We are pleased to see the SHOP growth engine continue to be led by the U.S. and complemented by the low beta, high quality and highly valuable Canada portfolio with compounding growth. 2024 is rich with opportunities through organic growth and external acquisitions. The growth on both fronts throughout the year should support value creation in 2025 and beyond. I'm looking forward to the exciting year ahead. Bob?"", 'Robert F. Probst', ""Thank you, Justin. I'm going to share some highlights on our '23 performance, touch on our balance sheet and close with our 2024 outlook. I'll start by saying we are pleased with all we accomplished in 2023. We finished the year strong, with reported normalized FFO per share of $0.76 in the fourth quarter, a 7% increase versus the prior year, adjusting for the promote received in Q4 of '22. For the fiscal year '23, we delivered normalized FFO of $2.99 per share or over 5% growth year-over-year when adjusting the prior year for unusual items.The multiyear senior housing growth trajectory was in full display in '23, with SHOP total NOI increasing year-over-year by approximately $100 million. We also reported total company same-store cash NOI growth of over 8% year-over-year, which is one of the fastest organic growth rates in our company's history. Our 2023 normalized FFO of $2.99 per share was at the high end of our previous $2.96 to $2.99 guidance range, and included $0.01 per share cybersecurity revenue impact in the fourth quarter in our Ardent OpCo investment that was not contemplated in prior guidance.Pete Bulgarelli and our outpatient medical and research team delivered another year of continuous compounding growth, with same-store cash NOI increasing nearly 3% in 2023, at the high end of our guidance range. Continued strong retention and leasing activity in outpatient medical led the way. A key driver of that result is the remarkable record of tenant satisfaction in Ventas' Lillibridge property management business, which notched its fourth consecutive year of top quartile tenant satisfaction. In 2023, Lillibridge reached the 97th percentile for overall tenant satisfaction, placing it among the top 5 property managers.I'd also like to share a few comments on our balance sheet. Throughout 2023, we used our scale and access to diverse sources of capital, raised over $4 million of attractively-priced capital across multiple markets and geographies. This capital raising in 2023 in part refunded 2024 maturing debt at attractive rates. As a result, we had a robust year-end 2023 liquidity position of $3.2 billion and have relatively modest 2024 maturing debt of $800 million net of cash on hand. The attractive NOI and EBITDA growth in our SHOP business also improved Ventas' net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 6.9x in the fourth quarter, a trend we expect to continue in 2024 and beyond led by the multiyear SHOP NOI growth opportunity.Let's conclude with our full year 2024 outlook. Because our asset classes are benefiting from powerful demographic demand, we are pleased to project another consecutive year of normalized FFO growth in the mid-single digits, and the third consecutive year of same-store SHOP cash NOI growth in the double digits. For 2024, we expect net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.06 per share at the midpoint. Our 2024 normalized FFO guidance range is $3.07 to $3.18 or $3.13 per share at the midpoint, which represents 5% year-over-year growth.The $0.14 FFO per share increase year-over-year can be bridged by 3 items. We expect a $0.28 per share contribution from outstanding year-over-year property growth led again by SHOP, which is expected to grow NOI by over $100 million for the second consecutive year. This property growth is partially offset by an $0.11 per share increase in higher interest expense and the $0.03 impact of 2023 capital recycling. In terms of same-store, we expect our total company same-store cash NOI to grow between 5% and 7.5% in 2024 led by SHOP same-store cash NOI growth of 10% to 15%.Our guidance also includes new senior housing investments of 350 million, which Justin mentioned in his remarks. The low and high end of our FFO guidance range are largely described by our property NOI expectations and potential changes in interest rates. A final note on phasing. We expect same-store cash NOI and normalized FFO year-over-year growth to ramp through the year, driven by higher interest expense in the first half of '24 versus '23, and the occupancy acceleration in the key selling season in SHOP, resulting in an exit run rate that should enable attractive SHOP growth '25 and beyond.A more fulsome discussion of our '24 guidance assumptions can be found in the earnings and outlook presentation posted to our website. To close, the entire Ventas team is ready to win together with all of our stakeholders. And that concludes our prepared remarks. (Operator Instructions)With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Michael Albert Carroll', ""Debbie, can you provide some additional color on your Kindred lease? I know in the business update Ventas has highlighted, Kindred has implemented some improvement -- or performance improvement initiatives, and you also highlighted that Select Medical had some really strong EBITDAR growth in 2Q and 3Q of '23. I mean are you implying that Kindred can grow into this coverage ratio? Or is that just kind of data points highlighting that there is some improvement in that coverage that could occur over the next handful of quarters?"", 'Debra A. Cafaro', ""Right. Mike, I would tell you that obviously, the most important thing we think about in the renewal in 2025 is about what the earnings capacity of those assets is at that time and beyond. And the -- Kindred has communicated to us that they have significant initiatives underway on those revenue and expense to improve operating performance incentives.Some of those, we can see are starting to take hold. We give Select as an example because it's a public company in the same business, and it shows that significant improvements are possible. And it's really too early to say, whether and to the extent Kindred's initiatives will, in fact, take hold to improve EBITDAR in 2024 and 2025. But they are surely working on it."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.', 'Nicholas Philip Yulico', ""Maybe just a question on the guidance for Bob. In terms of the interest expense going up this year, is there anything you can just sort of give us there in terms of some of the assumptions on refinancing? I wasn't also sure if you're assuming any change in leverage in terms of debt reduction, but perhaps you could just unpack that a little bit more."", 'Robert F. Probst', ""Sure, Nick. Yes. So I mentioned the $0.11 year-over-year. A big piece of that is refinancing our debt into a higher rate environment. We have $1.2 billion of debt coming due this year, and you call it in the mid-3s kind of range from having issued that debt quite -- years ago. So refinancing that in the current environment is dilutive.The volume of debt also, we have a year-over-year impact of the ELP transaction midyear last year, so we have effectively, the first half of that, that we're lapping in '24. So together, those 2 things describe the increase year-on-year on interest expense. I'd note we've included interest expense guidance, which is new to us, in order to try to help analysts' model that because I know it can be tricky, but those are the drivers."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush.', 'Richard Charles Anderson', ""Speaking of Kindred, but also Brookdale and Santerre process, if I can call it that. What are the chances that there could be some activity in 2024 to sort of reset the situation in that -- those portfolios, such that maybe there will be a temporary drag to deal with this year, so that when 2025 does come around, you've kind of addressed that and you won't have sort of this other issue to deal with in 2025, sort of make next year more of a cleaner picture. Are you thinking that you could do some -- have some activity this year preemptively on any one of those 3 buckets?"", 'J. Justin Hutchens', ""Rich, it's Justin. Let me start with Brookdale. So Brookdale has the opportunity to extend the lease at the end of this year, to let us know, and then the lease will run through the end of '25, and we have a new lease starting in '26. That portfolio is performing well. As I said, continued improvement, has good coverage, is growing coverage and resides in markets that we think have around 1,000 basis points of upside over the next few years. So we're in a strong position there. We'll see how that plays out, but it's a good situation."", 'Richard Charles Anderson', ""The Santerre situation, understanding you're kind of working through, but maybe there's some incremental work that has yet to be done. There's asset sales, there's things that you don't want long term. I'm just curious if there could be some preemptive work there as well?"", 'Debra A. Cafaro', ""Yes. I mean, as you know, kind of Santerre's gotten off to a favorable start, and we are -- we've already sold some assets at favorable pricing. I think we'll continue to pick our spots and be opportunistic on that.And then in terms of Kindred, I think we'd be able to certainly say that we'll have more visibility this year, whether or not the financial impact of this year or next year. Right now, we're thinking about next year. But that -- it's too early to say, really, what form that would take, but we have the benefit of a lease that runs into May of 2025, and that's a valuable asset."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jim Kammert with Evercore ISI.', 'James Hall Kammert', ""Kind of just building actually on Rich's question. In a hypothetical, if Kindred were to not extend come this May, what would the process be and how much has Ventas investigated sort of alternative operators? And what maybe cost might be associated with that, or any transitional worries that might arise as you kind of shift the portfolio again? Hypothetical, just trying to better understand."", 'Debra A. Cafaro', ""Jim, yes, it's kind of funny to be talking about this 25 years after I started, because this is what I was doing 25 years ago. But look, we are really well prepared. We're experienced on this. We have lots of plans and subplans, I would say. It's only really 23 assets in total, so I think that, that makes it kind of manageable.And of course, we will try to optimize the NOI of the assets. And it's a puzzle, and we have lots of tools that we've used before, and that's really what we're focused on. And I can assure you there are -- will always be kind of alternatives that we have and are ready to execute in this scenario."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citigroup.', 'Nicholas Gregory Joseph', ""It's Nick Joseph here with Michael. Just on the acquisition opportunities that you're seeing, you mentioned mid-teens IRRs, but just curious what the going-in yields are. I'm sure it's a range, but just kind of what you're thinking there? What the discount to replacement costs you're seeing on opportunities is? And then just what the funding plans would be for any external growth in 2024?"", 'J. Justin Hutchens', ""It's Justin. I'll start with the first part. We are seeing good opportunities in senior housing. We do target opportunities that have a discount to replacement costs. We're seeing around 20% to 30% discounts in the pipeline. In terms of return expectations, you mentioned the low to mid-teens in unlevered IRRs.We also -- obviously, there is -- the cap rate is a component of that. We tend to see around 7% right now, and there's a little bit of movement up and down, depending on the growth of the asset. So the goal is to be neutral or accretive year 1 and then have growth in the asset, which is supported by this strong and growing demand in the senior housing sector."", 'Robert F. Probst', ""And maybe I'll touch on the funding question. Given those returns, Nick, we think that can be an attractive proposition for shareholders. And indeed, we've built into our guidance about $350 million of investments and on balance sheet financing in order to do that. And we think we can achieve both attractive investment alternatives and delevering in the process with those types of investments."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Juan Carlos Sanabria', ""Just a question on, I guess, the other line items below kind of interest expense. Anything unusual between '23 or '24 or any changes, I should say, that we should be thinking about? I think about some of the Brookdale noncash amortization that's running through the numbers that presumably goes away on that lease, the initial lease, matures, correct me if I'm wrong.But just trying to see if there's any kind of unusual items from the fourth quarter of '23 that maybe you're skewing results relative to expectations from the Street. And if you wouldn't mind commenting on expectations on FAD. You gave normalized FFO, but any piece parts on the FAD would be great as well."", 'Robert F. Probst', ""Sure. So in terms of, as you say, below the line items, first thing to say is the guidance doesn't assume any changes in the '25 lease situation. And so it's business as usual in '24 in our guidance assumptions.You're correct to say there is Brookdale amortization from the consideration we received in that restructure a number of years ago being amortized. If and to the extent we have a restructured deal there, that would be affected, but ultimately, it could be an outcome that depends on the deal itself. In terms of FAD, I would say FAD growth -- this is operating FAD, I would expect to grow in line with FFO year-over-year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.', 'Joshua Dennerlein', ""I was just looking at the presentation you put out, and I saw on Slide 40, it looks like there's a footnote related to class action litigation in your SHOP segment. Can you go over just what that's related to?"", 'Debra A. Cafaro', 'Josh, sure.', 'J. Justin Hutchens', ""Yes, it's Justin. So -- the -- it's an issue in California, and the adjustment relates primarily to the class action suit, involves some of our SHOP properties. We don't really view suits like this to be as ordinary course in our business. They do come up from time to time, especially in California. Because they don't relate to the core business performance, we think adjustment to the FFO is appropriate."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.', 'Michael William Mueller', ""Looking at the SHOP occupancy guide for this year. Can you just talk a little bit about the, I guess, the cadence of occupancy? Does it assume more of a normal year for sort of seasonality? Or how does it compare to what you experienced in '23?"", 'J. Justin Hutchens', ""It's Justin. So great question. I appreciate it. There's a Page 8 in the deck for anyone that has that in front of them. It helps to articulate this. So we had 120 basis points of occupancy growth year-over-year in 2023. We had acceleration of move-ins and occupancy in the third quarter, which led to solid growth in the fourth quarter, which was at 170 basis points year-over-year in January.We're already starting at 200 basis points of occupancy year-over-year, and we are seeing better than typical seasonal results ending the fourth quarter and starting the year so far, which is really encouraging and supportive of the 250 basis points at the midpoint that we included in our SHOP guidance.So we have a good run of occupancy growth, and also, move-ins have been really strong as well. I mentioned that they're around 110% versus prior year in the fourth quarter. We've continued to see a strong move-ins at the beginning of the year as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Michael Stroyeck with Green Street.', 'Michael Lee Stroyeck', ""So going back to Kindred, and I'll try to ask this in a slightly different way. I know it's too early to say what the ultimate outcome will be, but hypothetically, if you did go down this path, as of today, what magnitude of rent reductions do you believe will be required in the near future in order to return those rents to a sustainable level, either for Kindred or the next operator assuming operations on those properties?"", 'Debra A. Cafaro', ""Michael, remember, we own the assets and we own the EBITDAR in those assets. And that's an important -- that's very important. And again, it's too early to say. We have favorable trends in the Brookdale situation, and in Kindred, we hope to have favorable trends as you look out to 2025. So there's a lot more that goes into it when you think about what the outcome is going to be, and we'll be happy to share more with you as the facts develop."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky with Wells Fargo.', 'Connor Serge Siversky', ""I want to jump back to a conversation on the Q2 '23 earnings call in regard to the equitized loan portfolio, specifically the outpatient medical assets. You outlined that you were going to put in place a capital improvement plan to bring occupancy back into those assets.So I'm wondering, at this time, if you could quantify what that capital improvement plan looks like, what occupancy expectations are for those outpatient medical assets, and then what a return profile could look like for that capital improvement plan?"", 'Debra A. Cafaro', ""I mean I think the key point, the topic sentence, and we'll get to the answer is, those assets overlap with our own portfolio in many respects. Our portfolio is over 90% occupied and managed by Pete and the team very effectively. This was under 80%. So there was -- there is and was significant occupancy upside as we get in there and self-manage those assets. And now I'll turn it over to the team to take your questions."", 'Peter J. Bulgarelli', ""Yes. Thanks, Connor. This is Pete. Yes, we're excited for the ELP portfolio. It gives us, I think, over the long haul, upside. We've been extremely active in absorbing that portfolio and renewing that portfolio. We've transitioned 44 of our locations to Lillibridge management using the Lillibridge playbook. We've surveyed all the tenants. We have specific asset plans for each of the buildings. And we're really happy with the results so far. We have increased occupancy by about 1%, and we're also well above plan in our underwriting.So as it relates to how we look forward on this portfolio, we expect in '24 to have about a 3% increase in occupancy. And so we're very happy about that. And I wouldn't -- we will do some upgrades in the common areas and so forth. And you've seen some of the ICE capital in the supplemental here. We'll do a bit more of that. And we'll have kind of normal as-you-go tenant improvements and commissions. So I don't expect anything extraordinary out of the capital being used for that -- for the ELP portfolio."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho.', 'Vikram L. Malhotra', ""Just 2 quick, I guess, senior housing questions, if you can indulge me. First, just the comments about exit into '24 looking better, or I guess, acceleration. I'm wondering kind of what gives you that confidence, because I may be wrong, but I think the occupancy comp will get harder and the expense comp also gets harder. So I'm just wondering what gives you the confidence of acceleration, number one.And just number two, on senior housing. You guys had a great investment in Canada a while ago through the Maurice investment. I'm just wondering, though, the portfolio is now generating like 4% same-store arguably into next year. Is there an opportunity in your minds to recycle that into, say, maybe a U.S. asset where you could get higher growth?"", 'J. Justin Hutchens', ""It's Justin. So let me start with the jumping off point at the end of the year. So what's happening this year is we have significant occupancy growth in our plan. Occupancy, as you know, a lot of it comes from the key selling season. We're off to a pretty good start because we're already outperforming just typical seasonality. But what's most important is what's coming next, which is that kind of May to September period, which provides occupancy growth.Typically, we see the numbers that the demand is there, we see in the underlying performance that we're executing on the demand. So that gives us the confidence that we'll be able to grow occupancy. And then when you have the build during the year, clearly, that you end up ending the year at a higher NOI. And that NOI, the point we're making is it's a good launching pad for 2025 growth when you run that through and then you start adding more occupancy on top of that.The other thing that happens is margin expansion. We're in a place right now, we're in the -- you mentioned Canada. It's 95% occupied. U.S. is around 80%, 81%. Well a lot -- most of our occupancy growth is in the U.S. And when you -- we're just at the early stage of that occupancy band where margin starts to grow, and we're at an inflection point, and so we're also looking forward to next year as well as we -- as occupancy grows, the operating leverage goes up, margin expansion could or should be more in '25.So we think there's good support for this growth, and we're executing, and it's not -- it should help the '25 number, and then the demand is such that the runway should be even longer. So we like what we're seeing there. In terms of Canada, we do have a really, really good portfolio there. And I'm really glad you asked about it because it is a core light asset, very high quality physically.It's very high quality in terms of execution, in occupancy and margin. It's been a consistent performer for us. There's good demand in these markets. It's a great operator. Primarily most of the NOI is Le Groupe Maurice in Canada. And we look forward to continuing with that, and with that relationship and the compounding growth that it can offer and also opportunities to expand that footprint over time."", 'Debra A. Cafaro', 'And also, as we do new investments, obviously, the percentage that, that represents of the overall SHOP portfolio and Ventas will shrink because the denominator will be growing and emphasized on U.S. senior housing. So that will change the impact as well.', 'J. Justin Hutchens', ""Yes. And actually, I'll take this opportunity to make one of my other favorite points. And that is that the U.S., okay, that grew 24.5% in -- for us last year in our same-store pool, and we're expecting mid- to high teens NOI growth in '24. That's the growth engine.And that's comparable to the other portfolio. They have similar upside and less stability, where Canada is what it is. It's high quality and stable. But when you blend the 2, obviously, it hampers our growth a little bit, and it's being hampered by a very high-quality, high-performing portfolio, and the U.S. is growing as well as anyone."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.', 'Austin Todd Wurschmidt', ""Great. It sounds like Kindred's a no-go here, but at least after all these years, I guess it's only 5% of NOI for this master lease and not 50% plus. So, Debbie..."", 'Debra A. Cafaro', ""'99."", 'Austin Todd Wurschmidt', ""That's even before my time. But you did highlight -- I want to hit on the acquisition piece a little bit. And you highlighted $300 million of investments you have confidence in completing in the first half of this year. And there's a chance it sounds like maybe that could increase, given the target-rich environment that you kind of laid out.I guess can you or Bob discuss about the funding plans for those assets and maybe where equity fits into the plan? And I'm just curious, given that line of sight, why not issue under the ATM late last year given kind of the favorable move in the stock and more attractive cost of capital you had?"", 'Debra A. Cafaro', 'Well stated. I think, Bob, Bob, do you want to talk about funding?', 'Robert F. Probst', ""Yes. As I mentioned earlier, look, the returns on these investments that we're seeing make this attractive from day 1 to our shareholders in our view, even at the current cost of capital when you look at the numbers. And we started this discussion with investors really late last year at NAREIT where cap rates have changed. And I think the consensus view at that point continues to be that's a good investment.And so effectively, we've built that into our guidance in this $350 million. And I mentioned the opportunity of over-equitizing alongside that, that is also assumed. That being said, in a very disciplined way. And I think that's the important part of the narrative. And so there is some -- there are assumptions around that, but we will be very prudent in all, always, a function of the market."", 'Debra A. Cafaro', ""And I'm glad you asked it, too, because I think with Ventas really giving FFO guidance into '24, that really is in the top 10 of all REITs, that we are aiming to have an improved multiple that benefits and reward shareholders, and it represents a cost of capital that could be very effective as we build on the organic growth story and layer on attractive investments focused on senior housing."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.', 'Ronald Kamdem', ""Just a 2-parter for me. Just was looking through the deck. One, I realize that the slide on the NOI recovery opportunity, it looks like you guys removed it, which was a pretty helpful slide. So I guess the question #1 would be that conviction of getting back to $1 billion. Presumably the occupancy still feels pretty good with the guidance, but has anything changed about either the views on the margins or the occupancy and the recovery story to sort of pull that slide?And then question #2, sort of part 2, is really, it's a sources and uses question because I don't see the redevelopment CapEx or the asset dispositions guidance that you guys provided last time. So could you be a little bit more specific? We know you're going to do $300 million plus or minus of acquisitions, but maybe a little bit more specificity about how you're thinking about redevelopment CapEx, dispositions and even an equity issuance."", 'Debra A. Cafaro', ""I liked that Slide, too, but I'll give it to Justin to answer."", 'J. Justin Hutchens', ""Yes. I like it. But what really dawned on us, quite frankly, is it's not high enough. It really is -- we're focused on 80% occupancy and getting back to prepandemic cash flows, and we're kind of moving beyond that because we see the ceiling can be a lot higher and the demand backdrop supports that. So we don't want to put a ceiling on the opportunity. We think it's more over time.We've got a good run rate established. We're putting up $100 million -- around $100 million a little bit more per year in the SHOP portfolio. So we decided to move on, try to focus on looking forward. One of the things that, before I'll hand over to Bob, I just want to mention on the -- you mentioned CapEx projects. I just want to throw in something on the senior housing.We did complete 167 projects by the end of '23, and that those started in October of '22. And so we had a really strong run of getting our portfolio refreshed. We think there's about another 70 that completes by this May for the key selling season and then another group of 82 or so, hopefully, by the beginning of next year's key selling season. So we're well past halfway done and like the opportunity to do more and increase our opportunity to be competitive."", 'Robert F. Probst', ""That's a good segue to some of the assumptions you asked about in our guidance, especially redev. Let's start there. So we said our #1 use of cash is investing behind senior housing redevs. You're seeing the growth that's coming from that in the attractive returns.So last year was $210 million round numbers of redev. Because the projects are starting to come down, and I'd mentioned in previous calls we're going to normalize over time, we would expect some reduction in that redev spend this year. I'll call it $175 million in 2024. And again, that should normalize over time as these projects complete.Other assumptions, capital recycling, we are assuming, after $450 million of dispositions last year, our current guidance is $100 million. So a significant reduction, and those are very focused on some senior housing noncore assets in that $100 million. And then finally, on the equity assumption. To just underscore what I mentioned earlier, we do have, in our assumption, both investments and the funding of that. The share count is listed in the assumptions that comes out of that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush.', 'Richard Charles Anderson', ""Sorry to keep things going, but what the heck. I want to ask perhaps an unanswerable question. So you guys lead the league in kind of normalization between NAREIT FFO and normalized FFO. There's a lot in there. You have $0.13 of normalizing factors in your guidance.To what degree can we -- does that offer an opportunity for -- I don't know, if something were to materialize during the year, it sort of allows you to maintain your guidance? I'm -- there's a lot of movement in your presentation that's really difficult to model, let's put it that way.Is there a way to either tighten it up, or does it offer opportunity to say, well, we can do something with Kindred this year, and we're not going to have to change our guidance in the process. I know, unanswerable, but I do feel like it's way more complicated than perhaps it needs to be, is the main point."", 'Debra A. Cafaro', ""I mean one part I would comment on is that we are very disciplined about it and don't lead the league in any -- and this is an area we don't want to lead the league in, and we can talk about that further. It's a very defined category, and we use it as such. So, Bob..."", 'Robert F. Probst', ""(inaudible) measuring between NAREIT FFO and normalized FFO across peers, I would suggest to you that they're very similar in terms of our numbers. And by benchmark, well, I would (inaudible)..."", 'Debra A. Cafaro', 'You would say benchmark (inaudible).', 'Richard Charles Anderson', 'How often do you hit that number? How confident you are to hit that $0.13 number, I guess, is the question. How predictable is that to you?', 'Robert F. Probst', 'Which $0.13 number, Rich?', 'Richard Charles Anderson', 'The (inaudible) between NAREIT and normalized FFO.', 'Robert F. Probst', ""I see. Some of those are market-based, importantly. I'll just highlight one, which is Brookdale warrants. We have $16 million of Brookdale warrants, and that is mark-to-market every quarter, and there's a lot of volatility in that. And that flows through between NAREIT and FFO normalized (inaudible) adjustment, and that's impossible to predict. But we think in terms of portraying the underlying performance of the business is absolutely the right adjustment to make it normalized. So that's a good example."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho.', 'Vikram L. Malhotra', ""I just wanted to clarify the legal costs that were normalized. Is that -- are those just legal fees, but there's -- is there like an associated potential fine that Ventas may be liable for, and is this hard to know? Or is that just a one-off and we won't hear more about it from here on? Number one.And number two, if you could just clarify the $300 million acquisition, how should we think about accretion going forward in terms of like potential cap rates and how you see that flowing to the bottom line?"", 'Debra A. Cafaro', ""Okay. It's a typical litigation reserve and it affects us and other REITs. And in terms of the acquisition investment opportunities, I think, again, looking at the pipeline that we have, I think Justin talked about 7% plus or minus going in cap rates, which is affected by the growth rate, leading to low to mid-teens IRRs, which, depending on how we fund, will be -- that's how the accretion, obviously, in year 1 will be determined. We're not counting on a lot of accretion into year 1, but rather enhancing our growth rate over time. And we think that those IRRs are attractive, and we want to expand our presence in U.S. senior housing."", 'Operator', 'Our final question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Juan Carlos Sanabria', ""Just a quick follow-up for me, focused around dispositions again. I was curious if you have a bit of a background on the 2 R&I assets disposed of in the fourth quarter as to why you chose to sell those. The cap rates looked a little elevated from the outsider's perspective.And then just curious if -- what your latest thoughts on the Santerre SNF business is? Are you kind of happy to hold what's remaining there, which is still fairly substantial, I guess, and comfortable with that SNF exposure? Or how are you thinking about that?"", 'Debra A. Cafaro', ""Yes. So on the latter part, as I mentioned, I think we'll be -- we'll pick our spots on disposing of certain of the Santerre assets over time. Including the SNF. We've been -- we've sold some at very attractive per bed valuations, and we're happy with that.And on the -- what was the -- the others were embedded purchase options that we got in the acquired portfolio with universities who have a better cost of capital than God. So they chose to exercise them. So that's all that was."", 'Operator', 'I would now like to turn the call over to Debra Cafaro, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks.', 'Debra A. Cafaro', ""All right. Mandeep, thank you very much, and I want to thank everyone for joining us today. It's a pleasure to speak with you and have a chance to answer your questions.

This conference is being recorded. Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead."", ""Quentin McMillan: Thanks very much, and good morning. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events, and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, circumstances or management estimates or opinions should change. Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement, and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com."", ""Additionally, note that today's remarks will include results of AIG's Life & Retirement segment and other operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial. AIG's segments and U.S. GAAP financial results, as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Thursday, February 15th.

Please refer to the footnote on Page 26 of the fourth quarter financial supplement for prior period results for the Crop business and Validus RE."", ""With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino."", ""Peter Zaffino: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter and some perspective on the year, and then we'll take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. We had a very strong fourth quarter, which highlighted a significant year of achievements at AIG. Throughout 2023, we continue to build on our underwriting excellence, reposition the portfolio through several divestitures, made meaningful progress towards the deconsolidation of Corebridge, including three secondary sell-downs, deliver disciplined premium growth in businesses where we have scale and outstanding combined ratios, and continue to execute on our balanced capital management strategy."", ""I'm very proud of the work our colleagues delivered for all of our stakeholders throughout the entire year. In the fourth quarter, adjusted after-tax income per diluted common share was $1.79, an increase of 29% year-over-year, driven by continued strong underwriting results, 17% growth in net investment income, and excellent execution of our balanced capital management strategy that resulted in a 6% reduction in diluted common shares outstanding. For the full year 2023, adjusted after-tax income per diluted common share was $6.79, an increase of 33% over 2022. AIG overall produced an adjusted return on common equity of 9% for the year, up from 7% in 2022. As I will share with you today, 2023 was an extraordinary year for AIG. During my remarks this morning, I'll discuss the following topics: First, I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter financial results; Second, I will review AIG's significant accomplishments in 2023, including our strategic repositioning and our financial highlights."", ""Sabra will comment on the Life Retirement business in her prepared remarks; Third, I will cover insights on the January 1 reinsurance market and specifically AIG's reinsurance renewals; And finally, I'll share some thoughts on how we're building on our momentum and positioning the company as we enter 2024, including some specifics on AIG Next, our initiative focused on creating the AIG of the future. I will also discuss our capital management strategy and growth expectations. AIG's Strong fourth quarter results demonstrated our continued execution across all aspects of our strategy. Within general insurance, underwriting income was $642 million. Gross premiums written for the fourth quarter were $7.6 billion, an increase of 4% from the prior year quarter."", 'Net premiums written for the quarter increased by 7% from the prior year quarter to $5.7 billion. Global commercial grew 5% and global personal grew 9% from the prior year quarter. If you exclude Financial Lines, Global Commercial would have grown 11%. In North America commercial, fourth quarter net premiums written grew 5% over the prior year quarter, led by retail property, which grew 32%, Lexington, which grew 20%. These were offset by North America Financial Lines, which was lower by 13%. In international commercial, fourth quarter net premiums written grew 6% over the prior year quarter as international property grew 28% and Talbot grew 12%. These were offset by international Financial Lines, which was lower by 7%. In the fourth quarter Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 86% in its enforced portfolio, as well as very strong new business performance.', ""North America commercial produced new business of $503 million in the quarter, an increase of 21% year-over-year. The growth was led by retail casualty, Lexington, and retail property. International commercial produced new business of $467 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 14% year-over-year. This growth was led by Global Specialty and Talbot. Moving to rate, in North America commercial, overall rate increased 4% in the fourth quarter, with exposure adding 3 points, and the overall pricing was up 7%. In North America commercial, if you exclude Financial Lines and workers' compensation, overall rate would have increased 11% in the quarter and with exposure adding 4 points, overall pricing would have been 15%, meaningfully above the loss cost trend."", ""North America commercial rate increases were driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 17%, retail property, which was up 19%, and excess casualty, which was up 13%. In international commercial, overall rate increased 3% in the fourth quarter with exposure adding 2 points and the overall pricing was up 5%, which is slightly below loss cost trend. The rate increase was driven by property which was up 12% and Marine which was up 8%. Turning to personal insurance, fourth quarter net premiums written increased 9% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by North America. In North America personal, net premiums written increased 37% in the quarter. As we've seen in prior quarters in 2023 the significant premium growth for North America personal was driven by our high net worth business."", 'And, as we discussed in prior quarters, the growth in North America earned premium continued to generate a lower expense ratio and we expect the expense ratio will continue to improve in 2024. Now let me turn to the full year financial results. 2023 was another year of meaningful strategic repositioning and was in many ways our best year yet. The repositioning included the disposition of Validus RE and Crop Risk Services, which generated a combined $3.5 billion of proceeds, including a pre-closed dividend. Additionally, we settled a $1 billion intercompany loan from Validus RE to AIG and received approximately $250 million of RenaissanceRe common stock. The changes to our portfolio further reduced volatility and allowed us to focus on businesses where we believe we have better opportunities for stronger risk-adjusted returns.', ""We reshaped the reinsurance structure of our high-net-worth business and launched a newly formed MGA called Private Client Select. We made significant progress towards Corebridge's separation, another major strategic milestone on our journey to becoming a less complex company. We completed three secondary offerings in 2023 that generated approximately $2.9 billion in cash. We worked with Corebridge on the divestiture of Laya Healthcare and announced the sale of the UK Life business. In 2023, AIG received $1.4 billion of capital from Corebridge through $385 million of regular dividends, $688 million of special dividends, and $315 million of share repurchases. At the end of 2023, our ownership stake in Corebridge was approximately 52%. In 2023, we continue to execute on a thoughtful and balanced capital management strategy."", 'During the year, AIG returned $4 billion of capital to shareholders through $3 billion of share repurchases and $1 billion of dividends. We reduced our common shares outstanding by 6% and increased quarterly dividends by 12.5%. On August 1st, the AIG Board of Directors increased our share buyback authorization to $7.5 billion. At the year-end 2023, we had $6.2 billion remaining on that authorization. We reduced AIG net debt by $1.4 billion in 2023 after successfully conducting a senior notes tender offer in November. We finished 2023 with very strong parent liquidity of $7.6 billion, which gives us ample capacity to continue executing on our capital management priorities. Turning to the full year result for general insurance, throughout 2023, we delivered terrific financial performance.', 'General insurance full year underwriting income was $2.3 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year. For the full year, the general insurance accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 87.7%, an improvement of 100 basis points year-over-year. Global Commercial achieved an accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes of 83.3% for the full year. An improvement of 120 basis points year-over-year, driven by loss ratio improvement. The calendar year combined ratio was 87.1%, a 250 basis point improvement year-over-year. Excluding Validus Re and Crop Risk Services for the full year results, the Global Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, would have increased by 50 basis points to 83.8% and the calendar year combined ratio would have increased by slightly over 20 basis points to 87.3%.', 'In global personal, the full year accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 99.3%, in line with the prior year. For the full year, general insurance grew net premiums written by 7% year-over-year, driven by 5% growth in Global Commercial and 10% in personal insurance. North America commercial grew 5% and international commercial grew 6% year-over-year. A couple of highlights. Lexington and Global Specialty had outstanding years. We remained very focused on these businesses and made investments to accelerate growth and continue to deliver strong underwriting profitability. Lexington grew its net premiums written by 17% year-over-year. Growth was driven by historically high retention, which was 80%. $1 billion of new business and rate increases of approximately 18%.', ""Global specialty, which includes businesses in marine, energy, trade, credit, and aviation, grew its net premiums written 10% year-over-year, driven by 88% retention, almost $750 million of new business, and rate increases of 7% for the year. Also, there are two parts of our business that impacted growth in Global Commercial, which I would like to offer some perspective. First, if you exclude Financial Lines, our net premiums written growth would have been 10%. Second, as we've outlined on prior calls, we decided to non-renew two programs that had significant property catastrophe exposure that no longer met our underwriting guidelines. We did not believe that the premium increases on a risk-adjusted basis for these two programs delivered an acceptable return."", ""The decision to non-renew impacted the gross and net premiums written for Lexington specifically, as well as the Global Commercial business throughout 2023. If you exclude Financial Lines and these two programs that I just mentioned, our year-over-year net premiums written growth would have been 13%, which gives you a sense as to why we have significant confidence in our core portfolio where we saw meaningful overall growth for the year. It's worth providing a little bit more detail on Financial Lines. In Financial Lines, particularly in our public directors and officers book of business, we continue to exercise underwriting discipline by maintaining our primary position in our portfolio and being very prudent on large account excess layers, where there's significant exposure to vertical loss."", ""And these layers are highly commoditized where typically the best price wins. We've spoken about the cumulative rate change in Financial Lines before, but I want to provide a little bit more detail. The compound annual growth rate for Financial Lines achieved from 2019 through 2023 was 49%. If you exclude 2023, the compound annual growth rate was 63%. It's a business we're very focused on, and our underwriters are continuing to carefully monitor market conditions and underwrite conservatively. Now, I'd like to provide you with some insight into the current reinsurance market generally and an overview of our January 1 reinsurance renewals. As I mentioned on previous calls, AIG's reinsurance purchasing is deliberately weighted to January 1, which enables us to strategically optimize the outcome across our reinsurance placements and provides us with clarity on our cost of reinsurance at the beginning of the year."", ""Before I go into detail on this year's outcomes, I want to speak about how we evaluate our reinsurance purchased. We've seen significant changes in the global property market over the last two years and analyzing and quantifying changes in a portfolio's risk profile has become increasingly complex. Currently, one of the most overused phrases that has been used with more frequency in the last year is risk-adjusted pricing or risk-adjusted rate changes, which have multiple interpretations, particularly when it comes to property treaty reinsurance. Calculating the risk-adjusted rate change can be complicated and is often inconsistent. I want to outline how AIG determines risk-adjusted pricing changes, which we believe is an industry best practice."", 'To begin, you must determine the baseline structure and all the variables required to assess and quantify the risk-adjusted pricing change. To do that, the base analysis should be set at the identical structure and coverage with the exact terms and conditions of the prior year structure. The analysis needs to compare the cost of capital year-over-year, and any model changes from vendor model output, such as RMS, to determine if the loss costs have increased or decreased at the attachment point and the vertical limits deployed. Also, an analysis is needed for any changes to the coverage provided in the treaty placement. For instance, over the last few years many programs have gone from an all risk coverage basis to a named or peak peril basis.', 'To correctly calculate the risk adjusted rate change, perils no longer covered need to be analyzed and priced separately and the impact of any reduced coverage should be factored into the assessment of the price change. This can be particularly difficult when assessing perils that would not be economically viable to place on a standalone basis with significant limits, which could include wildfire, flood, or terrorism. There needs to be consideration given to the volatility associated with the expected loss in calculating the risk-adjusted rate change. Given the complexity of these calculations, the methodologies applied should be done with consistency and discipline. When applying the methodology I just described, AIG had a tremendous outcome with our reinsurance partners at the January 1 renewal season, building upon the very strong result achieved in a very challenging market in 2023.', ""Now, let me turn to AIG's reinsurance renewals at January 1 of this year. To level set, the natural catastrophe insured loss activity remained at the forefront of the market with a record-setting 37 events in 2023 that exceed $1 billion of insured loss. These events contributed to a total annual insured loss currently estimated at over a $100 billion, marking the sixth time in the past seven years that insured loss from natural catastrophes has exceeded $100 billion. Over the last seven years, there's been nearly $1 trillion of aggregate losses with over 60% driven by secondary perils. The headline is, that we were able to significantly improve our property CAT structure and reinsurance coverage provided. When you review what we purchased last year, including for Validus RE, the overall spend has reduced by approximately $200 million and our core property treaties excluding Validus RE have slightly lower seated premium year-over-year."", ""Let's start with our property catastrophe placements. Our core commercial North America retention of $500 million remained unchanged for the second straight year. The attachment on our dedicated Lexington occurrence tower was unchanged at $300 million. In both cases, the modeled attachment point is lower and the exhaust limit is higher. Our international property CAT per current structures renewed with a reduced retention in Japan to $150 million, a $50 million improvement from the prior year. The rest of the world attachment remains unchanged at $125 million. We were very pleased to have achieved broader coverage across all of our core occurrence towers. With nominal attachment points unchanged, or in the case of Japan, decreasing, the model probability of attaching our CAT reinsurance improved with respect to key perils and across every major territory following the growth achieved in the property portfolio in 2023."", 'Our property CAT aggregate cover was also successfully renewed with improved coverage, further reducing our volatility from frequency of loss. The aggregate now includes a standalone sublimit dedicated to losses in North America arising from secondary perils. Importantly, it also now covers contributing losses from our high net worth portfolio. Our annual aggregate deductible for North America is $825 million. The North America Other Perils deductible is $350 million, which is a new deductible, and Japan and the rest of the world deductibles are $200 million and $175 million, respectively. These are subject to each and every loss deductible of $20 million, other than for North America wind and earthquake, which are at $50 million. Our return period attachment point is lower year-over-year.', ""For all of our major proportional treaties across a range of classes, we improved or maintain our ceding commission levels, reflecting our market leading underwriting expertise, and position in the market. Turning to casualty, the challenges we've spoken about previously regarding the impact of inflation, both social and economic, and litigation funding in the U.S. were a focal point for reinsurers at one-one. For casualty at AIG, we remain very focused on our underwriting standards and the positioning of the portfolio. Our team has done a terrific job of re-underwriting the entire business, particularly considering the amount of work that was needed to reposition it to where it is today. Additionally, our pricing assumptions today have lost trends ranging from the high single digits to over 10%."", 'These were increased over the past two years given inflationary dynamics. I do want to make a few comments about the last 10 years of casualty results for the industry. The industry as a whole has reported meaningful reserve releases in four of the past 10 calendar years, including in calendar year 2017. At the same time, there have been six years of significant reported industry strengthening in the last 10 calendar years, including in all of the most recent five calendar years. Focusing on AIG, for accident years 2016 through 2019, our initial loss picks in our casualty lines excluding workers compensation averaged 78%. Looking specifically at accident years 2016 and 2017, the initial loss picks were approximately 81% in both years. These loss picks exclude unallocated loss adjustment expense.', 'We significantly strengthened the reserves by over $1 billion for accident years 2016 through 2019, which revised our year-end ultimate loss picks to 91% in 2016 and 96% in 2017 and an average of 87% over accident years 2016 through 2019. To further analyze our casualty results compared to industry results for other liability in commercial auto, using the most recent Schedule P data, they are well above the average industry loss picks on both measures. Our initial and year-end ultimates for both lines are roughly 10 to 20 points higher than the overall industry average. In addition, we have reinsurance in place for 2016 and 2017 to mitigate our gross results. As we outlined last quarter, we put a comprehensive reinsurance treaty in place starting in 2018 that provides us with a substantial amount of vertical protection.', ""Our renewal of the casualty reinsurance protections allowed us to maintain the same net retain lines with no impact on ceding commissions, which is an outstanding outcome. At January 1, our reinsurance partners maintained their significant support of AIG with consistent capacity and improved reinsurance terms that demonstrate a clear recognition of the quality of our portfolio and our underwriting teams. I'll now turn to discuss our efforts to create a future state business structure for AIG post-deconsolidation of Corebridge. As part of this effort, we've launched a new program, AIG Next, to create a company that's leaner, less complex, and more effective with the appropriate infrastructure and capabilities for the size of business we will be post-deconsolidation."", ""AIG Next will focus on the following key principles: Driving global consistency and local relevancy across our end-to-end processes to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness; Reducing organizational complexity to create a better and differentiated experience for our clients and colleagues, creating an agile and scalable organization to support business growth, optimizing our ecosystem to modernize our data analytics, digital, and technology capabilities, clarifying roles responsibilities while eliminating duplication, and increasing our speed of execution. As we've stated in the past, we expect the simplification and efficiencies created through this program to generate $500 million of sustained annual run rate savings and to incur approximately $500 million in one-time spend to achieve these savings."", ""As part of AIG Next, we are creating a leaner parent company with a target cost structure of 1% to 1.5% of net premiums earned. Some of the current costs and other operations will be eliminated, contributing to the $500 million savings, and others will be moved into the business where the service is utilized. In 2023, we began this work. As we've moved approximately $140 million of expenses from other operations into general insurance for services that are more closely aligned to our business operations. Even with this shift, the full year combined ratio of 90.6% improved 130 basis points year-over-year, and the full year GOE ratio only increased 40 basis points due to offsetting savings within general insurance. Throughout the year, we've built efficiencies into our business which have allowed general insurers to absorb these costs."", ""We've already begun to make meaningful progress against our $500 million savings target and have established a team to drive and govern the AIG Next program with focus and discipline. Sabra and I will provide more detail on next quarter's call regarding the specific cost to achieve by category and the expected timeline for the realized benefits in 2024 and 2025. As we are approaching the final steps of the Corebridge deconsolidation, we remain agile and continue to explore all options based on market conditions with respect to our remaining ownership of Corebridge, always focusing on what's aligned with the best interests of our stakeholders. Sabra will take you through a pro forma capital structure based on assumptions about the deconsolidation."", ""Throughout 2024, we expect to continue to execute the capital management strategy we've outlined before. Our insurance company subsidiaries continue to have excess capital to support the type of organic growth we have seen through 2023 and would expect to see in the future. We've made enormous progress on our debt structure and maturities. Since year-end 2021, we've reduced over 50% of AIG's debt outstanding, which is over $11 billion of debt reduction. The primary focus in 2024 will be on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Since the start of 2024, we have repurchased an additional $760 million of common shares. We expect to continue at this pace for the first half of 2024, subject to market conditions, which should bring us near the high end of our target share count range."", ""Post Corebridge deconsolidation, we should achieve the low end of our range, which is approximately 600 million of common shares. The AIG board increased the dividend in 2023, reflecting our confidence in the future earnings power of AIG, and we will continue to evaluate our dividend policy in 2024. And lastly, as I enter my seventh year at AIG, I've never been more optimistic about our opportunities for growth and the momentum that AIG has entering 2024. We now have a terrific business. Global Commercial, which we've been working on for years to reposition, is now one of the most respected portfolios in the industry. While there's always pruning to do in any business, the remediation is now behind us. We're well positioned to grow based on AIG’s strong retention, strong opportunities for new business, excellent combined ratios, and a company that has been able to distinguish itself amongst our clients and distribution partners."", 'In personal insurance, we will continue to make investments, particularly in our Japan business, our global A&H business, and our high-net-worth business, where we anticipate continued growth, and more importantly, profitability improvement. With that, I will turn the call over to Sabra.', ""Sabra Purtill: Thank you, Peter. This morning I will provide more detail on AIG's fourth quarter results, but first, as we are getting closer to Corebridge deconsolidation, I would like to start with an illustrative pro forma. With AIG's current ownership of Corebridge at 52%, the next transaction may likely result in deconsolidation. Today, Corebridge is consolidated in both AIG's balance sheet and income statement with offsets of non-controlling interest for the portion that AIG does not own. You can see those adjustments in the financial supplement on Pages 8 and 11. When we deconsolidate, we will report Corebridge as an investment with dividends reported in net investment income and Corebridge shares included in parent investments."", ""Corebridge's balance sheet and income statement will no longer be in our financials. If we were able to deconsolidate Corebridge now, accounting rules require us to fair value their assets and liabilities and recognize the net difference between that valuation and the current [GAAP] (ph) carrying value in AIG's equity. That process also includes some changes, primarily driven by differences in basis and deconsolidation of variable investment entities. The example I will provide is a hypothetical pro-forma view. Please remember that there are many factors and each one impacts the output. This view builds on the remarks I provided last quarter about pro-forma adjusted shareholders' equity. For simplicity, in this example we use Corebridge's current stock price as a proxy for fair value, but the process is more complicated than that and is more dependent on interest rates than stock price, as the investment portfolio has to be valued on the day of deconsolidation, which will change based on interest rates."", ""As a very high-level illustration, as of year-end, the fair value of Corebridge's net assets and liabilities was about $2 billion higher than the book value on AIG's balance sheet. As a result, deconsolidation would have increased AIG's book value per share by almost $3 a share. However, for AIG's adjusted shareholders' equity, the fair value adjustment would have resulted in a reduction of about $4 billion, or around $6 per AIG share, given Corebridge's stock price relative to its adjusted book value. Now let me link these items to the AIG year-end pro forma estimate that I provided last quarter of adjusted shareholders equity of approximately $33 billion, adjusted for the sale of Validus RE to be used in evaluating the ROCE target. At December 31, 2023, AIG's adjusted shareholders' equity was approximately $53 billion."", ""With the pro forma fair value decrease of $4 billion at deconsolidation, adjusted shareholders' equity would be roughly $49 billion, including about $8 billion of value for our Corebridge shares. To get to the [E] (ph), we subtract the value of core bridge shares, and for the purposes of this exercise today, we also subtract year in parent liquidity of almost $8 billion, most of which is to be used for 2024 capital management, interest, and other parent expenses, as Peter described. That results in pro forma adjusted shareholders equity of about $33 billion invested in our business, plus whatever liquidity is at the parent as the focus of our 10% plus target. This example is illustrative based on year-end financials and subject to change based on markets and the actual path to deconsolidation, but I hope it is helpful."", 'Now I will turn to fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.5 billion, up 17% over the fourth quarter of 2022. General insurance net investment income was 38%, while Life & Retirement was up 15%. Higher new money reinvestment rates in both businesses drove the improvement. Fourth quarter new money rates on fixed maturities and loans averaged 6.5%, about 180 basis points higher than the yield on sales and maturities in the quarter. Fourth quarter new money rates were 160 basis points higher in GI and 190 basis points higher in L&R. With higher reinvestment rates, the yield on general insurance fixed maturities and loans, excluding calls and prepayments rose to an annualized yield of 3.8% in the quarter, up from 3.0% in 4Q 2022 and up 9 basis points sequentially.', ""L&R's fourth quarter portfolio yield was 5.0% compared to 4.4% in 4Q 2022 and up 10 basis points sequentially. In the first half of 2024, we currently expect continued yield pickup on fixed maturities over the prior year, but less improvement sequentially, given the cessation of Fed interest rate hikes and the current shape of the yield curve. In contrast, alternative investment returns were weak this year, coming in slightly negative in the fourth quarter and at only 2.4% for the full year. GI alternative income was $41 million in the fourth quarter, down 11% from the prior year quarter, for an annualized return of 3.9%. L&R's alternative portfolio generated a loss of $24 million in the quarter for an annualized yield of negative 1.8% compared to income of $16 million last year."", ""Turning to general insurance, as Peter said, our underwriting results remain very strong. The 4Q 2023 calendar year combined ratio was 89.1%, 80 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2022, and the accident year combined ratio ex-CATs was 87.9%, 50 basis points better. Global Commercial Lines delivered outstanding fourth quarter results with a calendar year combined ratio of 85.4%, a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year. The accident year combined ratio ex-CATs was 82.4%, a 170 basis point improvement, reflecting exceptional underwriting profitability in both North America and International. The fourth quarter included only one month of Validus RE due to the timing of the divestiture. Excluding Validus RE from fourth quarter results, the pro forma Global Commercial Line's calendar year combined ratio would have been 85.1%, 30 basis points lower than reported."", 'The accident year combined ratio ex-CATs would have been 82.5%, only 10 basis points higher. The fourth quarter calendar year combined ratio for Global Personal Insurance was 98.8%, 90 basis points better than 4Q 2022. The accident year combined ratio ex-CATs was 101.8%, 140 basis points higher, driven by the repositioning of the high net worth business, which made significant progress in 2023. Fourth quarter underwriting income for GI was $642 million, up slightly from $635 million in 4Q 2022, as improved accident year results, including catastrophe losses, were offset by lower favorable prior year development, net of reinsurance, and prior year premiums. Catastrophe losses totaled $126 million in the quarter, down from $235 million last year.', 'The largest event was Hurricane Otis in Mexico. For the fourth quarter and the year, catastrophe losses excluding Validus RE would have been $111 million and $937 million, respectively. Favorable prior year development totaled $69 million in the fourth quarter compared to $151 million in 4Q 2022. Including the impact of prior year premiums, the total impact of prior year loss reserve development was favorable by $37 million compared to favorable development of $150 million in 4Q 2022. Fourth quarter net favorable development this quarter includes $41 million of ADC gain amortization and $28 million of net favorable development from annual DVRs and other reserve reviews, particularly prior year catastrophes. The $28 million included $75 million in additional reserves for Russia-Ukraine related claims offset by net favorable development on shorter tail lines and older catastrophes.', ""Turning to L&R, fourth quarter results were solid, especially considering the continued headwinds from alternative investment returns. Fourth quarter APTI was $957 million, up 12% over the prior year, driven by base spread expansion, strong sales, and growth in assets under management and administration. Base net investment spreads and individual group retirement together widen 23 basis points in the quarter. Fourth quarter premiums and deposits were $10.6 billion, up 20% from 4Q 2022. For the fourth quarter, Corebridge's earnings included an AIG-adjusted after-tax income decreased by about 25% due to the reduction in AIG ownership from 78% last year to 52% as of year-end. For the full year, Corebridge earnings in our adjusted after-tax income declined 20%."", ""Turning to other operations, fourth quarter 2023 adjusted pre-tax loss improved by $52 million from 4Q 2022 due to a $72 million reduction in AIG general operating expenses. Total other operations GOE was $242 million for the quarter, including $61 million for Corebridge. On a consolidated basis, AIG's fourth quarter adjusted after-tax income rose 21% to $1.3 billion, driven by 19% growth in general insurance, APTI. The annualized adjusted return on common equity was 9.4% for the quarter, almost 2 points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022. Moving to the balance sheet, book value per common share ended the year at $65.14, up 18% from year-end 2022, and up 16% from September 30th, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates. Adjusted book value per share was $76.65 at year-end, up 1% from year-end 2022, and down 2% for September 30th, reflecting the net impact of income, dividends, share repurchases, and Corebridge secondary sales."", ""At December 31st, AIG's consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital excluding AOCI was 24.3%, down 1.3 points from year-end 2022. With first quarter 2024 debt reduction, leverage is likely to be at the low end of our 20% to 25% range upon deconsolidation. As Peter noted, we made substantial progress towards a 10% plus ROCE goal this year. 2023 full year adjusted ROCE for AIG was 9.0% compared to 7.1% in 2022 and was 12.5% in general insurance and 11.5% in L&R. The actions to reach 10% or greater will be driven by the four levers we have discussed before, including AIG Next. We are confident in our ability to achieve this goal, subject to market conditions, and look forward to updating you on our progress. With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter."", ""Peter Zaffino: Thank you, Sabra. Michelle, we're ready for questions."", 'Operator: Thank you.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) has surged significantly, from $492 to almost $558.50 per share within three days. After the recent rally, the stock has gained 57% over the past 12 months, only 14.50% lower than its all-time high recorded in November 2021. After the recent bullish market momentum, I believe Netflix is now fairly valued.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with BABA.', 'A global leader in streaming, Netflix has managed to grow its subscribers consistently over the past decade. Its subscriber count has significantly increased by 7.60 times, from 34.24 million in the first quarter of 2013 to 260.28 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. To attract and retain streaming users, the company has made heavy investments in original content production, content acquisition and licensing agreements.', 'Source: Statista', 'Over the past 20 years, Netflix has consistently grown its revenue and operating income. Its revenue has steadily increased from $272.24 million in 2003 to $33.70 billion in 2023, delivering a compounded annual growth rate of 27.20%. Its operating income has also followed a similar trend, rising from $4.50 million to $6.95 billion over the same period, representing a remarkable compounded annual growth rate of 44.40%. Although its operating margin has fluctuated, ranging from 1.39% to 13.12% between 2003 and 2015, there has been a consistent and decent improvement over the past seven years. From 2016 to 2023, the operating margin has surged from 4.3% to over 20.6%.', ""Despite the increase in revenue and operating income, Netflix experienced minimal and subsequent declining operating cash flow and free cash flow from 2014 to 2019. However, following this period, its cash flow generation began to trend upward, culminating in a significant rise by 2023. Specifically, in 2019, Netflix's operating cash flow deteriorated to -$2.89 billion, alongside a negative free cash flow of $3.14 billion. In contrast, by 2023, these figures had dramatically improved, with operating cash flow soaring to $7.27 billion and free cash flow increasing to $6.93 billion."", ""The earlier negative operating cash flow and free cash flow were largely attributed to its substantial investments in content assets. These investments grew significantly, from $8.60 billion in 2016 to over $16.80 billion in 2023. These investments in content assets were a significant deduction from the operating cash flow. The turnaround in operating cash flow over the past three years can be credited to the company's net profit growth, which exceeded the increase in content asset investments."", ""In the final quarter of 2023, Netflix demonstrated impressive financial performance, with revenue reaching $8.83 billion, a 12.50% increase from the previous year and surpassing analysts' estimates by $120 million."", 'This growth has been driven by several strategic initiatives. It diversified its pricing plans and introduced advertisement-driven memberships. This led to 70% quarter-over-quarter growth, accounting for 40% of all sign-ups in some markets. Moreover, it successfully monetized account sharing without losing users. As a result, Netflix experienced a steady increase in paid memberships, which grew from 207.64 million at the start of 2021 to 260.28 million by the end of 2023. In the last quarter of the year alone, the global paid members count increased by 13.12 million, with significant growth in the U.S. and Canada. Furthermore, the average revenue per membership increased in most regions.', ""The company's net income had good growth in the fourth quarter, reaching $981 million, or $2.11 in earnings per share, significantly higher than the earnings of 12 cents per share in the same quarter last year. Its operating cash flow has also improved, reaching $1.66 billion. Netflix anticipates continued growth in the first quarter of 2024, projecting estimated profits of $1.97 billion, or $4.49 per share."", ""Netflix has consistently managed its leverage effectively. As of December, the company's total stockholders' equity was $20.60 billion, with cash and cash equivalents reaching $7.10 billion. The interest-bearing debt amounted to $14.54 billion. Thus, the net debt settled at $7.44 billion, with a debt-to-equity ratio at a reasonable level of 0.70."", ""The company has historically maintained its leverage at manageable levels. Its interest coverage ratio, a metric assessing the company's ability to generate enough profit to cover interest expenses on outstanding debt, has always remained at a high level. Notably, while long-term debt has increased substantially from $2.37 billion in 2015 to $14.14 billion in 2023, the interest coverage ratio has shown significant improvement, rising from 1.87 in 2015 to 9.29 in 2023, thanks to the improvement in profitability. Thus, Netflix is in a comfortable position to cover its interest and debt obligations."", ""Over the past 15 years, Netflix's Ebitda multiples have fluctuated in a wide range, from 1.62 to 34. Following the 2009 economic downturn, its Ebitda multiples exceeded 20 on two occasions: reaching 20.45 in 2010 and 23.60 in 2018. Currently, its valuation stands at a reasonable multiple of 10.11 times its Ebitda. The present market valuation is only 7% above the 15-year average Ebitda multiple of 10.84, suggesting Netflix's current share price is fairly valued."", ""Let's use the discounted free cash flow method to value Netflix. We assume the company's free cash flow grows by 20% over the next decade, followed by a 2% growth in the subsequent 10 years. With an 8% discount rate, the estimated share price for Netflix would be $614.56. This figure is only 10% above its current share price, further supporting the conclusion that the stock is currently fairly valued."", ""The company's global reach, innovative pricing strategies and focus on content have driven a remarkable increase in subscribers and revenue, showcasing its dominance in the streaming industry. With consistent revenue growth, successful monetization strategies like advertisement-driven memberships and account sharing, along with a significant rise in paid memberships, Netflix is expected to outperform in a competitive landscape. The improvement in operating cash flow and net income, alongside effective debt management, further solidifies its financial stability. Netflix's valuation, based on my analysis, aligns closely with its current market price, suggesting the stock is reasonably valued now."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

It wasn’t just the better-than-expected numbers but recent moves, including taking a $1.5 billion stake in Fortnite-maker Epic Games, that have me viewing Disney as a potential back door into the realm of the Metaverse.', 'As Disney’s top boss and CEO, Bob Iger, looks to bring the firm back to the top again, it’s hard not to be a raging bull on the stock. Combined with more activism from activist investor Nelson Peltz (he’s still pursuing board seats), looking to pressure for positive change, I couldn’t be more bullish on the stock as it looks to pivot.', 'With the stake in Epic Games, the recent sports streaming partnership with rival streamers, and news of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour coming to the Disney+ streaming platform, there hasn’t been this much to be excited about with regards to Disney in quite a while.', 'In many ways, Taylor Swift’s Eras could be the biggest non-Disney production to land on the platform since the firm brought Broadway hit sensation Hamilton just a few years ago. Though Eras could give consumers another reason to resume their Disney+ subscriptions, I view the biggest takeaway from the latest quarter (and commentary) as Disney’s ambition when it comes to the virtual realm.', 'Further, the streaming of concert tours represents a stark contrast to the content offered by other video streamers. Though concerts, plays, and recorded live experiences are fun to view through your television, I believe that they are best enjoyed in the realm of virtual reality.', 'Disney’s openness to exploring the realm of virtual reality and spatial computing is nothing new. Remember when Bob Iger was on stage during the reveal of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro? Iger saw the potential in Apple’s latest product, and his firm’s recent bets look like they’d translate into the realm of immersive worlds very nicely.', 'Disney+ has been hot on Vision Pro’s tracks since day one, even as some of its peers, most notably Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) opted not to develop a native visionOS app in these early stages for Apple’s newest product. Personally, I think Netflix has a lot to lose if it doesn’t end up creating a slew of content for the new spatial medium, as Disney has. Of course, Netflix has deep enough pockets to play catch up at a later date, perhaps when headsets become more commonplace in the household.', 'For now, though, Disney has its sights set on the future. And for that reason, I prefer Disney over the likes of Netflix. In many ways, Disney seems to be on the right track, bringing must-see “experiences” like Eras to its platform. Imagine experiencing the content on a 100-foot screen on your Vision Pro headset. Such an experience will make like you’re almost a part of the action.', 'In the future, I’d look for Disney to invest more in spatial cameras for various productions — like those on the iPhone 15 Pro line — that can deliver “spatial” experiences that take the immersive factor to the next level. In its current state, the Vision Pro seems like a risky innovation to shrug off through the eyes of a prospective content creator. However, in a few years, it could become a must-have device as more content from Disney and others lands gradually.', 'Over time, it’s certainly not hard to envision a flood of high-quality “spatial” content storming over to the Vision Pro, perhaps thanks in part to forward-thinking content creators like Disney. Apart from concerts, video games, and other experiences, Disney’s sports streaming push may be just the first step to achieving the holy grail of virtual court-side seats via spatial computers and VR headsets.', 'Indeed, ESPN has been a drag on Disney’s business for quite some time. But in the realm of spatial computing and streaming, the ESPN acquisition may finally prove its worth. Even if spatial computing takes a couple more years to take off (the form factor remains a tad too bulky), I have to say I’m impressed with where Disney is headed. It looks to be strolling right into the Metaverse. And if virtual-reality headsets end up a success, I’d argue that Disney could have what it takes to fight back at Netflix at long last.', 'On TipRanks, DIS stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 21 analyst ratings, there are 16 Buys, four Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average DIS stock price target\xa0is $115.50, implying upside potential of 2.7%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $82.00 per share to a high of $130.00 per share.', 'In many ways, Disney seems to be the ultimate metaverse content play, as it looks to become one of the bigger developers for so-called “killer” apps on the next generation of spatial computing products.', 'From sports streaming to metaverse-like video games (think Epic’s Fortnite) and recorded concert experiences, Disney seems to be rolling the dice on the Metaverse. And it certainly could win in a big way as the field evolves. Indeed, Disney and Apple seem to be forming a symbiotic relationship as both look to unlock the full power of the immersive virtual worlds of tomorrow.', 'Disclosure']"

Welcome to Motley Fool Money, I'm Deidre Woollard here with Motley Fool Analyst Rick Munarriz. Rick, how are you doing today?"", ""Rick Munarriz: I'm doing fantastic today do you think?"", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, I'm wondering if Disney's earnings have something to do with that 'cause I consider you to be Disney-ficionado, Disney bull perhaps. Last night's earnings, it seemed to be it was definitely all over the place. But it seemed to send the message that the strategies working earnings per share were up. Company's really done so well at cutting costs, cut $500 million in SG&A expenses. They're headed toward that $7.5 billion goal. It's not the most thrilling thing we've ever heard, but how important are savings to Disney right now?"", ""Rick Munarriz: Right now, it's very important. Again this 7.5 billion, this was $5.5 billion a year ago when back in February of 2023 Bob Iger said hey, I think we can save $5.5 billion in annualized savings costs. In November, just a couple of months ago they said all right, we can actually raise this 7.5 billion. Now he's saying meet or exceed 7.5 billion that exceed word is new. The fact that savings are happening and you're saying great, what does this mean? That Disney found a few more Disney dollars under its seat cushion sofa. But what it means is Disney right now on the top line, isn't a very exciting story organically. It's had a couple of movies basically strike out at the box office. Cord cutting is hurting its legacy business. It's theme parks which have been strong, attendance has been sluggish the last couple of quarters at Disney World and Florida strong everywhere else. It's not running on all cylinders on the top line. If it can save money and improve as an earnings story which is exactly what we saw play out this quarter, I think it will continue to get investors excited the way it did this time around."", ""Deidre Woollard: It seems like investors were pretty excited about that. They were increasing the dividend. It's not where it was before they had to stop it during the pandemic, but it's up 50% from the last dividend, so that certainly seems like a good start. They announced some interesting things. Let's start with the first one, which is $1.5 billion stake in Epic Games. It seems like it's a little bit about the Fortnite brand, but it seems like it's more about bringing gaming opportunities to the Disney IP. I'm both ways about this, I see Netflix and others doing this. I know gaming is very popular. What should we be looking for here? It's probably going to take at least a year or so, I think for this to figure out if this is money well spent."", ""Rick Munarriz: It's going to take time, this isn't something that you just snap your fingers and pixie dust and everything Disney is now, you can just walk into Toy Story in the middle of a Fortnite realm. But I do think that it's a good move for Disney on the gaming end. They've always struggled when they try to do it in house. Their best successes have been when they license it out to someone. This is their partners with Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic Games they've worked with him before. This makes sense and Fortnite, who knows what'll be popularity wise a couple of years ago. It seemed to be sluggish a year or two ago, but it's had a resurgence since the end of last year, where it'll be by the time this launches. But the important thing about Fortnite to me and the whole Epic Games universe, is 85% of the gamers on Fortnite are 35 years or younger. This is a demographic that Disney needs to reach if they want new blood especially a lot of younger people that are very jaded. They're not listening to branded ads, consumers, they're not even consuming ads for the most part. This is a way to reach out to them and push out their franchises and eventually some e commerce opportunities they were talking about through this venture. I think it's a good move and again, it's hard to talk about a $1.5 billion investment when Disney's trying to save money on the other hand. But I think there are times where you do have to spend money to make money and to remain relevant, and I do like this deal."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, you've mentioned something about attracting younger viewers. Our colleague, Ricky Mulvey, made a list of some of the new things they announced and they aren't that new. I mean, everything seems to be either a sequel or an extension of existing IP, like Dead Pool 3, Inside Out 2, Moana 2, you've got a new Lion King movie. I mean, yes, you're betting on sure things, but also is there some concern that there just isn't any place new to go for this company?"", ""Rick Munarriz: I think there's a balance of everything here. Inside Out it was just a new franchise just a couple of years ago. You do have a case where franchises happen. Again, we can look at like Billy Joel putting out, writing his first song in 30 years, but people are still going to the Billy Joel concerts, still selling out Madison Square Garden. Not that Disney wants to retread everything that it's put out before, but there's familiarity. The fact that we're getting a Lion King movie, a Moana movie, a Dead Pool, Inside Out, an aliens movie, a Planet of the Apes movies, all this calendar year from Disney after they had such a terrible year last year. Makes me feel comfortable that, hey, this is going to be a good year for Disney at the local multiplex. Whereas if it was just a bunch of unproven properties, I hope some of these brand-new hits hit because a franchise always starts with that first movie. I do think that if they were relying too much on it, you get to the problem of what Disney had, where they just play it safe and that got them into trouble before. But right now, when they need hits, you're going to go to your moneymakers, and I think that's what they're doing right now."", ""Deidre Woollard: At least on the streaming side, they'll have a little extra dose of Taylor Swift. That will help as well because they announced the Eras movie with additional content, so they'll get this."", ""Rick Munarriz: March 15, every Tate fan out there already has that date circled ready. Whatever era is, they prefer Taylor's version ready to go?"", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, let's switch from Taylor to sports. Let's talk a little bit about ESPN."", ""Rick Munarriz: Isn't Taylor sports anyway? These days she's always at a."", ""Deidre Woollard: Of course she is. It is The Taylor Bowl this year. Let's talk a little bit about ESPN. I mean, I've been watching what they've been doing with ESPN for a while and they keep talking about what they were going to do next and not really delivering. Now it seems like we've got some real concrete plans. You've got two things happening. The first is came out the day before earnings, they announced with the ESPN Linear Network. That's going to be in what they call the Skinny Sports bundle with Warner Bros Discovery Fox. Then there's also going to be the direct to consumer ESPN streaming service that comes out in the fall of 2025. What fascinated me about this was the sports bundle, the Wall Street Journal called it a blind side to the sports leagues. Does this change the game for them?"", ""Rick Munarriz: Not that it changes the game, but it makes sure that they're the ones running the ball. Just as ESPN has been the dominant sports leader. This is a company I given said CNBC right before the earnings squall right after the report, he's saying, hey, I'd rather be a disruptor than being disrupted. He's known for years that cord cutting is basically eating away at the legacy, carrier rights that they have through the cable networks and the satellite television. He doesn't want to turn their backs on them. He struck deals with them to try to, keep them afloat. But he knows that the real money has to come from the streaming side. It's better for someone else to get together with two of its biggest rivals in sports content to create that skinny bundle or to go directly over the top and reach consumers directly the way it is with the ESPN and the larger ESPN offering that's coming out next year, in the fall of next year. I do think that it's the right move and I don't think the leagues will be too upset. There are people upset that the watch a playoff game on Peacock, this NFL season, so it's better to have just the network that everybody knows is the one that do it, rather than go, oh, it's Thursday? Do I need to fire up Amazon Prime this time? Do I need to have YouTube TV to catch the NFL Sunday ticket? There's a lot of weird choices people have to make. ESPN is like the default setting, so I think anything they do is a good thing."", ""Deidre Woollard: I've experienced that myself in trying to figure out where something I want to watch actually is located. The other thing I find interesting about this is the ESPN solo thing, because you mentioned that CNBC interview with Bob. I listened to that too, and you described that experience as more immersive with shopping and with betting. It didn't come up on the earnings call, but I'm very curious about their sports betting business. Their collaboration with Penn seems like it's certainly being promoted a lot. But is it going to be a while before we actually, hear how it's doing and it ends up in the reporting?"", ""Rick Munarriz: I think Disney they've always tiptoed around the gambling aspect of it if you go on a Disney cruise ship. Again, I haven't been on it in a couple of years, but every time, that's the one cruise line where I know I'm not going to go to a casino because they don't have them. At least they didn't have them a couple years ago. They've been very careful about this, so obviously they weren't just going to launch their own online sports book. They, start to deal with Penn for ESPN bet. It's been out for a couple months now. It makes sense that if you're going to be doing it a point now, everybody, everything's fund this drafting this, it's MGM bet this. The sports books are everywhere, they're commonplace. It will become acceptable for Disney possibly to do it on its own eventually. But right now, I think it makes sense if you're putting out this bundled package of sports programming, you may as well realize that I'm reaching fans, fantasy sports fans of actual wagering on games. Why am I not cashing in on this when they are basically in the driver's seat."", ""Deidre Woollard: If it's a stand-alone streaming thing, is there a point where you're betting with your remote? It sounded like that was what Iger was hinting at."", ""Rick Munarriz: Yeah, and it was. Fubo TV to bring out a company that basically, hates this news because they thought they had this market cornered and they basically, got crushed the Brother and the Fox and the Disney ESPN Collection they hate that. But you could have actually used your remote. They were trying to set it out before they pulled out of the online sportsbook market, where you can use your remote or an app tied to what you're watching. Real time, it follows you so it knows what you're watching. You get real time bets on your phone. Who knows what the future will be. Hopefully, again, and gambling is an addiction. Hopefully it's done in a way that doesn't, destroy us all. But clearly, it's a money making opportunity for Disney."", ""Deidre Woollard: Definitely. Well, speaking of money making a little bit, you mentioned earlier the parks in experience business, it's great globally, you mentioned that weakness domestically. Some of that, they're coming off the 50th anniversary celebrations. There's a lot of media out there about it's too expensive. A lot of families complaining. You're in Florida, what have you seen?"", ""Rick Munarriz: It is expensive every year, and it's not just Disney World, the rivals too. One of them raises prices, the other one's going to raise prices, if annual passes get more expensive, sometimes Disney even stop selling annual passes. They do that in Disneyland, and they even did it for a little while at Disney World that they're saying, there's just too many people in the parks. Now it's the opposite where they want more people in the parks, they're putting more promotional aspects to it but I think there's a lot of factors into it but, again, Disneyland is doing fine. They opened a year later, about technically nine months after Disney World. Disney World opened in July 2020, Disneyland in April 2021 so the whole travel revenge travel phase played out earlier in Florida than it did out in California but you do have a case where they had that 100th celebration. Disney World opened a couple of really big rides, two very game changing roller coasters, and two of its steam parks, but that ended. That was back in March and since then things have been pretty sluggish. I do think that it's a matter of everything settling and the economy settling and saying, we're comfortable again to start traveling again. By no means is Disney World, this vast Tumbleweed Wasteland. It is very crowded, especially during the holidays but I do think that it could definitely use a little love right now. It is a little expensive. That comes with the territory but even though they've had like attendance, maybe the same that it was in 2019, they're generating 40% revenue per capital, higher than they did in 2019. People are paying more, there's premium experiences you can buy to get into the fast pass lane, the old fast lane which is lightning lane now. They do have things to take more money out of you, extract more money out of you, which is what all the other theme park operators do. Disney was just the last one to hop onto that bandwidth."", ""Deidre Woollard: From fast to lightning. They're spending more money on the parks themselves. It sounds like they are doing some investing there. Even as they're trying to save money, they're still investing in the parks."", ""Rick Munarriz: Yeah. I was at Disneyland two weeks ago so I covered both coasts just in this past couple of weeks. Next week I will be at Disney World, so I'm there often. There's a lot of construction activity happening in both parks, both resorts. But Disney said just a couple of months ago that they're going to spend $60 billion in the next decade in capital expenditures for their theme parks and experiences. This includes their cruise ships where they keep expanding their fleet but mostly going into their theme parks and we're seeing that a lot of upgrades are happening. We just had some big upgrades in Asia for the two parks two resorts over there and you're going to see this happen in the US in the next couple of years."", ""Deidre Woollard: I wanted to also talk about, they're taking page out of Netflix's book, there's sharing crackdown. We've heard this from them before, we heard it a lot more this time. They want that same success that Netflix had, they said it's one of these things that gives us confidence in our subscriber growth numbers. They really feel like they can do this. Is it the same thing? Is this an apples to apples comparison in your view?"", ""Rick Munarriz: On the one hand I would say no, Netflix has earned the right. They are the standard cable of streaming services. You have to have Netflix or not you're going to be relevant the next time you're together with friends talking about what they're watching on TV. Disney Plus is not so much that case, but again, if you have a family, you're going to need to watch Blue movie. The reason that a Moana movie is happening in November, they're working on a direct, it was going to be a series going to be on Disney Plus they said, this is coming out so great, we're going to turn it into an actual movie that will come out in November, was because the Moana movie was the most streamed movie on any platform including Netflix in terms of hours viewed in 2023. They have the data on what's important, they are very relevant in that regard. Let them flex their muscles. Netflix again, a lot of people said Netflix is going to suffer when they're cracking down on password sharing and now we've seen a couple of quarters and Netflix is doing just fine. I don't think every service can go ahead and do this, but again, you can't blame them, they're leaving money on the table. If they're letting people do this out of just the goodness of, we need our numbers, we can't churn, we can't have a high turnover rate. At the end of the day, Netflix is proving that we can do this, you can do this too."", ""Deidre Woollard: They tried a lot of things, they tried a lot of things this quarter. It was a great quarter. The market seems to love it so far. One person who didn't love it is Nelson Peltz, the activist investor who's been trying to get on the board and is still trying to get on the board. CNBC reached out to his company after the earnings and they said, we've seen this movie before. I don't know because they have this site called Restore the Badge and they've got these shareholder letters and just is pretty much doing everything that they asked them to do. What do you think they're trying to see here?"", ""Rick Munarriz: They got burned last time. They were going to have the proxy battle talk to Iger and they came to terms, it's all right, we're fine. We like what he's doing, and apparently there wasn't enough for them, so they're launching this other battle. They're going to be a little more skeptical this time around. But again, Disney did everything in this quarter, not so much, just blow out earnings and increase, they could probably have bigger savings than expected but just notice one thing that I think no one ever really talked about, but to me it's very interesting. It was February 7, 2024, and they announced a dividend increase that's going to happen in July. I've never seen a company announce an increase for something that happens five months from now. To me this was them saying, we know our annual shareholder meeting is in April. It is our last time to speak up. We're going to throw everything possible to load this chamber with everything we have. Tell you about that Moana movie in November that no one was expecting, all these other things that are happening. The dividend need is their way of saying, we have this. Again, 45 cents every six months for a stock that's over $100, that's less than 1% yield, a second excite income investors, but I do think it's definitely their way of saying, hey, we came to play with this earnings report and we had enough little stuff in there to please everybody. I don't think that Peltz will be successful this time, but it doesn't mean that he doesn't have good ideas."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah, that's true. Well, thanks for talking to us quickly Rick."", 'Rick Munarriz: Thank you.', ""Deidre Woollard: We talk about a lot of stocks on the show, but it's just a peek at the Motley Fools investing universe.

I spoke with Kirsten Guerra about the business behind the name."", ""We are in Valentine's week mode. It's love season, so people may be sending something special to someone special, but as you may have guessed, it also is a massive week for florists. In fact, I was doing a little digging with the Society of American Florist. It's about 30% of transactions. But we're not going to talk just flowers today, we're going to talk 1-800-Flowers, a ticker FLWS. Kristen, it's the flower company but it's a lot more, right?."", ""Kirsten Guerra: Yeah. The name here is a little deceptive and certainly outdated. Relatively, very few orders still come in through the phone despite the preserved toll free number and the dot com naming is a relic of its 1999 IPO, but it's a brand well known by the name. Today, 1-800-Flowers is only one brand under a much larger umbrella. In 2013, they started talking about what they call the celebratory ecosystem, which is their idea that they wanted to be like the go to place to order all types of gifts online, and that started a long series of acquisitions for them. Some may recognize acquired names like Shari's Berries, Shari's Cookies, things remembered, certainly Harry and David, in some cases, they built and launched a few lines of their own as well. So 1-800-Baskets, simply chocolate, things like that. What all that means to the end consumer is that if you're looking to send someone a gift, you can start on the website of any one of their properties and you're presented with a wide variety of options. Whether that's flowers, fruit baskets, popcorn, little monogrammed, knick-knacks through personalization mall, pastries through Wolferman's bakery, or even seafood through brands like Vital Choice. They've really tried to build out a one stop shop gift giving experience. Of course, they've also got a loyalty program to go along with that, where subscribers can get discounts, early access, free shipping, other benefits like that. In a way that works out for them if they send enough to gifts through the 1-800-Flowers ecosystem and that keeps the dedicated gift givers coming back. So yes, overall, certainly way more than flowers today."", ""Deidre Woollard: Celebratory ecosystem. Not a phrase I've heard before, but I love it."", ""Kirsten Guerra: No, for me I find it to be questionable branding. But it's not something that they sell with. It's just an internal name."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, one of the things that is anxiety provoking about when you're ordering things online is you never know if the picture that you're getting is what the recipient is getting. A lot of times there's that disappointment of like you see this beautiful bouquet or you see this abundant gift basket. Then the person sends you a picture of what they got and you're like, I don't know, but it seems like 1-800-Flowers. They're very into quality control and really delivering what's online, delivering on those expectations. How do they do some of that?"", ""Kirsten Guerra: That really is such an important part of gift delivery like this. Not only that the gift arrives looking how you expect, but also that it arrives exactly when you expect. In the logistics of that, to your point, is actually incredibly complicated. Especially when you consider that people often want to send flowers or gifts right around the same times of year, for example, Valentine's Day. There's an added layer of difficulty when you're telling customers like 1-800-Flowers is, hey, I see you're ordering flowers, would you like to add some chocolate covered strawberries to that? Fortunately, 1-800-Flowers started a heavy investment cycle around 2019 into the back and tech required to make those intelligent cross product suggestions for up cells, making sure that they're in the same warehouses for delivery and things like that. To that point they also revamped their warehouses to be brand agnostic, making it far easier to fulfill those multi-brand bundles and those are really key to the business. When I say multi-brand bundle, you can think like they mentioned actually in their latest earnings call in New Trio for them, which is a bundle of 1-800-Flowers, roses, Harry & David Wine, and Shari's berries chocolate-covered strawberries."", ""That's a multi-bundle or a multi-brand type of purchase. Only 13% of customers purchase multi-brand, but those multi-brand purchases account for 28% of revenue. That's a big area of potential future growth for them. It was critical, it turns out, very timely for them to make those big investments. Topping it off, they also layered on a lot of automation in their distribution center. For example, before they re outfitted one of their largest facilities in Ohio, it could handle around 80,000 packages on a peak day. Remember, peak days are critical for this company. They can generate a substantial amount of revenue, but all concentrated in deliveries that are supposed to go out on the same day, so 80,000 pre-automation and afterward that same facility, could handle 125,000. More than a 40% increase in output just in that one facility. All while cutting labor costs by about a third, which is really an even bigger deal for a company like this that requires a lot of seasonal workers. To your initial point that I think I've strayed from a bit, that automation also really helps ensure the consistent quality in all deliveries and also the quality of the product itself that 1-800-Flowers is really known for."", ""Deidre Woollard: I'm old enough to remember when the CEO, Jim McCann, used to do his 1-800-Flowers commercials on TV. I don't think he does that anymore. He was the CEO, he's now the CEO. Again, tell us a little bit about the McCann's because this is a family business."", ""Kirsten Guerra: Yeah. I don't think I've seen those commercials recently, but I have seen some of the old versions from the '90s and around that time. Jim McCann, a well known name and actually when I first mentioned this to Tim Buyers, he recognized him immediately from those commercials. But he founded the company under the name 1-800-Flowers back in 1995. He served as CEO then. He's still CEO today. But as you mentioned, there was there was some change there. Technically, his brother Chris McCann actually took over as CEO in 2016 and ran the company until last year in 2023 when he needed to step away for some personal health reasons. Now it's back with founder and CEO again, Jim McCann. One way or another, this has always been a family business between the two of them they still own 47% of the company. Of course, most of that with Jim McCann, who owns 45% of it nearly 30 years after founding it, which is very impressive that he's managed to hang onto so much of the business."", ""Deidre Woollard: He's very, very passionate about it. In the earnings, it's definitely clear that he's very identified with it."", ""Kirsten Guerra: Yeah, absolutely. This is his whole life, and he's done very well with it clearly."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, thinking about 1-800-Flowers in the whole business in general, there's been some consumer weakness in recent quarters with the business. Some of that might be reduced corporate giving. This the year of efficiency that has, a lot of companies have cut back on all sorts of things. But when you're looking at this company, how tightly tied do you think it is to the economy, to the ways that we spend, or do we just always have to give something if it's Valentine's Day or if it's Mother's Day. If you don't do it, you're going to be in trouble."", ""Kirsten Guerra: Yes. That's what I'm told. Flowers are considered an ephemeral gift, that's what they call them. They can't be used, they can't be consumed. That means that they are typically the first gift class that most people cut in tougher economic times. But as we've talked about 1-800-Flowers has diversified into a lot of other gift options. In fact, today, more than half of their revenue actually, comes from gourmet food and gift baskets. Roughly the other half comes from flowers, but still technically not as much from flowers today. That diversification in the steady stream of acquisitions over the years means that revenue at least has historically climbed every year, except through the great financial crisis, despite potential fluctuations in demand. Revenue did finally drop again in 2023, breaking that trend again amid economic pressure. But 1-800-Flowers talks about this. They break their revenue down into what they would call holidays in every day buckets, and they continue to see strong demand in the holidays category. To your question, yes, the gift giving pressure, especially around the holidays, will probably always exist and that adds some real stability to the business. More of the revenue fluctuation comes from the every day category. Which might be, for example, me sending you a thank you stake for having me on the podcast that's not necessarily recurring. But it's a one off I may feel compelled to send. Of course, the nature of that type of gift giving is always harder to predict and disappears quicker under economic pressure. But potentially has more room for upside as well. Because there's just more potential there."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, I'm curious a little bit about their membership thing. It sounds almost like a prime for gift givers. Is that the idea is to make a more steady revenue stream by encouraging people to send gifts for any reason at all?"", ""Kirsten Guerra: Yeah, I think that's the goal to add a little bit of recurring revenue, but maybe more so the ecosystem aspect, to have that competitive advantage where if you have, it's a little bit of sunk cost to a consumer. If you've already paid the upfront fee, which, oh, don't quote me offhand, I think it was like $20 or something. But if I've already paid that to get into the system, then the next time I'm thinking of sending flowers or sending a gift basket, I'm going to be compelled to go right back to 1-800-Flowers. Because not only have I bought into that system, I'm going to get free delivery on that next order. Maybe I also have some discount or coupon that they've given to me to come back to them and keep staying with them. I think it's more the ecosystem more than anything. But it seems to be working."", ""Deidre Woollard: I'm sure they email you frequently [laughs] to remind you to do it."", ""Kirsten Guerra: Yes, I have had to block them because as you know, I did do an order to just, as I was looking into this as a recommendation, I made an order just to test all of the things I've mentioned, the automation facilities, and see how they worked through all of that and they did well. But yes, there are a lot of emails that come with it around holidays, certainly reminding me to come right back to them."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, thinking about this as an investment, this is a company. It's being going through some stuff. You mentioned the investment in automation and in the warehouses there's signs of improvement which is great. Company probably doesn't have to do a lot to impress shareholders at this point because those expectations have been down and it's been trading at some low price to book value and price to sales multiples. You mentioned the quarter revenue was still down. They lowered their revenue guidance down to I think, seven to 9% for the year. What should we be looking at here?"", ""Kirsten Guerra: It's been very cheap recently based on how I valued the business at least. That's one of the benefits to having the outdated name and very few analysts that are following the business. There's not a lot of people looking at this. When there's not a lot of expectation baked in as you said, they don't have to do a lot to impress shareholders. Overall, the main goals of 1-800-Flowers as a company right now and what investors should really be looking for from them is a return to normal more than anything. We want to see the dissipation of economic pressure that's weighed on the top line. Hopefully see more of those everyday purchases come back and we want to see their gross margins return to historical levels for this company, which is around 41%. That fell to 37% recently with rises in freight costs and all the fluctuating commodity costs that we talked about, but they've already built that back to 39%. I actually started first looking at this company last year, when both the company's CFO and its president took money out of their own pockets to buy shares on the open market, where the CFO actually upped his stake by more than 12%."", ""That's a pretty clear sign that these insiders at least feel confident that their business is being significantly undervalued. Now I will say they bought at an average share price closer to $6 at the time. Right around the time of this recording, I think it's around 10. It's something to be aware of. But I would say that if they can manage to not only return to business as usual, which is the current goal, but also really leverage all of those tech in fulfillment investments to encourage more multi-brand bundles, attract more consistent gift givers into their loyalty program, and push further into corporate gift giving as you mentioned then, potentially it's still quite fairly valued at this point."", ""Deidre Woollard: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. I'm Deidre Woollard. Thanks for listening.

Although lower demand normally contributes to easing pump prices, higher oil prices counteracted that pressure and ushered in the higher cost of gas, according to AAA.', 'The national average is now more expensive than a year ago for the first time since December, putting hopes of a $3 average well out of reach. Gas prices had been declining between September 2023 and January of this year to a one-year low of $3.07 before snapping that streak. The last time the national average gas price fell below $3 was in May 2021.', '""Most years see a greater seasonal advance than what has occurred so far this year,"" OPIS head of energy analysis Tom Kloza wrote Yahoo Finance in an email.

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be made available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the call via dial-in or on our Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.', ""Steve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q."", ""Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, February 13, 2024. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin."", 'Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full-year results driven by the success of our diverse portfolio across markets and species, game-changing innovation, and the outstanding commitment of our purpose-driven colleagues. We delivered 7% operational revenue growth, growing faster than the industry, propelled by steady demand for innovative products that enable our customers and the animals they care for to thrive. With the ongoing momentum of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis or OA pain, we saw segment growth of 6% of the US and 9% operational growth internationally. Our companion animal portfolio remains a key growth driver, up 8% operationally, and we saw a return to growth for our livestock portfolio, up 6% operationally.', ""While we continue to operate in an environment of global uncertainty, our diversity across markets, species, and therapeutic areas, has sustained our performance, further demonstrating that animal health is a durable, essential, and growing industry. Our track record of innovation, from pioneering breakthroughs to product lifecycle enhancements, has solidified our position as the industry leader, consistently growing above the market and enables us to create market-leading franchises. We don't just follow trends, we make markets. The launch of Librela and Solensia, the first two injectable monoclonal antibodies for the alleviation of osteoarthritis, is fundamentally improving the quality of life for dogs and cats, and strengthening the human-animal bond."", ""That's why today Librela remains the number one selling OA pain product in Europe. At Investor Day last May, and again at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, I shared that our own pain franchise could have peak sales exceeding $1 billion, and we are excited about Librela's performance since its US launch in October, which reaffirms that view. Due to high clinic penetration, we've activated our direct-to-consumer or DTC efforts faster than any other product in our history, which we expect to provide a tailwind for commercial growth. Similarly, Solensia has also been well received, with strong clinic penetration around the world, with increased opportunity as we generate more awareness of OA pain in cats. Within our dermatology franchise, we've established ourselves as the trusted partner to veterinarians, and after nearly a decade of impressive growth, we still believe we have room to expand this market."", ""Increasing pet owner's awareness that itch is a medical condition that requires treatment, improved compliance, and the opportunity to address even more unmet needs, underpins our optimism. We remain confident that we can sustain growth thanks to our differentiated products like Cytopoint and Apoquel chewable, the first and only chewable treatment for the control of allergic itch and inflammation in dogs. Our parasiticides portfolio, and particularly Simparica Trio, remains a key growth driver, even in the face of increasing competition. This continued success highlights our strategic execution, label strength, and the efficacy of our products. The performance across our key product franchises not only reinforces our market-leading position, but also better innovation consistently meet the evolving demands in veterinary medicine."", ""As we begin in 2024, we will stay disciplined and adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop around the world, and focus on executing our plans and continuing to grow faster than the market. Two durable global trends give us confidence in that future growth, the powerful human-animal bond, and the world's growing need for a sustainable supply of animal protein. Our commitment to operational excellence ensures we are ready to scale to meet those demands and navigate unforeseen challenges, while delivering shareholder value. Looking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance. Our dedication to innovation remains the cornerstone of our market-leading position. We've consistently demonstrated agility, outpacing the market to bring groundbreaking solutions that meet and exceed customer expectations."", ""We will continue to leverage that advantage and we're guiding to a range of 7% to 9% operational revenue growth in 2024, and adjusted net income growth in the range of 9% to 11% operationally, which reflects our ongoing investments in R&D, supply chains, and commercial excellence, to cultivate new markets, drive growth, and create value. As you've heard me say time and time again, we are confident in our strategy, portfolio, pipeline, and capabilities to deliver value to shareholders and customers, while performing above the market. Our focus positions us well to navigate potential challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. In closing, we'll continue our relentless pursuit to exceed customer expectations and invest in advancing the capabilities that differentiate Zoetis."", ""As we look to 2024, I could not be more excited about our future. Our key growth drivers will continue to showcase our commitment to nurturing the world and humankind by advancing care for animals, and our ongoing innovations will expand the market, reaffirm our best-in-class product portfolio, and defend our position amid competition. I want to reiterate the four tenets of our value proposition discussed on Investor Day. We will grow revenue faster than the market. We will invest in innovation and growth capabilities. We commit to growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, and we'll return excess capital to shareholders. While there is need and demand to improve the quality of life for animals, Zoetis will continue leading the way and setting the standard for performance and growth."", 'This is core to our vision, to be the most trusted and valued animal health company, shaping the future of animal care through innovation, customer obsession, and purpose-driven colleagues. Thank you. Now, let me hand it over to Wetteny. Wetteny?', 'Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong year in 2023, with revenue of $8.5 billion and adjusted net income of $2.5 billion. Our full-year revenue was near the top end of our guidance range, while our adjusted net income was slightly below our guidance range, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange, as well as an impairment charge related to a prior acquisition. Our revenue growth was broad, with strong growth across both our US and international segments, both our companion animal and livestock portfolios, and due to both price and volume. Full-year revenue grew 6% on a reported basis and 7% operationally, with adjusted net income anchoring 7% on both a reported and operational basis.', 'Of the 7% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, Librela, and Solensia, as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio. On a segment basis, our US business posted $4.6 billion in revenue, growing 6% on the year, while our international segment reported revenue of $3.9 billion, with operational growth of 9% on the full year. Additionally, while China represents less than 5% of our global revenues, the ongoing economic weakness there continues to impact our business, and represented a half a percentage point drag on our total company operational revenue growth for the year, entirely in volume. Our full-year growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 8% operationally.', 'Our livestock portfolio also had a strong year, with operational growth of 6%. Performance in companion animal was led by OA pain mAbs, which posted $321 million in global revenue for the year. Growth came from first wave European markets, as well as from the impact of new launch markets in 2023, including the US. We continue to see penetration of our pain mAbs grow within vet clinics, and a high level of satisfaction amongst both vets and pet owners. Our key dermatology products generated $1.4 billion in sales globally, posting strong growth of 8% for the year on an operational basis. Simparica Trio contributed global revenue of $813 million in 2023, representing growth of 9% operationally, despite distributor inventory headwinds in Q1 and aggressive competitive promotions for much of the year.', 'Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $356 million in revenue and grew 7% operational, with growth contributions from both the US and international. Our livestock portfolio had a strong year, with 6% operational revenue growth, driven by both price and volume. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2.2 billion, representing an increase of 8% on both a reported and operational basis, posting our third consecutive quarter of at least 8% operational revenue growth despite a tough comparative, particularly in US companion animal. Adjusted net income of $569 million is an increase of 6% on both a reported and an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 6% is from price and 2% is on volume.', 'Volume growth consisted of 4% growth from new products and a 2% decline in our inline products. Volume from our key dermatology products was flat in the quarter. On a segment basis, our US business posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 9% on the quarter, while our international segment reported revenue of $982 million, with operational growth of 8% on the quarter. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in the quarter, growing 10% operationally. Livestock also contributed, with operational growth of 6%. We saw double-digit companion animal growth in both our US and our international segments, driven by our innovative products. Our OA pain mAbs were the primary driver of growth, posting $124 million in combined revenue in the quarter.', 'Global growth came primarily from the impact of new launch markets, bolstered by the Q4 full launch of Librela in the US. Simparica Trio generated $208 million globally in the quarter, representing growth of 21% operationally. Price was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, followed by volume growth, driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally, as well as from increased field force focus. Our key dermatology products generated $375 million in sales globally, posting growth of 7% on an operational basis. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded revenue of $87 million and grew 8% operationally, with growth contributions from both the US and international. Our livestock products ended the year on a strong note, with growth of 6% operationally, growing in both our US and international segments.', 'Growth was driven equally by price, which grew despite headwinds from drags in price decreases, as well as by volume, with growth in Synovex from our expanded label claims. Now, moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. US revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 9%, with companion animal sales growing 10%, and livestock sales growing 4%. Companion animal again posted double-digit growth in the quarter, bolstered by the full launch of Librela at the start of the quarter, all while facing a tough comparative quarter with promotional activity and heavier than normal pre-price buying at the end of last year. In the US, vet clinic visits were flat on the quarter and flat for the year, while we continue to see solid clinical revenue and revenue per visit, growth of 6% for the quarter and 7.5% for the year.', ""Our US companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace veterinary clinic revenue growth due in part to our innovative therapeutics, as well as our strong presence in the retail channel. Moving on to product performance, growth in the US was driven by our pain mAbs, Simparica Trio, and our key dermatology portfolio. Our combined pain mAbs posted $58 million in US sales in Q4. We moved to a full launch of Librela in the US early in the fourth quarter, and we have been pleased with the results our field force has been able to drive thus far. Librela posted $44 million in US sales in the quarter, which is at the higher end of our initial expectations. It's important to note that while we are not leveraging distribution for our pain mAbs, there's a significant clinic stocking impact in the first few months after launch."", 'We have seen higher than expected penetration and reorder rates through the end of the year, as well as rapid patient share growth in the canine pain category. Solensia had sales of $14 million in Q4 in the US. We have seen a marked increase in feline vet visits and feline revenue growth in the clinic. In the US, feline OA patients are up 23% for 2023. Simparica Trio posted US sales of $185 million in the quarter, growing 17%. Growth was driven primarily by price as we were in promotions in Q4 of 2022 following our Q3 2022 supply challenges, and in advance of a then expected competitor launch in early 2023. In our second quarter, with competition in the triple combination space, we continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio. We remain confident in our ability to compete and grow in this space through the strength of our label, retail channel presence, strong corporate and specialty relationships, and the significant advantage of being first to market.', '(Indiscernible) dermatology product sales in the US were $252 million in the quarter, growing 6%. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth through both price and volume, with vet and pet owners referring its injectable method of administration. (Operational) franchise growth is driven by better net price realization on lower volume due to promotional activity at the end of last year. Our US companion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 9% in the quarter. US livestock grew 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by growth in poultry as a result of favorable rotations back to certain medicated feed additives and the extended use of Zoamix, as well as share gain due to competitor supply constraints. Sales of both swine and cattle products increased in the quarter, primarily as a result of increased supply of vaccines that were limited in the same quarter of the prior year.', 'Moving on to our international segment where revenue in the quarter grew 9% on a reported basis and 8%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. International companion animal grew 10% operationally, and livestock grew 7% operationally. China represented a 3% drag on our international segment operational revenue growth in the quarter. Higher sales in companion animal products was led by our pain mAbs, our key dermatology products, and our small animal parasiticides portfolio. Growth in our OA pain products was equally driven by sales force focus and DTC awareness campaigns in early launching European markets, as well as continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year. Librela sales were $53 million internationally or 93% operational growth in the quarter.', 'Solensia sales were $13 million internationally in the quarter, growing 77% operationally. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $123 million in revenue, posting growth of 10% in the quarter on an operational basis. We continue to see benefit to Apoquel from our DTC awareness campaigns across several international markets and conversion to Apoquel chewable has been positive. Growth in Cytopoint continues to benefit from higher rates of conversion from Apoquel and overall market growth. Our international small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 4% operationally, driven by our Simparica franchise, with Simparica posting $48 million in revenue and growing 32% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven primarily by price, a strong parasiticide season, and demand generation in emerging markets.', 'Simparica Trio contributed $23 million internationally, growing 72% operationally, driven by high peak season sales in Australia and continued uptake in Europe, driven by key account penetration and field force effectiveness. This growth was partially offset by a 33% operational decline in our Revolution franchise, which generates a high proportion of sales in China where we had a tough comparative quarter due to the return of supply in Q4 of 2022, as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions. Continuing on to international livestock, which was 7% operationally, driven primarily by price increases in all species, especially in high inflationary markets. Our poultry portfolio also benefited from favorable MFA rotations in certain markets.', 'China had an unfavorable impact on our international livestock sales in the quarter, particularly in our swine portfolio. Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L, for the quarter adjusted gross margins of 67.1% decreased 100 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. On an operational basis, adjusted gross margins decreased by 20 basis points, resulting primarily from higher manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by price increases and lower freight costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which grew 10% operationally, primarily due to higher competition-related expenses, as well as a charitable contribution related to the funding of the Zoetis Foundation.', 'R&D expenses grew 17% on an operational basis, driven by higher compensation-related expenses, as well as portfolio progression of key pipeline projects. Finally, other income and deductions were higher in the quarter due to an impairment charge related to an acquisition. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, a decrease of 200 basis points, primarily due to higher net discrete tax benefits in the quarter, a higher benefit in the US related to foreign derived intangible income, and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. Adjusted net income grew 6% operationally, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $198 million. For the full year, we had capital expenditures of $732 million.', 'Lastly, we continue to return excess capital to shareholders. For the year, we have returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of share purchases and dividends. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase, continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. Now, moving on to our guidance for the full year of 2024. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact on our growth versus the prior year. At net revenue, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact our growth by 90 basis points, with the impact being more pronounced early in the year and decreasing later in the year.', 'At adjusted net income, we expect FX to negatively impact our growth by 150 basis points, with significant unfavorable impact in the first half of the year, transitioning to slight favorability in the second half of the year. As a reminder, we do not actively forecast FX, so these estimates assume rates remain where they were as of late January. For 2024, we are projecting revenue between $9.075 billion and $9.225 billion, representing a range of 7% to 9% operational growth, with growth across both price and volume. We expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2024. With the expected impact of the US launch of Librela, we expect to see robust growth from our OA pain mAbs, both in the US and internationally. Our current clinic penetration levels for Librela in the US are exceeding our expectations, and as Kristin mentioned, we have launched our DTC efforts ahead of schedule to drive increased pet owner awareness.', ""Even with the expectation of competitive entrance, we anticipate mid to high single-digit growth in both Simparica Trio and our key dermatology portfolio. For livestock, 2023 exceeded our expectations. Our growth in the year benefited from several tailwinds, including improvements in supply in certain markets, as well as competitive out of stocks. While our outlook for the upcoming year is more optimistic than it was as we entered 2023, we do expect our growth rate to normalize and be in line with livestock industry growth. I'd like to briefly touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth. For companion animal, we are not projecting significant change to the current vet clinic trends. We expect US visits to grow flat to 1%, and expect to see growth in therapeutic visits aided by the impact of our OA pain products."", 'For our companion animal parasiticides, we continue to expect meaningful growth from Simparica Trio. We expect new entrants will help continue to drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination of our parasiticides, a space where we are the market leader. In our key dermatology products, we are prepared for competition and confident in our ability to defend and grow our share through our three differentiated dermatology products, the strength of our customer relationships, and the expertise we have gained from almost 10 years in the space. Lastly, while we are not assuming a change in the current economic situation in China, we do expect a headwind to growth, especially in the first half as the situation worsened over the course of 2023.', 'Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29.5%. We continue to make investments to ensure we can support expected future growth in our portfolio, especially in monoclonal antibodies. These investments are driving short-term margin impacts from lower site utilization. This is offset by price increases and favorable product mix. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.17 billion and $2.22 billion, with the increase from 2023 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2024 is expected to be between $665 million and $675 million. Spend is driven by the advancement of key pipeline projects, as well as higher compensation-related expenses.', 'Adjusted interest expense and other income and deductions is expected to be approximately $210 million. This is significantly higher than the prior year as our growth here is negatively impacted by the non-recurring royalty settlement income we reflected in Q1 of 2023, as well as the impact of lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted in income is expected to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.70 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 11%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.74 to $.584, and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44.', 'And finally, we are anticipating capital expenditures in 2024 to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. These levels remain elevated compared to historical spend levels as we continue to make investments to support our future growth. To summarize, 2023 was another strong year. Even with distributor inventory headwinds entering the year and a challenging economic environment, especially in China, we again outperformed the market. We continue to grow share even in spaces where we face new competition, and we remain confident in our ability to expand existing markets and create new ones in the future. As we move into 2024, our guidance highlights our ability to again grow faster than the market, driven by our innovative product portfolio and multiple sources of growth, as well as our ability to grow our bottom line faster than our pipeline, while making meaningful investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders.', ""Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.

The central bank is expected to trim interest rates several times this year, a key move that should help the stock market scale northward. After all, rate cuts boost consumer outlays, increase business investments, and help the economy chug along.', ""However, January's inflation figures have compelled investors to scale back bets on a May rate cut, with experts expecting that there is only a 36.7% chance that the Fed will trim interest rates by a quarter-point, per the CME FedWatch tool.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.', 'Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.', 'Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system\'s ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.', ""One stock to keep an eye on is Synchrony Financial (SYF). SYF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 6.56 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 12.58. Over the past 52 weeks, SYF's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.45 and as low as 5.20, with a median of 6.30."", ""Investors should also note that SYF holds a PEG ratio of 0.90. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. SYF's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.31. Within the past year, SYF's PEG has been as high as 1.78 and as low as 0.29, with a median of 1.40."", ""Investors should also recognize that SYF has a P/B ratio of 1.21. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 2.14. Over the past 12 months, SYF's P/B has been as high as 1.37 and as low as 0.87, with a median of 1.09."", ""Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. SYF has a P/S ratio of 0.77. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.66."", ""Finally, we should also recognize that SYF has a P/CF ratio of 5.97. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. SYF's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 13.81. Over the past year, SYF's P/CF has been as high as 6.13 and as low as 3.66, with a median of 4.67."", ""These are only a few of the key metrics included in Synchrony Financial's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now.

Yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, are commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount."", 'However, while not taking into account the growth potential of a stock, these ratios might end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show. This might often lead to ""value traps"" — a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems, which once pulled down the share price, turn out to be persistent.', 'In such a case, even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value, you might still end up paying more.

Drivers could see sharper increases in the weeks ahead.', '“This is the time of year we normally see pump prices start to rise,” Andrew Gross, a AAA spokesperson, said in a statement on March 14. “And while prices have been rather pokey so far, they should begin to accelerate and move higher very soon.”', 'GasBuddy head of petroleum analysis Patrick De Haan told Yahoo Finance Live in late February he sees gas prices rising another $0.20 to $0.50 per gallon by Memorial Day as ""seasonal ups and downs"" come into view.', ""While some of the disruptions from COVID-19 and the initial shocks from Russia's invasion of Ukraine dissipate, other catalysts could support higher oil prices — and, therefore, gas prices — as the summer draws nearer."", 'Last week, gas demand decreased slightly to 8.81 million barrels per day from 9.04 million barrels the week before. Although lower demand normally contributes to easing pump prices, higher oil prices counteracted that pressure and ushered in the higher cost of gas, according to AAA.', 'The national average is now more expensive than a year ago for the first time since December, putting hopes of a $3 average well out of reach. Gas prices had been declining between September 2023 and January of this year to a one-year low of $3.07 before snapping that streak.

Brent and WTI have gained about $10 per barrel since the start of the year.', 'The OPEC+ announced earlier this month it is extending production cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day through the second quarter, which sent oil prices higher.', 'Geopolitical risks have also put upward pressure on prices. Escalating Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries led several oil facilities to suspend operations, sending global crude prices higher.', 'And ongoing attacks against vessels in the Red Sea by the Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel group, have become a wild card for oil prices in 2024. The attacks by Houthi rebels have prompted energy and shipment companies to avoid the Red Sea region that connects to the Suez Canal, a critical pathway between Asia and Europe.', '""I think right now the Middle East is something we continue to watch, though there hasn\'t been much impact [on oil prices],"" De Haan said. ""The Middle East could certainly change. We\'ve seen situations where things drastically change overnight, and of course, there\'s a lot of crude oil being produced in the Middle East.""', ""At the same time, crude oil prices aren't the only factor driving gas prices.

Give me your sort of snapshot based on what we've heard from the companies before. Tough to make the comparison to the revenge travel that we saw last year but maybe not as bad as some people expected."", ""RONALD JOSEY: Yeah. No, Akiko, I think you're right. It's a challenging time now, because we're coming off of 4Q where from what we heard, October was a challenge given the conflict in the Middle East, but then you heard Airbnb talk about accelerating growth in November and December."", ""You heard Expedia say that, you know, Vrbo continues to be somewhat challenged as they migrate to the new platform yet by and large, it seems as if consumer travel trends remain healthy. Unemployment is better or is where it is, and, you know, the big question we get constantly is we heard about the summer travel in '22, would that repeat in '23?"", ""The answer was yes. The question is, does that repeat in '24? And frankly, I don't see any signs that would suggest otherwise and so it seems to me that the market is healthy. We do have some challenging comps overall. Everyone has already taken the trip, but when you have unemployment where it is and when you have, sort of, consumer confidence as high as it is, I actually think travel will be just fine this year."", 'And 4Q was a little messy because of the October-- the conflict in the Middle East and 1Q gets a little bit messy, because Easter is early on in the year, but by and large, it seems like travel trends are holding up relatively well.', ""AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, so let's talk about some strategy here. I mean, Booking Holdings, your top pick, still waiting for those results to come through. But is it about scale when you think about where to put your money in what is expected to be continued momentum in the travel space?"", ""Booking is one of those that's got sort of a presence across the stack."", ""RONALD JOSEY: Yeah, I know. I mean, within the online travel sub vertical, if you will, Booking is our top pick followed by Airbnb. Bigger picture, we love meta. We love Amazon. We love Uber as well, so we can talk about those.

(NYSE:BAX) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 1st of April, with investors receiving $0.29 per share. This means the annual payment is 2.8% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Baxter International ', ""A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Baxter International is not generating a profit, but its free cash flows easily cover the dividend, leaving plenty for reinvestment in the business. We generally think that cash flow is more important than accounting measures of profit, so we are fairly comfortable with the dividend at this level."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 144.6%. If the dividend continues on its recent course, the company could be paying out several times what it earns in the next 12 months, which could start applying pressure to the balance sheet.', ""Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.80 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.16. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 4.3% per year. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Baxter International's EPS has fallen by approximately 50% per year during the past five years. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise.

Where the S&P 500 might land in the next six months is anyone's guess. However, over a decade, major indexes tend to move steadily in the right direction and deliver competitive returns. That makes investing in stocks an excellent option for people looking to build their wealth over time."", ""Throwing money at any random corporation won't do, though. It's essential to pick wisely. With that out of the way, let's consider two excellent healthcare companies that could be top picks for the next 10 years: Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) and Sanofi (NASDAQ: SNY)."", ""Medical device giant Medtronic hasn't performed well in the past few years. It has struggled with slow revenue growth, pandemic-related disruptions, and economic issues. However, it would be a mistake to dismiss a company with a track record like Medtronic so easily. It has been navigating the challenging and highly regulated healthcare industry for decades, routinely developing newer and better medical devices while surviving difficult economic conditions."", ""While the past is no guarantee of future success, Medtronic's underlying business still boasts the qualities that allowed it to thrive for this long. Furthermore, the company is changing things around to improve its performance. Medtronic is getting rid of its low-growth patient monitoring and respiratory intervention unit. The company is doubling down on areas with higher growth potential, such as its diabetes care segment."", ""In the second quarter of its fiscal 2024, ended on Oct. 27, 2023, Medtronic's diabetes care unit reported revenue of $610 million, 9.7% higher than the year-ago period. If that doesn't sound like a lot, note that its total revenue of $8 billion increased by just 5.3%. None of the company's other major segments beat diabetes care in terms of revenue growth. This is partly due to the continued adoption of its MiniMed 780G, an innovative insulin pump that helps keep glucose levels in check. The MiniMed 780G was only launched in the U.S. last year, so there is more room for growth."", 'Elsewhere, Medtronic is increasingly applying artificial intelligence to improve its products, efforts that could prove highly lucrative down the line.

The company is currently on its 46th consecutive year of dividend hikes -- since 1978, its dividend per share has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 16%.

The drugmaker's top line increased by just 5.3% year over year to 43.1 billion euros ($46.4 billion), while it reported net earnings per share of 8.11 euros ($8.70), down almost 2% compared to the fiscal 2022. However, the company made significant clinical and regulatory progress last year."", ""First, it earned approval for Beyfortus, one of the first vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus to hit the market. Sanofi also launched a brand-new hemophilia medicine called Altuviiio. On the clinical front, the company reported positive results for its biggest growth driver, Dupixent, in treating COPD. This additional indication should substantially improve Dupixent's already fast-growing sales."", ""There is more going on with Sanofi. Last year, it announced that it would spin off its consumer healthcare business, a move that's become pretty popular among pharmaceutical giants in recent years. The transaction should be complete by the fourth quarter. Sanofi wants to double down on its core biopharmaceutical operations. The move should help the biotech push important programs through the pipeline."", ""Sanofi expects at least five new investigational vaccines -- one of its best-performing segments in the past few years -- to enter late-stage studies by next year.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today. I\'m pleased to report that during the fourth quarter, ALC generated record quarterly revenues of $717 million, up approximately 19% relative to the same quarter last year, and we achieved $1.89 in diluted earnings per share, up 56% from last year\'s fourth quarter. Revenue for the full year of $2.7 billion was also an ALC record. Strong continued expansion of our fleet, increased sales activity at healthy gains and higher end of lease revenue were the primary drivers of upside to revenue as compared to the prior year quarter. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 22 new aircraft from our order book, adding approximately $1.2 billion in flight equipment to our balance sheet, while we sold 8 aircraft totaling approximately $440 million in sales proceeds. The utilization rate on our fleet remains very strong at 99.9% for the full year 2023. In addition to revenue expansion during the fourth quarter, we also benefited from approximately $67 million net from the insurance settlement we received on 4 aircraft (inaudible) in Russia in the prior year, plus the equity interest in our managed fleet. We continue to vigorously pursue further insurance settlements as well as our insurance claims and litigation, but given these are largely legal matters, there\'s not a lot of extra color we can add on this topic. I will note that we believe strongly in the validity of our claims and continue to pursue all available options for recovery. Global air traffic continues to gain altitude and there are no signs on the horizon of volumes weakening dramatically. Steve will expand upon this in his remarks. We\'re also seeing in recent months a rebound in the cargo and air freight markets, owing largely to cargo ship traffic risk, time delays and concerns from the Middle East. We believe that this uptick in airfreight trend will continue given geopolitical realities in the Middle East. This bodes well for our order of 7 A350 freighter aircraft as does further and impending additional orders for the A350 freighter from airlines such as Cathay Pacific. Demand for fuel-efficient aircraft, meanwhile continues to be very strong across both new and used aircraft. At present, we are 100% placed in our forward orders through 2025, and we placed 65% of our into order book. Given Boeing and Airbus are practically sold out through the end of this decade, and that we have $22 billion of deliveries pending through 2028, which will likely slip into 2029 as well, we are being patient with additional order book placements to further bolster the upward trend in lease rates you\'ve heard us regularly highlighting. These delivery slots hold immense value, and we\'re very cognizant of the position of strength we\'re in. As to our current fleet, we are taking advantage of the market lease rate increases on our lease extensions, although we do not have a high number of lease expirations or extensions this year. We are still experiencing a very high rate of lease extensions as most airlines are anxious to keep their aircraft given the short supply of aircraft. Used wide-body lease rates, including A330-200 and 300 and Boeing 777-300ERs are accelerating from the supply-demand imbalance with single-aisle 737-800s and A320 and 321 CEOs, reaping the highest premiums for prior generation aircraft in the used aircraft marketplace. During the fourth quarter, our $1.2 billion of deliveries came in higher as compared to our expectations for the quarter and for the full year deliveries came in at $4.6 billion. As you may recall, third quarter deliveries were lighter than expected. So some of the pickup in the fourth quarter came from those delivering, while others that we thought might push into 2025 were brought forward into December. Looking forward, the supply of new commercial aircraft remains highly constrained both by the supply chain as well as aircraft and engine production quality issues. Delivery volumes have improved over the past couple of years following the pandemic, but challenges persist around the pace of improvement and the ability of both Boeing and Airbus to ramp up and achieve production goals. The recent action by the FAA to limit Boeing\'s MAX production rate is a main reason why we at ALC are forecasting a relatively wide range in our 2024 new aircraft investments of between $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion. Prior year\'s history also provides some uncertainty on our total Airbus deliveries for 2024. We expect around $1 billion of those deliveries to occur in the first quarter of 2024. That said, I do think it\'s important to point out that at the low end of the range, deliveries would provide significant fleet growth, representing approximately 17% of ALC\'s 2023 year-end fleet which would be even higher after aircraft sales and depreciation are taken into account. We are continuing to see lease rates catch up with interest rates in the marketplace. As to the impact on lease yields, let me remind you that the increase in lease rates we are seeing on new placements will primarily benefit our results in subsequent years as our new aircraft placements generally occur 2 years prior to delivery. Our aircraft sales activity remained healthy in the fourth quarter, and we continue to see strong sales demand for our aircraft. Important to highlight in our business is the fact that the earnings cycle on every aircraft is not complete until it\'s sold. So earning a healthy gain on exit is a critical part of the investment cycle as well and bolsters our profit margins and return on equity. Healthy gains also demonstrate the value of our strategy of purchasing aircraft at the best possible prices from the OEMs. ALC sales pipeline totals $1.5 billion as of today, inclusive of roughly $600 million of aircraft classified as held for sale and $900 million subject to letters of intent. As for 2024 sales expectations, we currently anticipate approximately $1.5 billion of aircraft sales. As a reminder, the sales proceeds from letter of intent to deal closure takes time and is dependent on a number of factors outside of our control, so sales volumes tend to be lumpy in any given quarter as a result. Based on sales activity so far this quarter, we would expect closing around $200 million in sales for the first quarter of 2024. Now switching gears to a different topic. There has been much publicity and commentary on the recent Alaska 737-9 MAX incident along with Boeing quality control and regulatory oversight. Let me just say that ALC is a believer and supporter of the 737 MAX and of the Boeing Company. We are keenly aware of Boeing\'s intense 24/7 efforts to rectify and address quality controls, enhanced safety measures and restore confidence of the flying public, their customers worldwide and the regulators. We fully believe that Boeing will be successful in these efforts and will be a better company for it. The 737 MAX is a core component of global airline fleets and will remain so. We do not believe that the MAX residual value is diminished whatsoever. We continue to see very strong lease demand for the MAX as well as high demand from buyers for the MAX. We\'re also encouraged by Airbus\' perspective on the Alaska 9 MAX matter, with Guillaume Faury recently commenting that ""makes us very humble."" it is a strong reminder to all OEMs and suppliers to always put quality and safety first, never at the expense of production rate or economic goals. We all want our aircraft on time, but without compromise on quality. Quality and safety must take precedence over all other considerations. So while extremely unfortunate, we believe the Alaska-9 MAX incident serves as a reminder to all OEMs and their related supply chains as to what is most important. In closing, let me just summarize that the dynamic of strong aircraft demand, constrained supply and ample fleet growth is a robust and prevailing tailwind for our business here at Air Lease. And we see these factors offering continued support for aircraft values and lease rates for the foreseeable future. As such, we see a strong flight path ahead for our business. Now I\'ll turn the call over to Steve Hazy, who will add some additional commentary. Steve?', 'Steven F. Udvar-Hazy', ""Thank you, John, and thank you to all of you listening in on the Air Lease call today. I'd like to begin by congratulating from deep in my heart the Air Lease team on achieving several key records, including the highest revenue and sales proceeds as well as exceeding $30 billion in assets for the first time in our history. We've certainly come a long way from our start in 2010, when we had aspirations, but no aircraft and only a handful of employees. ALC was built from our collective vision that airlines will require the newest technology, fuel-efficient commercial aircraft for lease and that these aircraft will be needed well ahead of any availability from the OEMs.Right now, we're observing both of these trends in a position that has rarely been so positively skewed in our favor. Airlines are immense need for the highest demand new aircraft. And both Boeing and Airbus are practically sold out through the end of this decade. Our volume discount pricing on our fleet and order book was achieved well before the recent spike in industry orders and pricing and gives us a tremendous advantage that few others possess. These factors also continued to support positive upside to lease rates and aircraft values in our fleet. Global airline traffic volumes remain very robust. Full year 2023 IATA traffic figures released earlier this month continue to show very strong expansion with total volumes rising 37% year-over-year. Domestic traffic was up 30%. And for example, domestic China, in particular, up significant 147% versus the prior year. And most markets rose at a very healthy pace. In fact, global domestic traffic hit all new highs in December with several markets like the U.S., India, Australia and Brazil, achieving mid- to high single-digit year-over-year growth rates in the month. Total international volume meanwhile, rose a substantial 42% for the year, with all major markets rising at double-digit growth rates relative to 2022. Similar to domestic traffic, the biggest gainers were in the Asia Pacific region, again, which rose more than 100% year-over-year in international travel in that region, and there's a continuation of resumption of normalized international traffic patterns in Asia. Wide-body aircraft demand has really picked up pace as a result of economic strength in Asia as well as growing international demand globally. We continue to foresee strong growth in the Asian market ahead, particularly opportunities in the Asia to North America and Asia to Europe routes, but we also see strong continued expansion in a number of other markets as well. Major traffic flows such as North America to Europe and North America to South America, for example, continue to expand significantly. Many domestic markets worldwide also illustrate strength and further growth momentum. Passenger load factors also continue to climb coming in at 82% in the latest month as reported by IATA. And in a number of markets, it's already exceeding these levels. This is putting pressure on the airlines to find additional aircraft capacity to satisfy robust air travel demand, and we would anticipate load factors to go up even higher in the year ahead given the limited supply of commercial aircraft and OEM delivery constraints. IATA is expecting industry load factors to reach 83% in 2024, which is in line with record highs, but a number of markets are either already well above their highs or are expected to meaningfully exceed these industry average levels and these could certainly go higher. Continuation of this trend would further increase the need for more new commercial aircraft. Airline health meanwhile, continues to improve overall with the airline industry revenues expected for the first time to hit a record of $1 trillion in 2024. Strong traffic volumes and yields have also been a key to this expansion over the last few years. Profitability of the industry is expected to achieve $25 billion or so in 2024. We recently had extensive conversations with many of our airline customers while in Europe over the past few weeks. Each of them have echoed the view that operating conditions are attractive overall, and all of these airlines were asking us for more aircraft. On the credit front, we selectively avoided doing business with some of the larger airlines that went bankrupt over the last year, including Gol of Brazil, Go First in India, and Viva Air in Colombia. In addition to being selective with our customers, I would like to remind you that our fleet is very geographically diverse, with 119 customers in 62 countries at the end of 2023, with about 1% average exposure position per customer. So our conservative portfolio management strategy further reduces risk to any individual airline. We also maintained significant cash security deposits and maintenance reserves as added installation from customers that could run into challenges. You can see this in our balance sheet at around $1.5 billion at year-end. This is a meaningfully large number almost 6% of the net carrying value of our fleet. These funds are paid into Air Lease by our airline customers for our benefit and effectively reduce our net interest expense and provide us meaningful credit protection. Returning to ALC's fourth quarter results, we delivered 22 new aircraft from our order book period, consisting primarily of narrow-body aircraft along with 2 Airbus widebodies. We delivered 6, A220 aircraft in the quarter, 5 were delivered to ITA Airways in Italy. And 1 A220-300 was delivered to a growing airline in Southeastern Europe. We continue to see the A220 gaining traction globally with both new and existing customers given its attractive economics and fuel efficiency. We delivered one A320-200neo aircraft to SATA based in Azores as well as 8, A321-200neos, 2 going to ITA, joining the 5, A220 deliveries I just mentioned; 2, to LATAM Airlines, the largest airline in Latin America, and the first 2 deliveries of total A321s will be delivering to that airline. In addition, we also delivered 1 A321-200neo to each Air Astana based in Central Asia, SKY airline based in Chile and Sunclass Airlines in Denmark as well as the first Airbus A321neo to Transavia in the Netherlands. On the Boeing side, we delivered 5 new 737s during the quarter, including 2 737-8 to Malaysia airline and one 737-9 each to Aeromexico, Alaska Airlines and Corendon in Netherlands. Lastly, we delivered 2 new A330-900neo widebodies, one to ITA and one to Sunclass Airlines in Scandinavia, joining their narrow-body sister ships, which were delivered in the quarter that I just highlighted. Lastly, I would like to emphasize a point from John's section on the value of our fleet and forward order book. Simply looking at our consistent gains on aircraft sales. It is clear that there is significant value embedded in the aircraft in our fleet as compared to the depreciated cost basis held on our books. With all that said, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Greg Willis, for his more detailed comments on our financial performance in 2023."", 'Gregory B. Willis', ""Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Air Lease generated revenues $717 million, which comprised of approximately $644 million of rental revenues and $73 million from aircraft sales, trading and other activities. The increase in our total revenues was driven by the growth of our fleet $59 million in gains recognized from our sales activities and $60 million in end of lease revenue stemming from the return of 7 aircraft.Let me remind you that the earnings model in aircraft leasing includes not only the base rental payments that we recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease, but also includes the earnings that we generate from Interlease payments and maintenance reserves as well as the gains that we record from the ultimate sale of the aircraft. These additional income streams serve to enhance the overall earnings profile of the business. Sales proceeds for the fourth quarter totaled approximately $440 million from the sale of 8 aircraft. As I just mentioned, these sales generated $59 million in gains, representing a 14% premium to our carrying value, which was higher than our long-term average of 8% to 10%, further demonstrating the strength of the market and the underlying value of the aircraft that we have in our fleet. I do want to point out that our gain on sale margins will vary somewhat quarter-to-quarter based on aircraft sold and market conditions. But it's also worth highlighting that we have a robust aircraft sales pipeline aggregating $1.5 billion for future aircraft sales at accretive valuations. This pipeline not only further reinforces the underlying value of our existing fleet, but also provides a meaningful addition to our liquidity position and is a catalyst to help us reduce our financial leverage, which I will discuss later in my remarks. Moving on to expenses. Interest expense increased by $35 million and was driven by 70 basis point increase in our composite cost of funds to 3.77%, along with an increase in our debt balance. We have significantly benefited from our largely fixed rate capital structure, which has helped to moderate the effects of the current interest rate environment. You should note that we ended the year with 85% of our debt -- debt at fixed rates. Depreciation expense continues to track the growth of our fleet. With regards to SG&A, our ratio of expenses to revenue remained in line with the prior year and on an absolute basis, they increased along with the expansion of our leasing activities. It is also important to note that we disclosed in our 8-K filing in December, we recorded $67 million from a Russian insurance recovery as a benefit against our Russian write-off line item in our income statement. This recovery was helpful along with our aircraft sales activities to help us reduce our financial leverage. All of these activities, along with the quality of our fleet, helped us to generate strong financial results in the fourth quarter and for the year ended 2023, which ultimately has resulted in the continued expansion of our adjusted pretax return on equity since 2021. Our cash flow from operations for the full year 2023 rose 26% relative to 2022, benefiting from our continued strong airline customer cash collections. These healthy cash collections further our ability to reduce our debt balance and fund aircraft deliveries. Transitioning to our financing activities. We raised $3.6 billion in committed debt financings during 2023. Much of this financing was completed in the bank market, which provides us with a substantial amount of flexibility as compared to the bond market. We did return to the bond market in the fourth quarter when we raised CAD 500 million maturing in 2028 at a rate of 5.9%, inclusive of the effect of our currency swaps. Then in early January, we returned to the U.S. bond market and raised an additional USD 500 million maturing in 2029 at 5.1%, marking our lowest coupon in approximately 2 years. We are highly focused on maintaining our strong investment-grade balance sheet, utilizing unsecured debt as our primary source of financing, maintaining a high ratio of fixed rate funding and utilizing a conservative amount of leverage and targeting a debt-to-equity ratio of 2.5x. Our liquidity position remains strong at $6.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, and our unencumbered asset base of $29 billion is a source of strength on our balance sheet. Our debt-to-equity ratio at the end of the third quarter was roughly 2.68x on a GAAP basis, which net of cash on the balance sheet is approximately 2.61x. As I mentioned previously, we continue to utilize the proceeds from aircraft sales and Russian recoveries to pay down debt and to help us reach our long-term target debt to equity of 2.5x over the medium term. Echoing the key observations made by Steve and John, we feel very positive about the positioning of our business in the current environment, and we believe our fleet and order book of the newest and highest in-demand commercial aircraft remain a key strategic advantage. We continue to foresee these high-demand assets and the market supply-demand imbalances as enhancing our performance in the years ahead. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jason for the question-and-answer session of the call."", 'Jason Arnold', 'Thanks very much, Greg. This concludes our commentary and remarks. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please open the lines for the Q&A session.', 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) It looks like our first question today comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs."", ""Catherine Maureen O'Brien"", ""Thanks for the time. Totally understand that quarter-to-quarter, we should expect that gain on sale to bounce around, of course, but had a solid gain this quarter, up from last quarter. With everything that's going on with the MAX and GTF, should we expect supply to remain tight or maybe even get tighter as we move to this year? And should that translate to potentially keeping that gain on sale higher than the historical average. Just any color there on both the supply and demand side and thoughts on the gain that Air Lease could enjoy in that environment would be super helpful."", 'John L. Plueger', ""Thanks, Catie. The answer is yes. We do believe that the supply will remain constrained. As to the impact on forward sales gain, I really can't comment too much. We've got a robust pipeline of $1.5 billion. All these things are taken into consideration. But I think there's no question in our mind that the supply will remain constrained."", 'Steven F. Udvar-Hazy', ""For every airplane that we have for sale, we have multiple buyers. So it's been a very dynamic market. And it's led to a high level of liquidity in the secondhand market for aircraft and Air Lease is having a high-quality fleet will continue to enjoy significant gains when we dispose of these assets."", ""Catherine Maureen O'Brien"", ""Okay. That's great. And then I was just hoping to get some more color on the returned aircraft and the end of lease revenue. I'm not sure if you can share this, but obviously, which airline and what type of aircraft would be helpful. And then just how should we think about the turnaround of getting those aircraft back out the door as you just spoke to, I'm sure there's plenty of interest and taking those aircraft off your hands. But what's MRO capacity like? Is that still pretty tight just in terms of the time line to get reconfiguration work done to get the back out of the quarter."", 'Steven F. Udvar-Hazy', ""Your question is really 2 parts. Let me explain the first part. We have 2 types of leases. Many of our leases, the airline pays a monthly overhaul maintenance reserve for the usage of engines, airframe components, landing year and so forth. So there's a monthly cash inflow over and above the rental. And then we have some leases where that compensation comes at the end of the lease. So it's kind of a catch up. And so some of these transactions that you referred to was simply where the leases had come to an end or where we agreed by mutual agreement with the airline to recover the aircraft. And then we were able to obtain additional funds, keep all the security deposits and in effect, get the present benefit of the maintenance reserves that accrued during the life of the lease. And then the second question, MRO capacity is very tight. So we try to keep those transitions to an absolute minimum, and we try to lay off those expenses on the next airline rather than having to use ALC's resources."", 'John L. Plueger', ""Let me just add, Catie, that where we do have an expiration in my prepared remarks, I highlighted the fact that we have a very high rate of lease extension and that continues to be the case. There's not a lot many this year, but we have -- our historical average is 75% of our leases -- first run leases get extended. I don't know what the current percentage is today, but I would strongly imagine it's well north of 90% to 95%."", 'Steven F. Udvar-Hazy', 'And just by way of example, one of the aircraft that was in this category was an A321 and the new lease that we signed with another airline as a follow-on, is paying us a higher rental rate than the original lease and the other aircraft being a 737-800, we had the same phenomenon with a new lease, had higher lease rates than at least that just expired.', ""Catherine Maureen O'Brien"", ""That's great. Yes, I guess I was assuming those maybe were early returns, but wasn't factoring and maybe some of that was just coming to their natural end. That's all super helpful."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.', 'Jamie Nathaniel Baker', ""First one, probably for Greg on Russia. If you look at what you initially wrote off, not what the insurance claim was, but what you wrote off, where are we in terms of aggregate recovery inclusive of the $67 million disclosed in the fourth quarter? I mean if you were to express recovery as a percentage of book, we're hearing around $0.65, $0.70 on the dollar elsewhere. Just wondering if the Air Lease metric is consistent with that."", 'Gregory B. Willis', ""I think to date, we recovered about 10% to 12% of our $800 million charge that we took last year. I can't really comment about what the market is for claims in the marketplace. And ultimately, we're kind of limited about how much we can actually talk about our recovery efforts on the call."", 'Jamie Nathaniel Baker', ""Okay. Well, that's helpful. And then second, if I back out sale proceeds in the end of life revenue, it looks like lease yields are uninspiring. So at or near the lowest level since 2021, which seems, I don't know, a little inconsistent with how bold up everybody is on aircraft leasing. So what Mark and I were wondering, are lease extensions to blame for this. Is that what's potentially leading upside on the table relative to how strong market rates reportedly are?"", 'Gregory B. Willis', ""No, I think it's really being driven by, as you sell off older airplanes. They typically are at the highest point of their yield in our life cycle. And as you layer on younger airplanes, they start off at their lowest and then as they age, the yield goes up. I think that is putting probably the main driver where it is because you're right, as John mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are seeing lease rates really start to get going."", 'John L. Plueger', ""And let me just add, as I stated in my prepared remarks, our lease placements are roughly 2 years ahead of the actual deliveries. So when you see this strengthening over the last year, you can just assume that what we're delivering, for example, this year were largely leases that we struck in '21 and early '22."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Hillary Cacanando with Deutsche Bank. Hillary, please go ahead.', 'Hillary Cacanando', ""In the past, you used to break out China separately in your press release. It looks like this time around you combined it with Asia. Could you discover what the exposure to China was in the fourth quarter? And if you're continuing to reduce the exposure to the country?"", 'Gregory B. Willis', ""Yes. We consolidated the reason because our exposure to China has gone down significantly below 10%. I think it was below 7% actually, and that's disclosed in the details of the 10-K. And I know that, that just hit the wire at 1:00 Pacific Time. So it doesn't surprise you that you weren't able to find a detail there, but that's the main reason."", 'Hillary Cacanando', 'Okay, got it. And then previously, you said that the extension rate was about 90% given the tight market, has that increased at all in the recent quarter? And are you seeing any differences between the extension rates for narrow-body versus the wide-bodies? And then just in terms of economics, are you better off if the airlines extend and you have to incur the marketing costs? Or are you better off if you remarket those aircraft and maybe potentially get higher rates just given the tight market.', 'John L. Plueger', ""Yes, extension. The rates of lease extension have not softened. They continue to remain very strong, well north of 90%. I don't have the specific calculation in front of me, I believe that's pretty accurate. Lease rates in the extensions are going up for single aisle and tonal aircraft. And on that level, I wish we had more of them coming up this year. But we're seeing a nice appreciation in lease rates. Steve gave some specific examples in an answer to a previous question that we've experienced, where in a few cases, we've had leases extend, either extend at higher rates or to a new lessee at higher rates than the original leases."", 'Hillary Cacanando', ""Okay. And then just, I guess, in terms of economics, are you better off if they extend because you don't have to be in course of remarketing costs? Or could you get better rates if you remarket them?"", 'John L. Plueger', ""That's a good question, and it's very much a case-by-case basis. We do look at that question on every single extension versus transferring to another carrier. So that is very much a part of the calculus."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from the line of Terry Ma with Barclays.', 'Terry Ma', 'I think in the 10-K, you called out 22 returned aircraft this year. Any color you can give on how many of those have actually transitioned versus how many aircraft that are waiting the transition?', 'Gregory B. Willis', ""Terry, what I would point you to is our utilization percentage, and that's at 99.9% and about -- I mean, almost all of our airplanes are subject to lease at the current moment. I think a lot of these were regular returns. So we had a customer lined up to take the airplane at the return check. So it's a pretty seamless operation."", 'Terry Ma', 'Got it. So even the 7 aircraft that were returned this quarter, they should be earning rental revenue in Q1.', 'Gregory B. Willis', 'Yes.', 'Terry Ma', ""Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then you mentioned lease rates on new deliveries are higher. Is there any color you can give even ballpark, how much higher the lease rates on 2024 deliveries and '25 deliveries are relative to what's on book today?"", 'Gregory B. Willis', ""What you can do is you can look at -- there's a lot of appraisal data out there that has shown what's going on with lease rates. And I'm a little hesitant directing you to the appraisal data because they typically lag the market by 6 to 12 months, but they've been very vocal in their views on what's happening with lease rates, and you can see some very significant 10% to 15% increases in lease rates over the last period of time."", 'Steven F. Udvar-Hazy', ""Well, also, please be reminded that many of our leases that we wrote in '21, '22, had interest rate adjusters. So when the aircraft delivers, we look at the 5-year treasury or 7-year treasury or some benchmark and then the lease is adjusted not only for the escalation from the manufacturer also for the prevalent interest rates at the time of delivery. So based on the current interest rate situation, you can mathematically derive that aircraft delivering today are at a higher lease rate than they were 12, 18 months ago."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.', 'Ronald Jay Epstein', ""Just a couple of quick ones, if I can. And you mentioned this a little bit in the prepared remarks before, but how long do you think it's going to take until the MAX gets back to some sort of regular rate of cadence, meaning and I guess this was asked in a sense before, I mean, how long do you think the supply and demand imbalance is going to be in the narrow-body market, right? I mean, it could be years, years, right? Are we thinking about this wrong?"", 'John L. Plueger', ""No, you're right. I mean, the supply/demand invent, we do believe will go on for years. And Boeing is delivering MAXs today. The only question is how many production rate increases and at what pace they'll be able to increase that rate. As it's been publicized, the FAA has put a limit on that rate until it is more satisfied. It's -- so we really can't judge, Ron, when that -- that's anybody's guess as to when that restriction on production rate might be lifted. But Boeing is delivering MAXs. We're taking delivery of MAXs that the single-aisle shortage is going to be going on for quite some time."", 'Steven F. Udvar-Hazy', ""Ron, one other point, the lease rates we're seeing for new MAX 8s and new A320neos are almost neck and neck. We're really not seeing a worst lease rate environment for new Max versus an A320. Now obviously, the A321 is a different animal. And then the 737 MAX is between the Dash 8 and the A321 rates. But the Dash 8 rates for new 737s and A320neos they're almost at the same level."", 'Ronald Jay Epstein', 'Got it. Got it. That was actually my next question. So thank you for that.', 'Steven F. Udvar-Hazy', 'I know, I read your mind.', 'Ronald Jay Epstein', ""Yes, you did. It's quite successful. That was a good one. So the next question, the follow-on from that would be, if this is going to last for a long time, does this open the aperture for more A220s out there or more E2-195s, be it that there's some lift available there in the more near term?"", 'John L. Plueger', ""Yes. I think it does. We've been successful in our 220 placements and at the same time, we're watching how the engine improvements are leading into the gear turbo fan, the 1500 that powers those airplanes. So I think, yes, there is some acceleration on both those aircraft types."", 'Steven F. Udvar-Hazy', ""Yes. Ron, just to give you an example, if I look back in the last, say, 1.5 years on our A220 placements, for example, in Europe, they are replacing A319s, A320s, 737-700s. So they're replacing aircraft in that 130 to 180 seat size. In some cases, they're replacing larger aircraft. Like in ITA, for example, they're replacing some of their older A320 CEOs with A220s. We have a deal in the Czech Republic, while all their A320s are being replaced by A220s. In Bulgaria, we have 7 A220s replacing a combination of A319s and A320s. So airplane is really catching on. And with the recent orders from Lufthansa, you've got really now a very strong customer base here with Delta, JetBlue, Air Canada, in North America. The airplane is catching on. But it is production constrained."", 'Ronald Jay Epstein', 'Would you be supportive of a 220 and 500, the kind of mythical stretch of the airplane?', 'Steven F. Udvar-Hazy', 'What kind of engines are you going to put on it.', 'Ronald Jay Epstein', 'You tell me.', 'John L. Plueger', ""I think, Ron, at this point in time, we're not overly optimistic or favoring an A220-500. We think the -- we think that the production of the A220-100 and 300 and the continued maturation of the engine on that airplane is sufficient for most markets these days. There's one or 2 airlines that would like it. But frankly, I think with all the strain and production rate pressure that Airbus is under, it's still got to deliver and certify the A350 freighter and the XLR, these are 2 big certification programs. Let's not put another pressure on the development or the supply chain that could take away time and attention or quality from Airbus."", 'Steven F. Udvar-Hazy', ""And Ron, also, if you look at the infrastructure in Mobile and in Montreal, I just don't see that Airbus could build 30, 40, 50 of these a month. It just doesn't appear to be achievable with what's in place currently."", 'Operator', ""Our next question comes from the line of Catie O'Brien again with Goldman Sachs."", ""Catherine Maureen O'Brien"", ""Just (inaudible) puts and takes of the other questions and had one on that spread. You timed the market really nicely in January with that unsecured deal, but you do have some sub-1% maturities, I think, rolling off this year. So guessing we'll continue to see the average cost of that move higher? And then on the rental side of the equation, as you noted, most of the aircraft are taking delivery of this year would have leases written in 2021, 2022 when we weren't quite yet in this really strong period, we're speaking to on lease rates. So I guess what I'm getting at would it follow that we should expect to see net spread perhaps compress a little bit before the tailwinds of the current lease rate environment drive expansion in '25, '26. Just any high-level thoughts there would be super helpful."", 'Gregory B. Willis', ""I think it's really hard to say right now, especially given what's going on with the Fed and where interest rates are going to go. I think it's really hard to predict. We do have pretty good visibility of what's coming on the lease rate side, but we've really shied away from giving guidance on what direction our lease spread is going to go."", 'Steven F. Udvar-Hazy', ""And we do have, what, about a $19 billion book of fixed rate liabilities already and those are not going to change too much. So even if we issue another $500 million or $700 million bond in the 4s or low 5s, it's not going to change the overall dynamics of our balance sheet."", 'John L. Plueger', ""Catie your estimation of how many Fed rate cuts there will be before the end of the year is probably much better than ours. All I can say is going into the end of '23, it's clear that the market had priced in probably too many too aggressive of Fed rate cuts, but we do expect them this year. So again, your guess is as good as ours."", ""Catherine Maureen O'Brien"", ""Yes. I'll leave that to the people smarter than me in the macro department here. But Okay."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Trent with Citi.', 'Stephen Trent', ""Most of mine have been answered, but I was really curious about your aircraft procurement. I mean, not just for you guys but for the industry broadly, would you say, for instance, that lessors could start leaning more on obtaining planes through a little more through sale leaseback activity versus what's previously been the case. Or is that not so relevant for you guys because you already have such strong order books from the OEMs? Just was wondering what you see as the opportunity for the space as you procure aircraft."", 'John L. Plueger', ""Yes. We've -- our business model has always been and will remain primarily as an order book-driven lessor. We have a very large order book that will go out through '29. So we are not large players and never have been in the sale-leaseback marketplace. I don't see, in terms of the broad distribution, it's those who don't have order books, by definition, we'll have to do sale-leasebacks, but it's never been a huge part of our business, except for we do participate indirectly in some of the managed vehicles that we run for other investors. In some cases, the sale-leaseback marketplace presents certain opportunities for them. Classically, the returns and the lease rates and the sale-leaseback part of the business has been lower than on the order book part of the business. So we guided a little bit towards our managed vehicles, but we will always remain primarily a new aircraft order book lessor."", 'Steven F. Udvar-Hazy', ""And we believe that, that business strategy results in a lower acquisition cost of aircraft then when you step into an airline's order with a markup to do a sale leaseback. So we believe we have significant capital cost advantage in the acquisition of these portfolios directly from the OEMs rather than through a third party."", 'Operator', 'And our final question today comes from Doug Runte with Deutsche Bank.', 'Douglas William Runte', ""Thanks very much for taking the question from the fixed income side of the balance sheet. A question on the order book. There's an interesting split in the market among large thoughtful lessors as to whether you should line up at the tent at the air show to place orders or whether it's okay to place orders extending over the horizon past 2030. I'm wondering where you come down on that given that your order book commitment ends towards 2028, 2029."", 'Steven F. Udvar-Hazy', ""Yes. We don't believe that joining this order frenzy is really a good strategy for us. If you truly believe that every one of those orders that have been placed in the last 2 years are going to get delivered on time and to the very airlines and institutions that have ordered it, then our strategy is probably flawed. But we don't believe that those hundreds of aircraft will wind up exactly where they were intended. There will always be pockets of opportunity. There will be airlines that will not be able to honor their obligations. So we think we can supplement our backlog as and when needed to cover that period 2028 and '29. We're in really good shape over the next 4.5 years. So we're less worried about new aircraft in 2030."", 'Douglas William Runte', 'Great. Thank you very much for that color and a quick follow-up, a little more granular. You have quite a few 777-300 ERs coming off lease in the next 2 to 3 years. Have you engaged in placement talks with that? Does it look like they will be extended or is there potentially going to be a need to reposition those to new operators?', 'John L. Plueger', ""Yes, Those are going to be extended for the very most part, Doug. There's -- we're well underway on -- with several large carriers in that process."", 'Steven F. Udvar-Hazy', 'We have pulled every one of our 777-300 ER SCs, Doug, and not a single one has expressed any interest in returning them.', 'Douglas William Runte', ""Wow, that's terrific news."", 'Steven F. Udvar-Hazy', ""Whether we extend them for 3 years or 5 years or 8 years and at what rate. That's the variable. It's not an if question, it's at what rate are we extending and for what term?"", 'Operator', 'All right. Thank you, Doug. And that concludes our question-and-answer session today. And with that, Mr. Arnold, I will turn the call back over to you.', 'Jason Arnold', 'Thanks, everyone, for your time participating in our fourth quarter call. We look forward to speaking to you again in May. Greg, please disconnect the line. Thanks for your assistance.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.""]"

Internal controls during 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Oswald for a review of the operating results. Steve?"", 'Steve Oswald', ""Okay. Thank you, Samantha, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our fourth quarter conference call today. And as usual, I'll give an update on the current situation of the company, after which Sumant will review our financial results in detail. Q4 was a very good quarter as we wrapped up 2023. Revenues exceeded $190 million for the second consecutive quarter to $192.2 million, driving a full year revenue of $757 million with the last high mark set in 2020 12. Strong growth in our single-aisle commercial aircraft business helped to drive the revenue. The continued recovery in commercial aerospace once again delivered in Q4 with Boeing single aisle platform business in aggregate being up 46% year over year, along with Airbus 80 20 program showing strong growth of 73% year over year. Overall, commercial aerospace with Airbus and Boeing and others was up 18% from Q4 2022, spite Boeing's in spirits, continued challenges with Max quality issues. We are now in our 10th quarter of year-over-year revenue growth for commercial aerospace, a continued excellent sign for DCO and the industry. While our defense business is slightly down quarter with sunsetting programs such as the F-18 having an impact, the company also experienced strong demand in the Apache program as well as increases for F-35 and the Mir missile platform. The defense business was over $100 million revenue once again at $103 million of revenue for the quarter. We remain optimistic about the growth ahead as we go through a tiny transition on certain programs. The ever-growing backlog in defense tells the story with backlog, up $70 million from last year and $33 million from Q3 2023. Defense backlog now stands at over $0.5 billion at $527.1 million. And other real bright spot in Q4 was gross margins of 21.7% for the fourth for Q4, up four up 120 basis points year over year from 20.5% as we began realizing benefits from our strategic pricing initiatives, productivity improvements and some initial restructuring savings. We are now also in the final stages of operation at our variable Arkansas and Monrovia, California performance centers are targeting a full shutdown by June 30th, final approval stage with RTX for the Tomahawk harnesses going to Mexico. The last product still being produced at various of that variable is close and we continue to have a full effort with BABCS. and B., a defense on the MAX boilers and Apache tail rotors, respectively, working with them on approval and building buffer due to the low level of production at both sites. We do have some headwinds, but this is temporary and will clear after the closures for adjusted operating margin in Q4, the team delivered 8.3% compared to 8.1% in Q4 2022 a nice result while investing some of the gross margin improvement after a few lean years during COVID and the ramp up of commercial aerospace, GAAP diluted EPS was $0.34 a share in Q4 2023 versus $0.65 a share for Q4 2022. And with the adjustments, diluted EPS was a solid $0.7 a share compared to diluted EPS of $0.85 in the prior year. Some key drivers for the lower GAAP diluted EPS include higher interest expense due to higher interest rates, higher inventory purchase accounting adjustments and higher SG&A expenses as we invested in the business to position it for future. The total Company backlog performance increased decreased both sequentially and compared to the prior year. Total Company backlog ended 2023 at almost $994 million, increasing over $30 million, both sequentially and compared to the prior year. Defense backlog, as mentioned earlier, also increased $70 million compared to the prior year to the end at direct at a record of $527 million. The strong defense backlog reaffirms the common defense business remains in good shape with more positive news to come. The commercial aerospace backlog, however, decreased slightly year over year, primarily due to industry issues with single-aisle production rates, specifically the MAX issues mentioned earlier with BA and spirit, but still ended Q4 2023 at a solid $429 million for offloading from the French fries. The work continues. We are expecting roughly $90 million for the full year 2024 as committed to mainly in our circuit card business for RTX in new areas such as radar for the SPY. six. As communicated, the long-term run rate of these defense programs already commercialized or in development for offloading will be over $125 million by 2025. Once the transition work is completed in Q4, our team delivered another good quarter, managing the supply chain as evidenced by positive revenue growth along with significant gross margin expansion compared to a year ago. Another great example of productivity improvements and people is the revenue for our employee number, which granted as a high-level number, but then increase significantly by 16% in 2023 versus 2022. Does a terrific job everyone at the Company. 2023 record revenues of $757 million was a solid 6.2% growth over 2022 and in line with the guidance of 6% to 6.5%. We provided to you during the Q3 call. We were obviously happy with this record number last set in 2012, especially in light of the seven 37 MAX headwinds with BA and spirit that created a more modest pace than had been expected and single aisle production rate and 2023 for revenue guidance for 2024, we believe that with the uncertainty surrounding BA Spirit and the FAA at this point on the MAX, the best approaches to guide to mid single digits and look to further updates on future earnings calls the commercial aerospace recovery will continue to expand along with growth in defense, which is backed by our record backlog. We continue to be active with acquisitions as in 20, our acquisition last April. I believe this is another catalyst to drive us possibly higher in year ahead. Now let me provide some additional color on our markets, products and programs. Beginning with our military and space sector. We experienced our second consecutive quarter of revenues of $100 million at $102.8 million compared to $108.4 million in Q4 of 2022, while lower, we saw some bright spots, including strong demand for the Apache tail rotor blades with over 380% year over year growth and increased demand for other military and space products, other military, rotary wing platforms, F-35 and Amir missile as well. The fourth quarter military and space revenue represented 50% -- 53% of Ducommun's revenue in the period, down from 58% last year. And this trend will continue to reflect more balance with commercial aerospace, which we like We also ended the fourth quarter with backlog in excess of $500 million to $527 million, an increase of $70 million year over year and represents 53% of the common total. Yes. Within our commercial aerospace operations, fourth quarter revenue saw double-digit growth once again, increasing 18% year over year to $80 million driven mainly by build rate increases on large aircraft platforms, including the seven 37 MAX and a three to 20 platforms and twin aisle commercial aircraft platforms, commercial rotary wing aircraft platforms and regional and business jets. As many of you are aware, the FAA announced in January that will increase its oversight of Boeing as well as we probably get approval for production rate increases or additional production lines for the seven 37 MAX until it is satisfied. That Ball is in full compliance with required quality control procedures. This will likely cap the production of the seven 37 MAX, but we need to see how things go in Q1 of 2024 and the FAA going forward plan. We do, however, expect the long-term trend to remain positive once the issues are fully addressed. The backlog within our commercial aerospace sector was $429 million at the end of the fourth quarter and while it was $21 million lower year over year and increased $7 million sequentially, a solid number given the temporary weakness in commercial aerospace. With that, I'll have Suman, review our financial results in detail. Suman?"", 'Suman Mookerji', ""Thank you, Steve. As a reminder, please see the Company's Q4 earnings release for a further description of information mentioned on today's call. As Steve discussed, our fourth quarter results reflect another period of good performance. We again saw a significant increase in our commercial aerospace revenues. We remain encouraged by the continued strength in domestic and global travel, which should support higher long-term demand for aircraft as we work through some of the industry issues impacting single-aisle production rates. In addition, we are encouraged by the strong backlog growth in our military and space business that should help drive our revenues in that end user segment going forward. During the quarter, we also continued to make progress on our restructuring program, and I will provide some more color shortly with all this, we feel like we have entered 2024 with good momentum as will continue to drive our performance. Now turning to our fourth quarter results. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $192.2 million versus $188.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The year-over-year increase reflects $12.1 million of growth across our commercial aerospace platforms, partially offset by $5.6 million of lower revenue within the military and space sector due to lower build rates on various missile platforms and military fixed-wing aircraft platforms such as the F-18, partially offset by higher build rates on military rotary wing aircraft platforms such as the Apache new common total backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $993.6 million This includes a record backlog in our defense and end-users defense end-user segment, which grew by $33 million to a total $527 million backlog in our commercial aerospace business increased slightly during the quarter from 440 -- $423 million at the end of Q3 to $429 million at the end of Q4. As a reminder, we define backlog as potential revenue based on customer purchase orders and long-term agreements with firm fixed prices and expected delivery dates of 24 months or less. We posted total gross profit of $41.7 million or 21.7% of revenue for the quarter versus $38.6 million or 20.5% of revenue in the prior year period. We continue to share adjusted gross margins as we have certain non-GAAP cost of sales items in the current and prior year period relating to inventory step-up amortization on our recent acquisitions, restructuring charges and the impact of the Guaymas fire on our operations. On an adjusted basis, our gross margins were 23.2% in Q4 2023 versus 21% in Q4 2022. The improvement in gross margins was driven by favorable product mix, better pricing and improved scale in our commercial aerospace business. We continue to work through a difficult operating environment with supply chain and labor. However, through our proactive efforts, including strategic buys and our inventory investments, we have been able to avoid any significant impacts thus far on our business. In parallel, we continue to look for opportunities to run wind, our working capital investments to improve our cash flow. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we were able to reduce our inventory by $16 million sequentially compared to Q3. We also reduced our contract assets, net of contract liabilities by $15 million. Ducommun reported operating income for the fourth quarter of $8.9 million or 4.6% of revenue compared to $9.7 million or 5.1% of revenue in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income was $15.9 million or 8.3% of revenue this quarter compared to $15.2 million or 8.1% of revenue in the comparable period last year. The Company reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 of $5.1 million, our $0.34 per diluted share compared to net income of 81 -- $8.1 million, or $0.65 per diluted share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the Company reported net income of $10.4 million, or $0.7 per diluted share compared to net income of $10.6 million or $0.85 in Q4 2022. The lower adjusted net income during the quarter, despite a higher level of adjusted operating income, was driven mainly by higher interest costs, partially offset by lower income tax expense. This was primarily due to the impact of Fed rate hike on short-term interest rates. I will discuss this along with our interest rate hedge, which took effect on January first, 2024 shortly. Now let me turn to our segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $85.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus $68.2 million last year. The year-over-year increase reflects $12.3 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications mainly for single-aisle aircraft for the seven three seven MAX and A. two 20 platforms and $5 million of higher revenue within the military and space markets, mainly from the ramp-up in sales in the Apache program and other military rotary wing aircraft platforms. Structural Systems operating income for the quarter was $6.6 million or 7.7% of revenue compared to $4.4 million or 6.4% of revenue last year. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 14.6% in Q4 2023 versus 10.8% in Q4 2022. Strong year-over-year improvement was driven by favorable product mix, better pricing and higher and more scale in the businesses have in the business as our commercial aerospace revenues have continued to grow. This has been another great quarter for our Structural Systems segment. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $106.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus $120 million in the prior year period. The decline was mainly due to lower revenues with the company's military and space customers, including the impact and timing of reductions in revenues on sunsetting programs such as the F-18, not synchronized with growth in sales from the company's position on next-gen platform. Electronic Systems. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $9.8 million or 9.2% of revenue versus $13 million or 10.8% of revenue in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges and other adjustments in both years, the segment operating margin was 10.2% in Q4 2023 versus 12.9% in Q4 2022. Year over year decrease was due to unfavorable product mix. And as Steve mentioned earlier, due to the loss of manufacturing volume and inefficiencies at our very well performance center as we wind down their operations. To clarify, such inefficiencies have not been considered as restructuring charges in our calculation of adjusted operating income or adjusted EBITDA. Next on the restructuring. As a reminder, and as discussed previously, we commenced a restructuring initiative back in 2022. These actions are being taken to accelerate the achievement of our strategic goals and to better position the Company for stronger performance in the short and long term. This includes the shutdown of our facilities in Monrovia, California and variable Arkansas and transfer of majority of that work to a low-cost operation in Guaymas, Mexico, with the remainder going to other existing performance centers in the United States we continue to make progress in these transitions with excellent employee retention and engagement and are also working diligently with our customers, Boeing and RPX to obtain the requisite approvals during Q4 2023, we recorded $1.9 million in restructuring charges. The majority of these charges were severance and benefits related as we continue to wind down the two operations. The recertification process is ongoing, and we plan to close both facilities fully in the first half of 2024, we expect to incur $5 million to $7 million in restructuring expenses through 2024, and that will conclude the spending upon completion of our restructuring program. We expect to generate $11 million to $13 million in annual savings from our actions and expect a portion of those savings to be realized starting in the second half of 2024, we anticipate selling the land and buildings at both Monrovia, California and variable Arkansas. Turning next to liquidity and capital resources. During Q4 2023, we generated $26.5 million in cash flow from operating activities, which was up from $14.3 million in Q3 2023. For the full year 2023, we generated $31.1 million in cash flow from operating activities. This is despite cash payments of $10.7 million for restructuring and $18.3 million for taxes relating to changes in rules for R&D tax credits relating to 2022 and 2023 at the end of the fourth quarter, we have available liquidity of $218.9 million, comprising of the unutilized portion of our revolver and cash on hand, our existing credit facility was put in place in July 2022 at an opportune time in the credit markets, allowing us to reduce our spread, increased the size of our revolver and allowing us the flexibility to execute on our acquisition strategy. Our debt through Q4 2023 was 100% floating and linked to software as a result. And as I have highlighted before the increase in our interest cost from $3.5 million in Q4 2022 to $5.4 million in Q4 2023 was driven by the run-up in short-term rates due to the Fed rate hike. In November 2021, we had put in place an interest rate hedge that went into effect for a seven year period starting January 2024 and begs the one month term so far at 170 basis points for $150 million of our debt. This will help drive significant interest cost savings in 2024 and beyond. To conclude the financial overview for Q4 2023. I would like to say that we had a strong finish to 2023 and anticipate another strong year in 2024. I would now like to turn it back over to Steve for his closing remarks."", 'Steve Oswald', ""Steve, we had actually one. So just a couple of more comments were good questions and closing. I think Q4 was a very good quarter with many highlights for the Company and our shareholders in addition to achieving all-time highs for annual revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $757 million, $102 million, respectively, in 2023 are wonderful milestones and very happy for the hardworking to Kaman team and all of our other stakeholders for those achievements. I also want to mention that 2024 will be our 175th year of continuous operation here to come a great achievement, and we will be recognizing that through the year. Final note, as our 2027 strategy, which we've talked about. We had a strong 1st year with both engineered products and aftermarket, gaining a larger percentage of revenue for the company in 2023 versus 2022 and the future. It's very bright. If those remarks, I will conclude and open up to questions. Thank you for listening."", 'Operator', 'Certainly as a reminder, to ask a question please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one again, please standby while we compile the Q&A roster. And one moment for our first question. Our first question will be coming from Griffin balls of B. Riley Securities. Your line is Yes.', 'Griffin Boss', 'Hi, thank you for taking my questions. So Steve, you just mentioned the Engineered Products and aftermarket parts. Are there any more specific details you can give on percentage of revenue there and how you would characterize that trending going forward versus the rest of the business.', 'Steve Oswald', ""And so I'm not going to disclose an actual number, though, just not just at this time, we will probably do something as we go forward at Investor Day meeting, but it was certainly it was certainly up quite a bit. I will say that both in revenue, both in revenue and the aftermarket for Engineered Products. And we're moving we have a 25% target for 2027 for revenues for Engineered Products. And we just say that we're tracking very strongly towards that and to beat it."", 'Griffin Boss', ""Okay, great. Fair enough. And I appreciate the color. And then on So we saw a sequential on slight sequential decline in gross margin. I'm just curious if you can add a little bit more color on what you're seeing there and how you're thinking about that in on the next quarter and going into '24."", 'Steve Oswald', 'Repeat that question once more Griffin?', 'Griffin Boss', ""Yes. So I mean, we saw a sequential decline in gross margin on. I was just curious if you could give some more color on what was driving that and how you're thinking about that trending going into '24?"", 'Suman Mookerji', ""That's why. So the sequential decline was driven by one product mix, but also because we have two facilities that we are in the process of winding down, and we're just producing inefficiently there, given the much lower volume of operations versus the size and scope of those facilities and that's causing a drag and particularly on the Electronic Systems side, but also some drive on the structural system side. And we expect that as headwinds to linger, but gradually go down as we close those both those facilities in the first half of 2024?"", 'Steve Oswald', ""Yes, I think you cannot just put some color on that for bearings of, for instance, shall adjourn quarter, obviously have a lot less people are reserved for it. We would run sort of $7 million a quarter at Perryville and now are less than $1 million just making the Tomahawk. So that's why there's a little bit of a timing issue or have some of that."", 'Griffin Boss', ""Okay, great. Thanks for. Thanks for the detail on that. And then just one last one for me. I apologize if I missed this in the prepared remarks. Can you give us an update on how the offloading opportunities are trending and how you're thinking about the potential upside to those 2025 targets on that front?"", 'Steve Oswald', ""Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes, this is you know, I've been talking about this. We think there is some potential above the one 25, though we still have a little more work to do here. I know it's all very positive. It's actually movement isn't as I mentioned in my remarks, more to the radar business for this is, you know, a lot of it is cards, but so what happens is just you know it when you deal with RTX and you're moving work out of their facility. They have lots of inventory. They have lots of different things. We have to overcome the test equipment that they either want to keep or they don't want to keep, you know, they have that test equipment has lead times. It's over $1 million for some of these the test, the equipment, the machines so there's a lot that goes into it. But once you once it gets, the Tulsa gets somewhere else and Appleton are up, we're off to the races here. So we are actively heads down working very hard in 2024 to get a lot of this past. It was sort of the finish line here. So we'll have an update later in the year, but we're feeling real good about where we are and hope to have that report on the one 25 plus towards the end of 2024."", 'Griffin Boss', 'Ok, great. Glad to hear. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it.', 'Operator', 'Again. Ladies and gentlemen, if you do have a question, please press star one on your touchtone telephone. Again, please press star one. Our next question will be coming from Michael, your Molly of Truist Securities. Your line is open.', 'Michael Ciarmoli', ""Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And I don't know, Steve, or Sumant, just I guess if we'd look maybe to piggyback on the offloading, but if we look at defense revenue's down sequentially, you finished the year, I guess, down two years in a row. And I guess you haven't really parsed out the guidance, but it sounded like there was more conservatism in there around the MAX. What's the biggest headwind I mean I know you called out the F-16 wind down, but is there anything else, you know, impacting the defense revenue growth?"", 'Steve Oswald', ""Yes, you know, it's again, this is Mike. Good to be with you? It's you know, it's a little bit a little bit of a mix. May look, the F-18 is significant, right, not in of the total business, but the FHA will also earlier and I'll say 2021, 2022, we did these toll missile cases for Raytheon, and they were running 15 or 20 plus. So call it a year. And what happens with the toll missile cases, you know, they have problems in supply chain and they can't get the motor for the missile. And then also in the case of business dries up for year two, and we're a little bit in that valley right now. So there's just a couple there's nothing systemic to the business. We like where we are, you know, we're getting pinched here and there a little bit. But we think that coming out of this thing where we're in really good shape and we have a team. I think we had a great run with it, but now those things sometimes they come to an end."", 'Michael Ciarmoli', ""Okay. Okay. And it did I hear it right. The offloading was $90 million expected to be in '24 because I think you called out maybe seen that step up to [125 and 25]."", 'Steve Oswald', ""Yes, I think that's where we're heading. So again, work and we're you know, again, it's one of the big rocks here is the SPY. six, and there's a number of cards, right? So we have the first cards already being made at Tulsa and that's, you know, let's just those cards, the lower $15 million, $20 million a year, right? So we have those going in parallel, we've got two other layers of cards that are just general. They're in a they're in Andover. It's tough to get it over here, work and fit right initially until we get all the material from them because they get the inventory, right? So our revenue is tamped down a lot, but really a breakthrough feeling very good about 2020 for these changes to just you know, that's great businesses, but unfortunately come out of a big OEM. It's a bit of a long time coming."", 'Michael Ciarmoli', 'Got it. Got it.', 'Suman Mookerji', ""And just to highlight again, the Our defense backlog is the highest it has ever been in the last few years. So yes, you had some decline in the current year, but the backlog is at the highs, and that's kind of a two year look on We in our backlog numbers. So that's a good position here."", 'Michael Ciarmoli', ""Yes. Yes. No, no, I noticed that. Yes, definitely positive there. And it's just I guess, what's the level of conservatism or prudence that you've sort of built in for the MAX in 24? Can you even give us a sense what you're delivering to the Spirit, what you're assuming. I know we've heard, you know, kind of some several commentary from Boeing about lower first half picking up second half, but where exactly are you guys and what are you in?"", 'Steve Oswald', ""Yes, that's a little bit a little bit of a moving target. So you're over here. We are seeing better things ramping up a little bit at Spirit and Boeing and now things are, as you know, from reports on January, we feel that too right, but we're probably sitting in for some of you were probably in the 32, 34 range, right? For 2024, I'd say, right?"", 'Suman Mookerji', 'Yes, 34, yes.', 'Steve Oswald', ""Yes. So far, we like kind of made a hire but again, we have to yes, I think this momentum is just going to push us forward. And hopefully as we get through this FDA audit and rightly so, right, but you know where we're being a little modest right now, but we certainly expect things to ramp up. The good. The good news is, Mike. We have the capacity and we have the people. We just need yours."", 'Michael Ciarmoli', ""Yes, yes, makes sense. Yes. Okay, perfect. I'll jump back in the queue."", 'Suman Mookerji', 'Thank you, Mike.', 'Steve Oswald', 'Thank you, Mike.', 'Operator', ""And I'm showing no further questions I would now like to turn the conference back to Steve Oswald for closing remarks."", 'Steve Oswald', ""Okay. Let me finish up here, so I just wanted to thank everybody for joining us today. So obviously, we had a very, very good year in 2023. I'm thrilled that we're able to break through our record last established in 2012, and we're marching forwards are for 2017 commitments and we're building more engineered products or were driving more aftermarket. And you were cleaning up our contract manufacturing and taking costs out of that and driving hopefully much better day once we get these two factories closed. And I believe that's going to be the case. So looking forward to a great year ahead, we again, thank everybody for their support. And I want to again thank our employees for all their hard work in 2023. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Atlanta-based UPS said in its 2022 annual report last February that it had committed to buy two used jumbo freighters but did not identify their source.', 'UPS expects to bring the used 747-8s into service sometime between the end of the year and early 2025, spokeswoman Michelle Polk said by email.

The tracking site shows the freighter departed Hong Kong for Doha, Qatar, on Thursday.', 'Newman linked the deal to UPS’ fleet modernization and effort to retire aging MD-11 freighters in favor of more efficient, cleaner-burning aircraft.

At this time, I'll turn it over to Chris."", 'Christopher C. Womack', ""Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. 2023 was an exceptional year for Southern Company, a year in which we proved once again that we can do extraordinary things, including delivering strong financial results in the face of unprecedented headwinds and the successful completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3, the first newly constructed nuclear unit in the United States in over 3 decades. Since its July 30th in-service date, Unit 3's performance has exceeded our expectations, delivering over 5 million megawatt hours of safe, reliable, carbon-free energy across Georgia. Other noteworthy items for 2023 included constructive resolution of the Vogtle 3 and 4 prudence process, resolving all issues of reasonableness, prudence and cost recovery; successfully completed construction and commissioning for a brand-new 720-megawatt combined cycle plant on schedule and on time at Alabama Power's Plant Barry; acquired 2 new solar projects at Southern Power, which once construction is complete, will add an additional 350 megawatts of carbon-free generation to its portfolio of fully contracted renewable generation; continued progress toward our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, including our interim goal of a 50% reduction versus 2007 levels by 2030; achieving a 49% reduction in 2023; earned a National Accounts Award for Outstanding Customer Engagement by the Edison Electric Institute and top honors from J.D. Power for residential and business customer satisfaction. And just last week, Southern Company was ranked as the #1 most admired electric and gas utility in Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies list for 2024. These achievements reflect our team's steadfast commitment to keep the customers and the communities we are privileged to serve at the center of everything we do. Throughout 2023, our electric and gas franchises continue to excel at the fundamentals and started this year strong as evidenced through our preparations and execution during January's Winter Storm Heather, when electricity demands reached all-time winter peaks and Southern Company Gas' system continued reliably serving customers throughout severe weather conditions across its 4-state territory. Our ability to navigate through such severe weather events further demonstrates how our customers benefit from the combination of outstanding operational performance by each of our utilities and the value of our vertically integrated state-regulated business model. Our state's long-term integrated planning processes, which include adoption of important planning assumptions like a 26% winter reserve margin for our electric utilities, benefit our customers by providing a reliable and resilient mix of energy resources. Before turning the call over to Dan for a financial update, I'd like to provide an update on Vogtle Unit 4. We continue to make meaningful progress toward the completion of Unit 4 with initial criticality achieved yesterday. Initial criticality represents a key step during start-up, whereby operators for the first time safely begin the self-sustaining nuclear reaction to create heat for steam production. As we approach the initial sync with the grid, Unit 4 continues with the remaining start-up and preoperational testing activities that precede the declaration of in-service, which is projected in the second quarter of 2024. Our 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance range, which Dan will get you all shortly assumes Unit 4 achieves commercial operation in April. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you."", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted earnings per share of $3.65 for 2023, which was the very top of our 2023 guidance range. The primary drivers of our performance compared to 2022 are higher utility revenues and lower nonfuel O&M expenses and income taxes, somewhat offset by higher depreciation and interest expenses. Mild weather was also a significant headwind with 2023 marking the mildest year in our history for our electric service territories. Our ability to deliver 2023 adjusted results at the very top of guidance is a great testament to our team and to the resilience and strength of our portfolio of companies. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results compared back to 2022 is included in today's release and earnings package. Turning now to electricity sales in the economy. Weather-adjusted retail electric sales were down 0.4% for 2023 compared to 2022. Strong usage drove commercial sales growth of 1.3% for the year, which was partially offset by lower residential usage with both commercial and residential sales impacted by the return to the office dynamic. We continue to see robust residential customer growth with the addition of over 46,000 residential electric customers and nearly 27,000 residential gas customers. Since 2020, we've added over 200,000 residential electric customers, which represents the highest 4-year total in decades. Industrial sales finished down for the year nearly 2%, largely due to continued slowing in housing and construction-related sectors as well as lower sales to chemical companies due to outages and long-planned plant closures. Consistent with the drivers detailed in Georgia Power's recently filed 2023 Integrated Resource Plan update, economic development in our Southeast service territory remains incredibly strong. Several years of extraordinary success in attracting new and expanding businesses to our states underpins our long-term electricity sales forecast. While electricity sales growth is projected to remain around 1% to 2% for 2024 and 2025, growth from 2025 to 2028 is projected to accelerate to an average of approximately 6% annually, with Georgia Power's total retail electric sales growth projected to be approximately 9% annually over this same period. The magnitude and velocity of this growth are significant drivers for the increased capital investments reflected in our current outlook. This projected growth also represents a tremendous opportunity to de-risk our outlook and benefit customers as the substantial projected growth in kilowatt hour sales from new manufacturing facilities and data centers has the potential to put downward pressure on existing customers' rates. Turning now to our earnings projections for 2024 and beyond. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2024 is $3.95 to $4.05, and our projected long-term adjusted EPS growth rate is 5% to 7% from that range. In early 2021, we provided the investment community with a stable post-Vogtle 3 and 4 construction and EPS projection with an initial and reasonably wide 2024 guidance range. It is perhaps the greatest of understatements to say that the world has changed a lot since early 2021. On a macro basis, we've seen significant inflation and higher and then higher-for-longer interest rates, which alone has translated to interest expense for 2024 hundreds of millions of dollars higher than any of us assumed 3 years ago. Additionally, relative to our projection in early 2021, the projected in-service date for Vogtle 4 moved into 2024 from 2023. In the face of these challenges, we've continued to work extremely hard to grow our business and to create value for investors. Compared to our projections in early 2021, our state-regulated utility rate base for 2024 is projected to be approximately $6 billion higher, while lower O&M expenses and higher sales are projected to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars more than previously projected to help maintain affordability and help pay for those investments. We estimated adjusted earnings of $0.90 per share for the first quarter of 2024. Our capital investment plan continues to be well over 95% attributable to our state-regulated utility businesses. The current 5-year capital investment forecast, totaling $48 billion, reflects a $5 billion increase in state-regulated utility investments relative to our forecast a year ago. This 12% increase in capital spending reflects our ongoing efforts to further increase the resiliency of our electric and gas networks and our technology infrastructure. It also partially reflects new resources proposed in Georgia Power's 2023 IRP update, about 60% of the brick-and-mortar megawatts proposed. We have maintained our disciplined measured approach to capital forecasting for our state-regulated utility businesses. Given the magnitude of change in our projected sales growth and the timeframe in which new resources are needed to serve higher peak demands, we felt it was appropriate to go ahead and reflect certain new resources in our capital plan. Additionally, our capital investment forecast tend to grow, especially in the later years as the visibility into customer additions improves, regulatory processes unfold, compliance obligations evolve, and our long-term integrated system planning is refined. While the increases in this year's 5-year forecast represent an outsized upward adjustment due to the scale and velocity of the projected growth in the near term, we do believe it's reasonable to expect a historical trend of capital increases to continue going forward. On its own, our capital investment forecast of $48 billion supports annualized state-regulated rate base growth of approximately 6%, providing a solid foundation for our long-term outlook. Any upside to the capital forecast will simply serve to add durability to an already strong outlook. Strong investment-grade credit ratings remain a priority. We continue to believe that in order to be a high-quality equity investment, a company must also have high-quality credit. As we near completion of Vogtle Unit 4, the reduction in major project construction risk and the improvement in our FFO should strengthen and meaningfully improve our credit profile to help ensure we preserve what we believe will be a positively differentiated profile.We are also turning on our internal equity plans to fund the incremental capital investment at our subsidiaries that I highlighted earlier. These plans typically provide approximately $350 million of new equity annually. Additionally, we'll preserve our financing flexibility and optionality with a continuous focus on preserving and improving shareholder value. For example, we will continue to maintain an at-the-market or ATM plan to partially finance potential additional increases in capital spending in our subsidiaries or potentially, to partially refinance callable hybrid securities if we determine doing so preserves or improves our credit and long-term EPS objectives. Southern Company strives to deliver a superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return, and we believe the plan that we've laid out supports that objective. Our customer and community-focused business model, the growing investments in our premier state-regulated utility franchises, and the priority that we place on strong credit quality and our remarkable dividend history all contributes toward making Southern Company a premier investment. Chris, I'll now turn the call back over to you."", 'Christopher C. Womack', ""Thank you, Dan. Again, let me say, Southern Company had an exceptional year in 2023. We didn't just meet challenges head on, we rose above them while remaining committed to keeping customers and communities in the center of everything that we do. I am extraordinarily proud of the hard work, the collaboration, the perseverance and the leadership that our teams show throughout the year to enable us to achieve these outstanding results. Having a team prepared to rise to such new heights doesn't just happen. For decades, Southern Company has prioritized investing in our people, with a focus on positioning our leaders and their teams to provide the exceptional service customers expect, to deliver the innovative solutions needed in an evolving energy landscape and to support growing the communities we are privileged to serve. As you all know, our company implemented a leadership transition in early 2023. Rather than simply fill a handful of vacant seats, we embraced it as a grand opportunity. During 2023, we facilitated 75 officer-level changes throughout the company. The changes brought renewed energy and excitement, and more importantly and intentionally, the move has served to further strengthen what we believe to be the deepest and best bench in the industry. I am excited about the future of this company, and I'm excited about our team and its ability to deliver the results all our stakeholders, customers and investors alike expect from Southern Company. Thank you again for joining us this afternoon and for your continued interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first phone question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.', 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Just quickly on the new guidance that you rolled forward. Does the new '24 estimate range still include a Vogtle charge? So should we be adding back $0.05 or so to grow off the 5% to 7% like you've talked about in the past? And sort of that new 6% rate base growth estimate now comes with equity. I guess, what's the comfort level of hitting the midpoint of that EPS growth range, which you just reiterated?"", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Shar. And I know there's a lot of focus on this. I think we're always fascinated with the precision with which everyone wants to inhale all this down.The -- so let's start with the guidance range. Yes, it absolutely includes impacts from Vogtle 4, not only being in '24 at all, but certainly going into, as we've assumed in the guidance range, April. I mean, if you add all that up, that's $0.08 of incremental impact on 2024 relative to what it would have been if the project was in line in 2023. And -- but we haven't adjusted our range by that full amount, by any means. And what we're doing is using the flexibility, not unlike what we did in 2023 with the mildest year ever to kind of mitigate that. Those are the kind of mitigations and flexibility items that aren't necessarily available every year. You have to maintain the system. You've got to make sure you're prioritizing service to customers. And so that flexibility is limited. We're using it this year, and that will diminish what we have the opportunity to do going forward. But also, I think what's not factored in is a couple of other important nuances. We thought 40 slides was enough, but maybe we needed one more slide to kind of draw how we always think about our guidance range and our growth range. We don't think about the 5% to 7% being off of the midpoint. We've always kind of drawn those trajectories off the top of it and off the bottom of it. So 7% off the top, 5% off the bottom. I think if you do that from this current range, it captures every reasonable estimate that's out there for 2025 and 2026. When it comes to the rate base growth, look, we were at 6% last year. We just added $5 billion of capital to the plan. We didn't add all the capital that we see as possible. That kind of incremental capital additions opportunity still exists. So yes, our ability to grow rate base, and yes, it's mitigated ever so slightly by a fraction of a percent of increased shares over time. Our ability to hit our numbers is as solid as it's ever been."", 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Got it. Okay. That's helpful, Dan. And then just lastly, I know one of your peers has spoken pretty extensively on sort of nuclear PTCs and obviously expects to receive hundreds of millions of dollars a year to fund sort of that capital plan. I guess, does the plan today -- do you expect to receive anything material on the nuclear PTC fund? Is it part of any of your credit metrics or funding plans?"", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. We -- yes, thanks, Shar. We have not factored any cash flow from nuclear PTCs into our outlook. We've got a terrific plan with an improving FFO-to-debt metric that's several hundred basis points above any of our threshold over time and frankly improves every year in the forecast that I look at without those nuclear PTCs. Is there the opportunity for us to capture some of those PTCs? We think there very well could be. We're not counting on it. And to the extent we do, we'll flow those to customers in the most practical amount of time possible. And so we're -- it's not going to be a factor in kind of how our metrics or earnings look."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.', 'Steven Isaac Fleishman', ""So just -- I think you've talked about targeting a 17% FFO to debt, which is differentiated. When do you expect you'll be there, let's say, in 2025, when you have first full year of Vogtle, both units running? When do you expect to be there?"", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. So I've always kind of said, we see a forecast that gets us to 17-ish as the way I've characterized it in the past. So let me tell you where we are, Steve, here today, and I think it's still differentiated and a terrific story. And we're doing everything we can to make sure we're being conservative in the way we think about this. So if we just think about Moody's metrics, our actual result for 2023 was 14%. Keep in mind, that's before Vogtle 4 is in service. 2024, with Vogtle in service on the timeline, we believe those metrics will improve by more than 100 basis points in 2024. The weight of the incremental capital that we're deploying and the fact that some of this is kind of long-life construction, you think about building new gas plants at Georgia or other things, there's a bit of regulatory lag that weighs a little bit on credit metrics. And as that resolves itself, cash flow improves. So with the forecast that I see go from 14% to over 15% in '24 and about a 50 to 60 basis point improvement every year after that over time, and that's a function of that capital, it's -- we're issuing the equity to kind of continue the improvement. And then there's a little bit of impact in the short term for under-recovered fuel that as that gets collected and the debt goes away, that also kind of adds to that upward trajectory. So in my 5-year forecast, we get kind of in that mid-16% towards 17% range. But again, every year in the 5 years is an improving story. And still, hundreds of basis points above our thresholds."", 'Steven Isaac Fleishman', ""Great. And my other question, just the -- I mean the -- can you just talk to this growth, particularly, I guess, in Georgia, the 9% a year sales growth, which is -- at least, seems kind of unprecedented, at least for my lifetime in this. Well, I just -- I guess, just how are you differentiating kind of proposed growth projects between ones that are in your plan or ones that you're kind of holding back from because you're not sure they're going to happen? And just -- is this a conservative risk-adjusted number? Or how should I think about that? How are you doing it with those peers because it's so huge?"", 'Christopher C. Womack', ""Yes, it is an unprecedented growth that we continue to witness from economic development activities. And so yes, this is a very conservative look. I mean we look for -- we factor in build permits, building permits in terms of actual announcements of ground has been broken. I mean, so we look at not just companies that are forward looking and making site visits, but there's been some demonstrated commitment that they will, in fact, be building a project in the state. So we go through those thresholds before we make those filings in terms of being -- having some certainty that these projects are, in fact, real. We've just seen unprecedented economic development activity, say, for the past 3 years. And we continue to have an aggressive pipeline. But as we go to the commission for this updated IRP, we just factored in those companies, those businesses that have clearly demonstrated and taken actions that we think of -- that shows some firmness in their participation in their operating businesses in the state."", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. And I'll just add to that, that the momentum in the economic development activity has continued even since filing that 2023 IRP update. And so thank goodness, we've got a filing in 2025, and we do this periodically. It's going to continue to evolve. There's a lot still lingering out there that, in our conservative nature, we're not counting on yet, but it's not unlikely."", 'Christopher C. Womack', 'Yes. But Steve, this is a very conservative look as we make these decisions.', 'Steven Isaac Fleishman', 'And then just one last thing on this. The 9%, since everybody is very focused on data center growth, like how much of it is data centers relative to manufacturing or other growth?', 'Christopher C. Womack', 'Data centers represent right now, we think, somewhere around 80% of that emerging load.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs.', 'Carly S. Davenport', ""Maybe just to start on the new 5-year plan, could you just talk a little bit about what drove the assumptions you made around including some of that spend on the incremental resource needs in the Georgia IRP? And then with the commission order sort of expected there in April, how would you think about updating the capital plan if it's necessary after that decision?"", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes, Carly, it's a great question. So -- and I think I alluded to this a few minutes ago, it really is about the velocity and magnitude of this growth that we just kind of characterized for Steve. It's right in front of us. These resources are needed sooner than later. And so we think there's -- it was reasonable to kind of break trend for us a little bit and get slightly ahead of regulatory outcome to reflect directionally what's happening. And so just to kind of peel the curtain back a little bit, we were very specific in what we included. If you go back and look at the proposal that Georgia Power put in front of the commission back in the fall, it included a lot of various owned resources. And what we've included in the capital plan is essentially the new combustion turbines, there's 3 of those, and then 2 specific storage projects that are kind of located near military bases and [moving us off Air Force space]. That leaves hundreds, I think, over 800 megawatts of storage projects and a small storage of solar kind of not included in there. We will get a decision in April. But again, as a reminder, there's a whole another process coming in 2025. So there may be a degree of clarity in April. There may be further clarity coming out of the '25 process. And as those play out, we'll continue to obviously keep the investment community apprised and update our projections accordingly."", 'Carly S. Davenport', ""Great. That's super helpful. And then maybe just as we think about executing on Vogtle Unit 4. Just any insights on kind of the near-term milestones that we might get updates on that we can gauge project progress there? And then to the extent that the timeline does slip beyond kind of the April that's embedded into current guidance, can you talk a little bit about some of the levers that you might have to pull there to sort of offset those impacts?"", 'Christopher C. Womack', ""Yes. Carly, let me start by saying with initial criticality achieved yesterday, we continue to progress through testing and start-up. The next major milestone is sync-ing to the grid, and that could occur later this month. We expect Unit 4 completion during the second quarter. And as we take into account the experiences we got from last year with our Unit 3, as we look at moving through Unit 4, and we could have worked through these units -- how we work through these issues that could arise. But we view this as a long-term investment and we'll make sure we're taking time to get it right. But right now, as we look at where we are, we are planning on the unit being online in April, and we think we have a number of weeks of margin to accomplish that objective."", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. And Carly, I'll speak to the flexibility. I mean, obviously, I mentioned earlier, we're kind of already deploying some of that flexibility to address what we expect to be [us here] today in April in service because beyond that, we've laid out -- it's roughly $0.03 for every month. But that's partially why we have a range, right? I mean it's a $0.10 range out there. So it could be a function of moving us within the range for the year or depending on the circumstances as the year plays out, whether it's weather or something else, we might have some greater degree of flexibility. It's just too early in the year to really be that detailed about exactly how that might play out."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.', 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', ""A couple of quick questions, following up on what you guys have said of late. Just on this big number on sales growth. Just to clarify, I mean, in your forecast, I know you've got this pending IRP that technically lines up against that sales. Are you seeing an improving ROE in the outlook? Or is this really underpinned at this point by just the IRP? And to the extent at which the IRP doesn't fully reflect that sales outlook, is there something more to go as you work through the process? Question one, if you will."", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""So I'm not sure where you're headed with improved ROE. Maybe clarify that."", 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', 'Just from improving returns from the additional sales, if you will.', 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Certainly, not improving returns from an overall, say, regulated utility perspective. From a -- we really view that as the opportunity to kind of put downward pressure on existing customers' rates. I mean, our objective from an ROE perspective is regular, predictable, sustainable. I think you'll continue to see it play out that way.Just to be clear, Julien, on the sales growth that we've laid out here, so this is roughly 6% in the long term for Southern, that 9% number for Georgia Power, this is actually based on a more conservative view than what's in the IRP update because the IRP update had to put some degree of expectation for additional success from an economic development perspective so that we do stay ahead of this from a resource perspective. It's not a huge differential, but what it also kind of reinforces is as this continues to play out, those numbers have the potential to continue to go up."", 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', ""Yes. Excellent. And then just pivoting back to the FFO to debt quickly. I mean, the 17% that you guys were talking about once, I mean, what is -- has that changed at all? Just in terms of how you're thinking about pro forma for V4 -- Vogtle 4 coming on?"", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""No, nothing's changed in terms of what I believe the financial profile supports which, again, my objectives, I've said this before, I think the -- our parent company being at BBB+, kind of the A category for all the utilities, I think the profile we see ahead of us fully supports that. The only thing that's changed is a slightly slower ramp-up in those metrics because of the incremental capital that we're deploying. But in terms of where we stand relative to any of our thresholds, it's several hundred basis points above any of those in every year, and every year improves."", 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', ""Wonderful. And then just quickly on the reactor cooler pumps, I know there was a little bit of talk in the K here. What's sort of the status on V4? And then just to the extent to which that there is some root cause impact on some of the other -- there's a need to evaluate the adjacent reactor cooler pumps, if you will. I know there's some language in the K on it."", 'Christopher C. Womack', ""Yes. And so yes, we've done all the analysis. We sent the pump back to the manufacturer. And we think we identified the cause of the issue, but a root cause analysis has not been performed yet. But we have tested all the other pumps. And with the new pump, we made sure there were not any similar issues, but we think we're in pretty good shape with the pumps as we go forward."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays.', 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""I guess, just a follow up on the question that Julien had on the root cause. I think you just mentioned the possibility of having to go look back at Unit 3 pumps in the K. And just what's the actual risk [affecting] the line? And when is that no longer going to be an issue?"", 'Christopher C. Womack', ""I guess, as we have looked at the pump that we sent to the manufacturer, as we identified what we thought the issue was, we think it's not an issue with the other pumps. I mean, we test the other pumps. We assessed the pump, the new pump that we installed. And we think we just have a good handle. And on these pumps, I think you consider the run time. I think that provides good color to kind of, I guess, the confidence we have in the pump and what we've identified as the issues and things we have to do to make sure we don't have similar issues as we go forward."", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. I think globally, there's 24 of these things running like a champ right now."", 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""Absolutely. Yes, that's helpful. And then just on the capital plan and reflecting roughly 60% of the IRP, I know that you kind of get a decision in the first half of this year. So just how do we kind of think about tweaks to the financing plan? Is it just going to be another fourth quarter update this time next year? Or is there a mid-period opportunity in the cards?"", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Look, none of these regulatory outcomes will be -- they'll all be in the light of day. I think it will be clear what's approved and what's yet to be approved. I kind of laid out what we've included already, which is those combustion turbines and 2 very specific storage projects. And so I think we'll be able to provide color along the way. We'll certainly do more formal updates every year as we normally do, but I think there'll be interim opportunities. And the other interim opportunity that will continue to exist is we've remained extremely conservative when it comes to owning in renewables in any of our electric service territories. We also are very optimistic that, that will happen. And as that gets clarity, we'll make sure that, that's known as well."", 'Christopher C. Womack', ""But you'll also see great transparency through this process, man, as the commission in Georgia works through the process. I mean the staff is filing testimony today, and they may have a different perspective. But you'll see that process play out, and that lead us to the decision in April by the commission. But you've seen these IRP processes before. So those processes will continue as we go forward, and you'll see real time kind of how it unfolds."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.', 'David Keith Arcaro', ""Let's see. Thinking about that load growth trajectory, is 6% rate base growth still the right kind of parameter to think about longer term? 6% load growth, 6% rate base growth, is that enough to kind of handle the system strain, the generation need, this strain on the T&D system over time? Or is there potential upward growth rate pressure on that rate base growth number as you get into later years of this decade?"", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. Look, I think, Dave, what we've tried to imply is there certainly is upward potential here. We've remained incredibly conservative and measured in how we forecasted. We're not trying to get too far ahead of any regulatory processes. We'll get these decisions in April. We'll have a 2025 process. We believe there's more economic development activity that is likely to come to fruition. And so given all of that, it is certainly not unreasonable that our capital budget will continue to rise to serve that incremental load. And so there certainly could be upward, using your words, pressure on that rate base."", 'David Keith Arcaro', ""Got it. That makes sense. And I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on how you're thinking about the rate impacts coming from that load growth. Are these low-priced new commercial customers, when you're thinking about data center and manufacturing customers, such that there is a lot of grid investment that has to be covered by others within the system or other opportunities here? It sounded like you kind of see the opposite where you're bringing in a lot of revenue that ends up being downward pressure on the rest of the system. So I'm wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on how you see rates progressing over time."", 'Daniel S. Tucker', 'Yes. No, go ahead, Chris.', 'Christopher C. Womack', ""No, we do expect to see rate decreases for our customers with these additional sales and the customer growth that we'll experience. We think that should more than offset the cost of the resources needed to serve. And so we -- affordability is something we pay a lot of attention to, and there are things we do internal. But we think that one of the benefits of this sales growth is having the opportunity to put downward pressure on rates for our customers across the board. And so that's kind of how we see it and how we evaluate each project. I want to make sure that is, in fact, putting downward pressure on rates."", 'Daniel S. Tucker', 'If you think about where probably every utility company was a year ago, one of the greatest risks facing all of us was affordability. We see this as a tremendous opportunity to de-risk our outlook.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.', 'Jeremy Bryan Tonet', ""Just wanted to come in, I guess, on the debt funding side, if I could start. I understand the Georgia Power debt funding increase driven by the IRP there. But at the holdco, just wondering what's the main contributor to the kind of big step-up there of expected debt issuance? It looks like several billion in the 2024 plan now, and I think it was much less than that before. So just kind of curious, I guess, on the holdco debt issuance step-up expectations."", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. So in terms of the change kind of plan versus plan, Jeremy, it's largely driven by the CapEx as well, right? I mean, ultimately, the parent company is funding Georgia Power's equity contribution. And while we're financing that partially with new equity through our plans, certainly -- it's certainly not all being funded directly with new shares. So there's incremental debt there. And then just the overall magnitude of the parent company issuances is largely driven by maturities. Again, if you look a couple of pages beyond, there's, I think, over $5 billion worth of maturities in the same time period. So the amount that's kind of new money is much smaller."", 'Jeremy Bryan Tonet', ""Got it. And just curious if you're able to share any thoughts on the Georgia PSC elections here. Just as far as from what you guys see inside the state for those pending elections, do you expect the ballot in the elections to happen before the November general election? Or do you think it all kind of comes in November? Just kind of curious, I guess, how you think timing could shape up there."", 'Christopher C. Womack', ""I have no idea. I mean that matter is still in the court system. And so we'll observe it, just like you are. But I have no insight into how that's going to play out at this time."", 'Jeremy Bryan Tonet', 'Got it. And just a quick last one, if I could. If you guys are running an RFP process in the Georgia IRP and how you think Southern Power -- Georgia Power stacks up, I guess, in RFP process there?', 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Look, just in answering that, generally, Jeremy, I mean, and we've said this before, the IRA is going to position all of our electric utilities to be much more competitive in these kind of self-build options when it comes to resources. Whether or not it plays out in this particular RFP or it's a subsequent RFP or it's a customer-specific siding, those things will happen over time. But it's also likely a function of something later in the plan. So not a '24, '25, maybe not even '26 kind of a resource. We're talking really towards the back end of the plan where that becomes a real opportunity."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore.', 'Durgesh Chopra', ""Just Dan, is there a way for us to give us a range? And I understand if you can't. But just in terms of the current capital plan, was that the Georgia IRP? What I'm after is what like looks like a successful outcome there as we await the April decision. Just trying to see what is baked into the plan and what to look for in that April decision."", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. It's a fair question, Durgesh. But this is where I want to stop short of getting ahead of any regulatory processes here. We've kind of characterized in terms of the megawatts that we've included that it's roughly 60% of the kind of brick-and-mortar megawatts that were proposed. And so the best way for me to characterize it without getting ahead of anything is just say that the incremental capital associated with what we didn't include won't be lost in the rounding. It's a pretty meaningful number."", 'Durgesh Chopra', ""Understood. I appreciate that, Dan. And then as we think about, just along those lines, incremental CapEx upside. Is there a rule of thumb just again, just for our models, high level, how should we think about it getting financed? You've got some strong load growth. But when we're thinking about higher CapEx, what percentage could be equity finance versus debt? Any sort of guidance there?"", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. I think what we've done with this update is pretty representative of how we think about additional opportunities. So we added $5 billion of capital to this plan. Let's call that $1 billion a year on average. We've added roughly $350 million of equity every year. So that 35% to 40% range is kind of representative of our consolidated equity ratio and represents pretty well what we think is necessary to maintain, if not marginally improve, but really just maintain the credit profile that's already in a really good place."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.', 'Andrew Marc Weisel', ""A couple of quick follow-up questions, really. One, just to clarify, the equity of $350 million per year, that's through '26 in the slides. It kind of sounds like you're saying that's through '28. Should we think of that as just a run rate, $350 million per year going forward, and then potentially more if there's more CapEx?"", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. So what that $350 million represents is us turning on what we refer to as our internal plan. So it's issuing new shares through our DRIP, through our 401(k), and that's about the run rate. And it just happens to match up pretty well with the needs associated with the $5 billion of incremental capital. We typically also maintain an at-the-market plan as flexibility. And so to the extent there's incremental CapEx that emerges, which again is certainly reasonably possible given everything we've described, the ATM is the source that we'll tap into to help finance that."", 'Andrew Marc Weisel', 'Okay. Very good. Next, on the CapEx update. Just to clarify, and sorry if I missed it. Does that include anything for Alabama solar? Or would that be incremental?', 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. No, that would be incremental. There's still no new rate-based solar included. So we've remained conservative in terms of our projections there in the outlook. And hey, just going back, Andrew, real quickly to the equity question. Just to kind of point out, since it maybe wasn't clear because we only put a 3-year financing plan out there, yes, leaving the plans on every year. And on average, kind of the average increase to shares every year is a fraction of a percent. So that's also kind of in the rounding."", 'Andrew Marc Weisel', ""Sounds good. One last one, if I may. Dividend growth, you've been very consistent at $0.08 per share, about 3%. Given the CapEx outlook, is there any point in time at which you might reconsider the trajectory?"", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Another terrific question. So we had kind of alluded to the possibility of reevaluating the rate of dividend growth once we got Vogtle 4 into service and kind of had -- we're kind of in a steady state and into the kind of below 70% somewhere. Given our current circumstances, where we are in a place of issuing equity, perhaps one of the most efficient sources of equity is to remain modest in the way we continue to increase the dividend. So I think for the foreseeable future, the trajectory we've been on is a reasonable expectation for the trajectory we'll remain on."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.', 'Anthony Christopher Crowdell', ""If I could just pitch up one quick one on the data centers and, I guess, the load growth. It seems like we finally are going to get some load growth in this sector, and we're all looking at data centers as help. But it seems that maybe the rate design question, we're all trying to figure out. Typically, a lower-margin customer, large investment requirement. And earlier, you touched on maybe helping with some customer bills. I just -- my question is, if you go deeper into that on -- is it going to be bigger bill impact and bigger fights in rate design? Or you don't think that's an issue?"", 'Christopher C. Womack', ""I mean there's always -- there will always be issues. But I think as we look at increased sales, as we look at growth in customers, and then as we work with these new customers, we think this provides us the opportunity to have downward pressure on rates. And so we will work with many of these customers in terms of their pricing. But once again, I'd just go back to the fundamentals of increased sales opportunity and this customer growth, how that supports the opportunity for us to put downward pressure all across our customer base to see downward pressure on rates. I mean, we'll evaluate each customer to ensure that, in fact, does happen, that they put downward pressure on overall rates across the company."", 'Daniel S. Tucker', 'Yes. And Anthony, what it appears a lot of these data centers are beginning to do is prioritize reliable, resilient service over many other things. That gives us the opportunity to price it appropriately for the benefit of everyone else.', 'Christopher C. Womack', ""And we'll look at the size, the demand, the timing, there are other factors that will go into making sure that we price service appropriately to those customers."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport.', 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""Great. I guess, I know that everybody is asking questions on data centers. But I'm just -- just again, maybe just taking a step back. So when somebody wants to locate a data center in your service territory, do they just get connected to the grid? Or do they develop their own power sources? Do you actually see that they, for instance, have some preference for non-emitting resources? Do they use you more as a backup power source? Again, just -- again, trying to understand the dynamics of those data centers being added to, for instance, in Georgia."", 'Christopher C. Womack', ""Angie, there are a lot of considerations that go into that decision. And yes, we want to connect them to our grid. And yes, we'll have conversations with them about renewable resources and the mix. But those are conversations that we do have with them, recognizing what upgrade may be made on the system locations, where they are. So there are a lot of kind of really detailed conversations, engineering conversations that go into making those final decisions that also then ultimately impact the pricing for that service."", 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""But again, it's not self-supply, right? So they use Georgia Power, for example, as the first source of power?"", 'Christopher C. Womack', ""Absolutely. Yes, that's correct."", 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""Okay. And then secondly, again, I know this question has been asked over and over. Just hard to believe that the load growth is not having a bigger impact on your earnings growth. And again, I don't even imagine this is like an emerging markets sort of pace of load growth, especially for Georgia and those outer years. And yet, there's no impact from -- again, from our vantage point, on your earnings growth. Is it just because the interest expense drag is so pronounced that it absorbs the help that you're getting from higher load growth?"", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes, Angie, it's a few things. Certainly, relative to where we were a year ago, and I think we've said this before, in a higher-for-longer environment, certainly, interest is a bigger headwind going forward. But the bigger dynamic in your question is around what we're actually investing in to serve this load or why we're investing. So keep in mind, the 6% for Southern Company sales growth and 9% for Georgia Power, that's kilowatt hour usage. That's the growth in the total kilowatt hours used. What we invest to do is serve the peaks. And so that looks a little different than the 24/7. We've got a lot of resources. We just may have to incrementally add resources to serve the peaks, and that's what you're seeing largely in the capital deployment. And net-net, we're comfortably in that 5% to 7% growth range."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Paul Fremont with Ladenburg.', 'Paul Basch Michael Fremont', 'Congratulations on the good quarter. Just to clarify, if you were not to get sort of the higher growth rate in sales after 2025, would that have an impact or change -- potentially change your 5% to 7% growth target?', 'Daniel S. Tucker', 'No.', 'Paul Basch Michael Fremont', ""Okay. Great. And then I noticed that the gas capital spending is roughly unchanged. Can you sort of share with us what you're anticipating is going to happen in Illinois? And is there spending that's being shifted from Nicor to any of the other gas subsidiaries?"", 'Christopher C. Womack', ""And yes, I think you got it just right. I mean, we see the opportunities to have some increased capital spending in Atlanta around the operations here in Georgia. So we think that allows that gas investments to be stable going forward. So I think you've spoken to it just right."", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. And any changes in Illinois are modest, to be fair. I mean -- and the outcome there for us, while disappointing, also provided a bit of a road map as to how to be successful going forward in navigating that jurisdiction in terms of just the things we've got to make sure we do as we deploy capital.And keep in mind, a huge, vast majority of the capital that's deployed for Nicor Gas is compliance related. And so there's only so much to kind of not do in the first place."", 'Paul Basch Michael Fremont', 'Great. And then my last question. I mean, generally speaking, when we think of EPS growth, with respect to rate base growth, there tends to be dilution to the rate base to the level of rate base growth because a portion -- or the equity portion is funded either by parent debt or by parent equity. So can you help us sort of understand, at 6% rate base growth, is it possible for you to achieve? Or how would you achieve sort of the high end of your growth target?', 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. Great question, Paul. So again, we were at 6% growth last year in rate base. We've added $5 billion of incremental capital to that. It's -- we kind of characterize it as approximately 6%. But then also, the shares we're issuing, and I think I mentioned this earlier, was that equates to a fraction of a percentage and it's kind of just in the rounding. We feel very comfortable that net-net, how all these things stack up is a conservative achievable forecast."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.', 'Travis Miller', ""You've answered almost all of my questions. I do want to follow up on that dividend. It was one of my questions. Just to clarify what you said, you would expect the dividend growth to stay below earnings growth for at least a couple more years. Did I hear that correctly?"", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. Yes, Travis. You did. And so again, our cadence of growth has been $0.08 per year for several years. I think it's reasonable to expect that to continue. Of course, it's all subject to the Board's oversight and approval. But what that will do is take us, during this high period of CapEx, which hopefully goes on for a very long period of time, brings us comfortably down into the 60s from a payout ratio perspective. And so that's a good place to be, and we'll evaluate every year with what the forecast looks like and what's appropriate. Right now, I think the reasonable expectation is that continued modest growth, which is just below 3%."", 'Travis Miller', 'Yes. Okay, very good. And then obviously, a lot of talk about the demand growth. Put another way, what does demand growth mean for operating cost growth? Is there a tight correlation there if you get 6% or whatever percent annual demand growth? Should we also see a similar increase in operating costs? Or is there not a link there?', 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. There's certainly a relationship. I wouldn't call it a correlation. But to the extent we're building a new gas plant, certainly, that comes along with incremental O&M. To the extent we're building new transmission distribution lines, there's some maintenance component to that. But that's also part of the cost structure that we're ensuring these new rates and revenues will cover, such that the net result is the opportunity to put downward pressure on the existing rates."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi.', 'Ryan Michael Levine', ""With Vogtle's COD targeted for April freeing up some management attention and the personnel changes that were highlighted, do you see any meaningful opportunities to reduce O&M spending below the current guidance as time progresses? Or are these initiatives tabled, given all the opportunity in Georgia via the IRP process?"", 'Christopher C. Womack', ""No. I mean we're always looking across our hand and finding ways to be more efficient. I mean, so there's ongoing efforts to -- once again, as we look at affordability, I mean, we think about the opportunities to keep -- to drive rates from pricing down because of sales growth and because of customer growth, but also making sure that we're focused on looking internally in terms of being more efficient and finding ways to also drive down the cost of our O&M expenses. Also, making sure we take full advantage of fuel pricing. I mean you see where natural gas prices are now. So looking across the entire portfolio, I mean, that is an ongoing continuous exercise that we'll always focus on in terms of finding ways to drive down O&M and find ways to be more efficient."", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. And just as a nuance, all the costs associated with completing Vogtle 3 and 4 is out of capital cost. And so those aren't O&M costs that are an opportunity to reduce."", 'Christopher C. Womack', ""Yes. And the last thing I'd add, even though we've had this focus on Vogtle, but it hasn't kept us from paying attention to the fundamentals, to making sure that we provide the service that customers expect, but also being focused on the cost of our product."", 'Ryan Michael Levine', ""Okay. And then what's the peak hour load growth forecast in Georgia? And how much lower is that than the total kilowatt hour growth number that you cited? And as you're looking to execute on this plan, how -- are there any limitations with supply chains that could constrain growth opportunities via the IRP process?"", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. Look, on supply chain, I think we're in terrific shape, given our scale and just -- we've kind of seen this coming for a little while to the point where we can deploy the resources needed. On your peak question, we'll have to follow up with you on that. Just -- let's connect with the Investor Relations team and get you an answer then."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.', 'Paul Patterson', ""Congratulations on these opportunities that you guys have. Just with respect to the data center stuff, I mean, A, you did indicate in your prepared remarks it seemed that this is based on actual sort of activity, physical construction activity, et cetera. Is it correct to assume that these guys -- these data centers, et cetera, have a price in mind at this -- I mean, they wouldn't be doing this -- I mean, obviously, they're using a large amount of electricity. It's part of the economics of their determination to move that this -- that they know how much they're going to be essentially paying for power if they're doing this, correct?"", 'Christopher C. Womack', ""I think there is -- yes, I mean, they may not know exactly what the price will be. But once again, as we sit with them, understanding their needs, what their desires are and the level of service, I mean that all goes into consideration of what the ultimate price will be. I mean, the value, location, reliability, resiliency, all of those things go into consideration as we kind of price these projects out. And so that's a part of the negotiation. That's a part of the conversation that we have with it."", 'Paul Patterson', 'Okay. In some jurisdictions, because they have their own backup power because they have to be there in case there is an outage or something, they have to get approval from regulatory commissions, their respective state regulatory commissions. Is that the case in Georgia?', 'Christopher C. Womack', 'No. I mean, like I said, I mean, we will -- I mean they will...', 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes, there's some customer-sided programs that have been proposed in the IRP, Paul, that those are being evaluated and those kind of serve the same purpose. But it's not the dynamic that you're describing in those other states."", 'Paul Patterson', ""Okay. Then just roughly speaking, when we're talking about the average data center rate versus the system rate, is there a rule of thumb as to where that kind of is? Do you follow what I'm saying? In other words, I mean how much of a percentage of the average system rate for Georgia Power, let's say, would a data center customer be roughly? I mean, just roughly speaking, like you're getting."", 'Christopher C. Womack', ""I don't think so. I think we may be better informed as we bring some more projects online. Right now, I think -- I don't think that would be the case. And plus, it could be trade secrets as well, so..."", 'Paul Patterson', ""Okay. Then just finally, when we're looking at '26, '27 and '28, in that 9% number, for instance, for Georgia Power, does that go up a lot? Like in other words, is it kind of -- I mean, is '26 -- is '28 a lot higher than '26, if you follow what I'm saying? In other words, it's a 3-year period. The number jumps up a lot in that period. Do you follow what I'm saying? In other words, is it roughly the -- ratable over that period of time? Or is this sort of a hockey stick in terms of what you see in terms of demand growth?"", 'Daniel S. Tucker', ""Yes. It's fairly ratable, Paul. It's obviously not perfectly linear by any means. But that -- the significant load really begins to come in, in, say, late '25 and into '26, which is why a lot of the resource proposals you see at Georgia Power are to really serve the '26, '27 winter peak to make sure they're in place for that, and then it continues to grow from there."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?"", 'Christopher C. Womack', 'Again, let me say, Southern Company had an exceptional year in 2023. And I am really excited about the future of this company. Let me thank everybody for joining us today and wish everybody a happy day, and thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you, sir.

The expansion into renewable energy aligns with global trends and customer demand for sustainable energy solutions, offering a pathway to long-term growth and market leadership."", ""Strategic Acquisitions and Market-Based Rates: Southern Power's strategy to create value through acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests positions the company for strategic growth. By committing to new generating capacity only after securing long-term PPAs, Southern Power mitigates risk and capitalizes on market-based rates, enhancing its competitive edge in the wholesale market."", ""Geopolitical Conflicts and Economic Conditions: Global and U.S. economic conditions, including impacts from geopolitical conflicts, recession, inflation, and financial market conditions, pose significant threats to Southern Co's operations. Economic downturns can affect customer demand and access to capital markets, while geopolitical tensions can exacerbate the risk of physical and cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, potentially leading to operational disruptions and financial losses."", 'Competition and Technological Disruption: The energy sector is experiencing rapid technological changes and increasing competition from alternative energy sources. Southern Co must navigate the competitive landscape by continuously innovating and adapting to technological advancements. The shift towards electrification in various sectors, including transportation and building, may also challenge the demand for natural gas, requiring strategic responses to maintain market share and profitability.', ""In conclusion, Southern Co's SWOT analysis reveals a company with a strong market presence, bolstered by its vertically integrated utilities and diverse energy portfolio. However, it must navigate operational risks, cybersecurity threats, and regulatory challenges. Opportunities for growth lie in renewable energy expansion and strategic acquisitions, while threats from economic conditions and competition must be carefully managed. Southern Co's forward-looking strategies, including its commitment to GHG reduction and market-based rates, position it to leverage its strengths and address its weaknesses in the evolving energy landscape."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

(NASDAQ:LULU) trades at approximately 33 times consensus 2024 earnings per share. Comparably, the S&P 500 trades at approximately 22 times consensus earnings.', 'The retail business is extremely competitive and thus, some investors may question whether this premium valuation is deserved.', 'Legendary investing guru Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) is generally skeptical of retail businesses. In his 1995 annual letter, he said:', '""Retailing is a tough business. During my investment career, I have watched a large number of retailers enjoy terrific growth and superb returns on equity for a period, and then suddenly nosedive, often all the way into bankruptcy. This shooting-star phenomenon is far more common in retailing than it is in manufacturing or service businesses. In part, this is because a retailer must stay smart, day after day. Your competitor is always copying and then topping whatever you do. Shoppers are meanwhile beckoned in every conceivable way to try a stream of new merchants. In retailing, to coast is to fail.""', 'However, Lululemon has defied the odds and proved to be an excellent long-term investment for shareholders. Since becoming a public company in 2007, its shares have delivered a return of more than 3,000%. Comparably, the S&P 500 has returned roughly 373%.', 'LULU Data by GuruFocus', ""The rally has been driven by impressive financial performance. Over the past 10 years, the company has grown both annual revenue and earnings per share at a roughly 20% rate. I believe this strong financial performance can continue and that Lululemon's premium valuation is well deserved."", ""One of Lululemons' biggest growth opportunities is additional stores. As of the third quarter of 2023, it had a total of 686 company-operated stores globally, roughly half of which are in the U.S. The company's second-largest market is China, where it operates 133 stores. Over the past year, Lululemon has opened 63 net new company-operated stores, including 32 in Asia Pacific, 28 in North America and three in Europe. Comparably, Lululemon's closest peer, Nike (NYSE:NKE), operates over 1,000 stores worldwide."", 'I believe international store expansion represents a massive growth opportunity for the company. While retailing internationally is complex, Lululemon has already proved that is it is capable of succeeding and that its brand has appeal outside of North America.', ""Another potential growth driver for the company is new product launches. Lululemon recently announced the launch of its men's footwear product line. Men's footwear represents a massive growth opportunity for the company as the market is very big. The men's sneaker market alone is estimated to be worth roughly $32 billion each year. Even modest success in this market has the potential to drive significant revenue growth for the retailer."", ""Lululemon's men's business more broadly also represents a key potential growth driver. Currently, the company's men's brand awareness in the U.S. is just 13% and is single digits in most other countries. For 2022, men's product sales accounted for just 24% of total revenue."", 'For fiscal 2023, the company is expected to post total revenue of $9.60 billion. Comparably, industry leader Nike posted total revenue of $51 billion. Thus, I believe Lululemon has significant growth potential before reaching saturation.', 'Current consensus estimates call for the company to post earnings per share growth of 14.80% for 2024, 14.60% for 2025 and 12.40% for 2026. Given the potential growth drivers referenced above, I believe Lululemon will have no problem meeting or exceeding these estimates.', ""Lululemon trades at roughly 33 times 2024 earnings. Comparably, Nike trades a roughly 29 times 2024 earnings and 25 times 2025 earnings. Nike's fiscal year ends in May and thus, the 2025 multiple is more comparable to Lululemon's 2024 multiple."", 'Nike has similar near-term growth prospects to Lululemon and is expected to grow earnings per share by a mid-teens percentage annually over the next few years. However, I believe Lululemon has better medium to long-term growth prospects given it currently has much lower market penetration, especially outside of the U.S. Nike generates 57% of its sales outside the U.S., while Lululemon sees approximately 84% of its sales from North America. Historically, the company has tended to trade at a moderate premium valuation relative to Nike and the current premium is toward the low end of the historical difference in valuations.', ""Lululemon's current valuation is also reasonable in the context of its own historical valuation. Over the past few years, the stock has traded at an average forward price-earnings ratio of roughly 37. Thus, the current forward multiple of 33 times 2024 earnings represents a discount to the company's recent historical valuation norm."", 'Based on these considerations, I believe Lululemon is reasonably valued given its strong growth potential.', 'LULU Data by GuruFocus', 'LULU Data by GuruFocus', ""The biggest risk to the bull case is that the brand becomes less attractive to consumers versus competitors. Lululemon competes in a highly competitive marketplace. Key competitors include Nike, Adidas (XTER:ADS), Under Armour (NYSE:UA), Alo Yoga, Athleta and many other companies. Consumer preferences are difficult to predict, but Lululemon's recent momentum suggests it continues to have attractive products relative to peers."", 'Another risk to the bull case is an economic slowdown. Consumer spending on athletic apparel is highly discretionary in nature and an economic slowdown could result in lower revenue and earnings growth than is currently expected.', 'Lululemon is an expensive stock, but has strong long-term growth potential and a history of delivering very strong financial performance.', ""The company has a number of growth drivers, including additional store openings, new product launches and additional market penetration in its men's business."", 'The stock trades at a modest premium valuation to its closet peer, but has better long-term growth prospects. The stock currently trades at a moderate discount to its own historical average.', ""For these reasons, I believe Lululemon's premium valuation is well deserved and the stock is not overvalued at current levels."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

The changes were made after discussions with regulators and will enable the “best demonstration” of vutrisiran, the drug it’s testing in the trial, CEO Yvonne Greenstreet said on a conference call.', 'Still, the adjustments led analysts to question whether the study, which is critical to Alnylam’s future, isn’t going as well as expected. Results are now anticipated in June or July, instead of early 2024. Alnylam shares fell by nearly double digits in early trading Thursday.', 'For Alnylam, a lot is riding on the outcome of HELIOS-B.', 'Analysts think positive results could make vutrisiran a multibillion-dollar product and Alnylam a profitable company. While the drug is already sold as Amvuttra for a rarer form of transthyretin, or ATTR, amyloidosis that affects nerves, the cardiomyopathy type is far more common. The only drug available, Pfizer’s Vyndamax, generated $3.3 billion in sales last year.', 'Success would also help Alnylam rebound from the rejection of another one of its drugs, Onpattro, in ATTR cardiomyopathy, a setback that has shaved off one-fifth of the company’s value. Another drug from BridgeBio Pharma could be approved by the end of the year, heightening pressure on Alynlam.', 'No surprise, then, that changes to the trial’s design caused shares to fall. Alnylam’s executive team spent the entire earnings call Thursday defending their decision.', 'There are three main changes. First, Alnylam is lengthening the study’s minimum follow-up from 30 months to 33 months. A longer study has more statistical power, and the tail end is when Alnylam expects to see the greatest number of “events” — deaths or heart-related hospitalizations — in the trial’s placebo arm, executives said.', 'Additionally, the trial now has two “parallel” main study goals, instead of one. Previously, researchers were measuring whether vutrisisran could reduce the risk of death or cardiovascular events in the overall study population. Alnylam is adding a measurement of the drug’s impact in the 60% of participants who weren’t already on Vyndamax at the trial’s start. The company can declare success if both groups reach statistical significance, or if just one meets a lower statistical threshold. The change “allows us to demonstrate the true impact of vutrisiran,” said chief medical officer Pushkal Garg.', 'Alnylam also trimmed the study’s secondary goals, claiming the ones it has prioritized will better prove whether vutrisiran stops disease-related decline, something Pfizer’s and BridgeBio’s drugs haven’t yet been shown to do.', ""“We have reiterated our confidence over and over again in the study,” said Alnylam president Akshay Vaishnaw. The alterations “further enhance the robustness of what we're going to share with the world.”"", 'Analysts questioned whether Alnylam’s adjustments were the result of a review of blinded data from the study, which might be suggestive of an outcome. However, the company claims its motivation for making the changes was to incorporate lessons from follow-up testing of Onpattro, as well as from BridgeBio’s recent Phase 3 trial.', '“We have teams that are looking at the blinded data,” but “that’s not the driver here,” said Garg. “The primary drivers here are what we understand about science, biology and prior precedent from clinical medicine and clinical trials.“', 'BridgeBio shares climbed 13% by mid-day, while Pfizer’s rose by more than 1%.', 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.

', ""With the first quarter of the 21st century about to be over, the Internet of today is vastly different from the one that had taken shape at the tail end of the dotcom era of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. Now, the Internet proliferates every aspect of life, whether it's transportation, work, entertainment, leisure, or even buying groceries. Additionally, two and a half decades after the start of the new century, a handful of players since the dotcom era have survived and now reign supreme in the stock market."", ""These bigwigs include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). However, 2024 is turning out to be a year that appears to be challenging the dominance of big technology as the market value of the semiconductor designer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has started to rival that of the world's biggest electronic commerce company Amazon and Alphabet, whose search engine reigns supreme in nearly every country in the world."", ""The significant transformation that the Internet has undergone over the course of the past decades also means that now, there are new technologies and industries that were un-thought of when Jeff Bezos first started delivering books. One such technology is blockchain, a secure ledger that gained popularity along with Bitcoin, the world's premier cryptocurrency. The emergence of blockchain technologies, companies, and stocks comes as technology permeates not only our daily lives but also the business operations of giants belonging to crucial industries such as financial services and logistics."", 'A blockchain, for those out of the loop, is a collection of computers that store information. And since running a business requires storing copious amounts of information, it offers companies and management a secure ledge that is stored on multiple computers at the same time to ensure that even if one node of the network goes out of operation, the record integrity remains unaffected.', 'Naturally, this utility that the blockchain industry has slowly grown to be worth quite a bit. For instance, as part of our coverage of 11 Most Promising Blockchain Stocks According to Analysts, we discovered several blockchain stocks that had impressive share price upside. The top three stocks in this list, which ranked the companies by the percentage upside of their average analyst share price targets as of mid December 2023, were Canaan Inc. (NASDAQ:CAN), Applied Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:APLD), and Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR). The share price upside percentage for these blockchain stocks all stood in either double or triple digits, indicating that when it comes to selecting blockchain stocks for investment purposes, at least analysts believe that they offer at least some potential.', 'Delving deeper into the business operations of these top blockchain stocks, it appears that at least when it comes to the top of the food chain for investment recommendations, either companies that sell hardware for blockchain use or those that engage in Bitcoin mining reign supreme. Bitcoin and blockchains are closely tied to each other, since at its simplest level, a Bitcoin is simply a reward token to a miner given for computing resources spent powering up a blockchain network.', 'The next step in our analysis of the blockchain industry and the biggest blockchain companies is to see whether this trend also holds for the most valuable blockchain companies in the world in terms of market capitalization. Some of the most valuable companies, when it comes to either operating blockchains or offering software based products that use the technology are International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).', ""This is unsurprising since all these companies are leaders in the cloud computing space, and each of them offers blockchain based services as well. So while Microsoft is one of the biggest proponents of Web3, a 'new' internet that seeks to run on the blockchain, Alphabet's Google Cloud has been storing Bitcoin mining data for years and the firm itself has invested billions of dollars in the blockchain industry. Similarly, IBM is one of the biggest players in the blockchain industry since it offers companies the ability to build blockchain systems across a myriad of industries such as supply chain management and food product sourcing."", 'As a whole, now that Bitcoin has touched the coveted $1 trillion mark, the next Bitcoin halving is due soon to allow even more miners to profit in the industry, retail players are able to access Bitcoin through exchange traded funds, new areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi) capture the public attention, and GPU supply chain stabilizes in the wake of increased A.I. demand, the blockchain industry might be in for some favorable tailwinds in the coming months.', ""So, with these details in mind, let's take a look at the biggest blockchain companies in the world.

The emergence of blockchain technologies, companies, and stocks comes as technology permeates not only our daily lives but also the business operations of giants belonging to crucial industries such as financial services and logistics."", 'A blockchain, for those out of the loop, is a collection of computers that store information. And since running a business requires storing copious amounts of information, it offers companies and management a secure ledge that is stored on multiple computers at the same time to ensure that even if one node of the network goes out of operation, the record integrity remains unaffected.', 'Naturally, this utility that the blockchain industry has slowly grown to be worth quite a bit.

The top three stocks in this list, which ranked the companies by the percentage upside of their average analyst share price targets as of mid December 2023, were Canaan Inc. (NASDAQ:CAN), Applied Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:APLD), and Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR). The share price upside percentage for these blockchain stocks all stood in either double or triple digits, indicating that when it comes to selecting blockchain stocks for investment purposes, at least analysts believe that they offer at least some potential.', 'Delving deeper into the business operations of these top blockchain stocks, it appears that at least when it comes to the top of the food chain for investment recommendations, either companies that sell hardware for blockchain use or those that engage in Bitcoin mining reign supreme. Bitcoin and blockchains are closely tied to each other, since at its simplest level, a Bitcoin is simply a reward token to a miner given for computing resources spent powering up a blockchain network.', 'The next step in our analysis of the blockchain industry and the biggest blockchain companies is to see whether this trend also holds for the most valuable blockchain companies in the world in terms of market capitalization. Some of the most valuable companies, when it comes to either operating blockchains or offering software based products that use the technology are International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).', ""This is unsurprising since all these companies are leaders in the cloud computing space, and each of them offers blockchain based services as well. So while Microsoft is one of the biggest proponents of Web3, a 'new' internet that seeks to run on the blockchain, Alphabet's Google Cloud has been storing Bitcoin mining data for years and the firm itself has invested billions of dollars in the blockchain industry. Similarly, IBM is one of the biggest players in the blockchain industry since it offers companies the ability to build blockchain systems across a myriad of industries such as supply chain management and food product sourcing."", 'As a whole, now that Bitcoin has touched the coveted $1 trillion mark, the next Bitcoin halving is due soon to allow even more miners to profit in the industry, retail players are able to access Bitcoin through exchange traded funds, new areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi) capture the public attention, and GPU supply chain stabilizes in the wake of increased A.I. demand, the blockchain industry might be in for some favorable tailwinds in the coming months.', ""So, with these details in mind, let's take a look at the biggest blockchain companies in the world.

What are your favorite wines? Do you even drink wine? How long do you like to dine? Do you order dessert? And with that knowledge, it could tailor a customized experience that satisfies the senses.', '""By taking the guesswork out of the actual technical part of taking your order, it allows us to put 100% of our hearts into making you feel welcome,” says Meyer, speaking at an event hosted by IBM at Manhatta, a fine dining restaurant owned by his Union Square Hospitality Group.', 'The Shake Shack founder says artificial intelligence can bring three key benefits to hospitality: increased revenue because restaurants will know more about their guests and how they like to spend, efficiencies to supply-chain and other back-office operations, and helping restaurants provide greater hospitality by focusing more on guests and less on mundane tasks.', '“Any great tech should advance touch,” says Meyer. “And I think hospitality is all about human touch.”', 'We now use our phones to order a coffee while out for a walk or track a delivery driver to the precise moment they will reach our doorstep. Robots are making burrito bowls at Chipotle and Sweetgreen’s salads. And AI is the latest innovation that’s upending how restaurants and diners interact.', 'Much of the focus has been on AI-powered tools that recommend add-ons to an order. McDonald’s and IBM are using AI for drive-through orders, though the response on social media last year was lukewarm. IBM acquired McD Tech Labs from the world’s largest fast-food restaurant chain in 2021, and together, they’ve greatly lifted order automation rates where the tech has been deployed, giving recommendations that are a bit more sophisticated than “Do you want a larger size of fries?”', '“It is really about reducing friction,” says Rob Thomas, IBM’s senior vice president of software and chief commercial officer. ""I believe every company in the world is going to use generative AI for some type of customer service, which is happening pretty significantly today.""', 'But there are limits. “I’m skeptical that AI is going to disrupt or replace creative-type jobs,” Thomas tells Fortune. “I think chefs are all safe.”', 'In November, Yum Brands chief financial officer Chris Turner told investors the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell operator is testing voice-enabled AI drive-throughs in two California restaurants to boost productivity and efficiency, while generating automated upsell recommendations.', 'Dine Brands’ IHOP chain debuted AI recommendation technology for online ordering in August. Google Cloud utilizes years of content across the tech giant’s ads, search, and YouTube to encourage an online order of a steak burger with bacon to perhaps add on a milkshake. Or a side of pancakes to a breakfast order with IHOP.', 'About 20% of IHOP’s business today comes from off premise, a shift in spending that was initially fueled by the pandemic but remains persistent. Kieran Donahue, IHOP’s chief marketing officer, says the chain makes decisions based on the guest perspective, and that’s led to an evolution of the company’s digital strategy, including a loyalty program last year and updates to the website and IHOP app.', '“When you sit in our restaurant and you have a dining experience, our servers are there to help you make some decisions and offer you some suggestions,” says Donahue. “This recommendation engine that we are testing is a bit of a service experiment. It is providing a level of digital service that you might equate to dine-in.”', 'Regardless of whether a user is a loyalty member or not, Google Cloud’s Recommendations AI model is meant to offer a variety of upsell options, which can range from seasonal items to specials to items purchased previously. “Ultimately, the AI engine and the recommendation engine are providing meaningful recommendations for both of those users,” says Jason Suarez, vice president of digital, business intelligence, and CRM engineering at Dine Brands.', 'With nearly 800 locations across 34 states, Checkers and Rally’s began rolling out AI-based drive-thru voice ordering in mid-2021, an investment the company claims made it the first large restaurant concept to utilize AI in this way. Today, over 350 corporate and franchised stores have deployed AI at the drive-through, and over the summer, Checkers added a Spanish-speaking feature.', 'AI won’t be deployed to every location, as some restaurants don’t have a drive-through or high enough volume to justify the cost of adding AI.', '“My philosophy is you don’t innovate just to say you are innovating,” says Minh Le, chief information officer at Checkers and Rally’s. “There has to be a purpose and return. Technology costs money.”', 'Le leaned on AI to help automate some tasks that would make the cashier position less stressful. It is a job where an employee is taking orders, while at the same time processing payments at the window, handing food to customers, and filling drink orders. Burnout can result in low retention. But with as much as 95% of orders automated by AI, cashiers can “focus on the customer at the window and provide better service,” says Le.', 'AI experimentation isn’t limited to large chains. In Kenya, the generative AI craze caught the attention of hospitality entrepreneur Shamim Ehsani. He began to tinker with the tech personally, but quickly utilized it to center the creative concept for a new Thai-style restaurant he would open in Nairobi, called BangBang.', 'BangBang is named after a Muay Thai champion and Hollywood star, whose photos and bio adorn the restaurant’s website and branding. But he isn’t real. BangBang is a completely fictional character, a backstory and images all created by AI, which also helped Ehsani with graphic design, logos, and color choices for the restaurant.', 'Ehsani used Midjourney for the image generation and would ask ChatGPT questions such as “What colors would be good for a Thai restaurant?” and “What fonts should I use for the menu?” And because Ehsani isn’t formally trained on Adobe, he says, AI tools can help supplement some of his technical deficiencies. “With AI, I think it really helps to build on my creativity so that I can deliver what I have in my mind,” says Ehsani.', 'The use of those new AI tools has led to some intellectual property concerns, and Ehsani admits the line is blurred. “We tell our guests that the images are AI-generated,” he says. “It’s important to be upfront and honest about how we use technology and weave it into the guest’s journey.”', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Itay, why did you make that call there? What are you seeing in the market?"", ""ITAY MICHAELI: Well, thank for you for having me. Yeah, we did trim our estimates recently by a modest amount. We still see EV sales actually reaching about 9.5% penetration in 2024 and close to 15% by 2025. That said, given the slowdown and some of the revised plans by the automakers that we've seen announced, plus I would say a tough start to January-- December, we think, was actually a very good month. But just given the slower start in January, we did trim our numbers a little bit."", ""I would say our views are probably still above the current consensus thinking, which has been very bearish on EVs the last few months. We don't completely agree with that. There are some adoption challenges out there. That's reflected into our numbers. But we still think we'll have a pretty good year for EV growth this year on the back of some new product."", ""- And who do you think is going to be the big winner in EVs? And is that going to then determine who's the big winner overall in sales this year?"", 'ITAY MICHAELI: Yeah. So overall, EVs just a small part of the market, but close to 10% we think this year. We do believe, of course, Tesla will remain by far the market leader. Our forecast for market share this year is just under 50%. We think a new product, including the refresh of the Model 3, is going to be key for them this year. Of course, Cybertruck ramping as well.', ""And then General Motors as they ramp their Ultium platform, we think it could be in about 11% market share. So sort of the first sort of non-Tesla automaker with a double digit market share this year as they ramp that platform. We think we need more product in the EV market. If you look at just some of the market coverage to date, it's pretty uneven in certain segments, and certainly in certain price points."", ""And one thing to keep in mind in the whole EV debate that's very important is in the US, we have on average about two vehicles per household. So the burden of EV adoption isn't about changing one's entire lifestyle to go all in on EV initially. It's really about converting households largely to one combustion or ICE and maybe a second one with EV."", 'And if that starts to happen, you could see in theory a pretty rapid uptake of EV adoption over the next few years. But you need additional product. Of course, you do need better EV charging infrastructure, lower pricing, which IRA should help to some extent this year as well.

Adjusted net income came in at 18.6 billion euros ($20.04 billion) vs. 18.4 billion euros ($19.83 billion) expected, up 11% compared to a year ago. Adjusted operating income rose 1% to 24.3 billion euros ($26.2 billion) with adjusted operating income margin of 12.8%', 'The Netherlands-based Stellantis, the last Big Three automaker to report earnings this cycle, also said it will repurchase 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) of shares this year, adding to a buyback from last year. The company also announced a dividend of 1.55 euros ($1.67) per share, up 16% compared to last year.', 'On the downside, the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike that lingered into October hit operating margins, with its adjusted operating income margin dropping to 11.2% in the second half of the year from 12.3% in the same period in 2022. This led the adjusted operating income for the second half of the year to slide 10% to 10.2 billion euros ($10.9 billion).', 'Stellantis previously said the strikes hit profits by $808.1 million last year and by approximately $3.23 billion in terms of revenue. But because of higher pricing power, the post-strike labor costs won’t affect Stellantis as much as they will Ford (F) or GM (GM). ""So the impact for us is certainly going to be on an overall level lower than what you\'ve seen from our peers,"" CFO Natalie Knight said in a media call.', 'Looking ahead, Stellantis projected a minimum commitment of double-digit adjusted operating income margin in 2024 and positive industrial cash flow but warned of a tough year ahead.', '""There’s a much more normalized supply environment, a much more normalized pricing environment than what we’ve seen in the past,"" Knight said in the media call. ""We’re resilient for what we think is going to be a pretty turbulent year."" She added on the earnings call that ""there\'s more headwinds that there are tailwinds.""', 'In its presentation, Stellantis said headwinds included factors like the impact of the EV product mix, lower prices, and labor costs that would weigh on the adjusted operating income margin in 2024.', ""On the flip side, Stellantis' measured approach to EVs is paying off for the automaker, as it didn’t go all in on full EVs. Stellantis said it is No. 1 in PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric) sales in the US (136,000), doubling sales year over year, with industry-leading margins for its cars in the US. Models like the Jeep Wrangler and Grand Cherokee 4xe PHEVs have been selling well, though the company will have its fully electric Jeep Wagoneer S going on sale in the fall of this year."", 'CEO Carlos Tavares touted the new upcoming 2025 Ram 1500 pickup on the earnings call, as well as versions of the truck that will offer a fully electric powertrain and 500 miles of range and a ""Ramcharger"" version that operates similar to a plug-in hybrid.', 'Tavares was criticized in the past for not moving faster with the company’s EV transition; now he is looking somewhat prescient as demand for EVs has seemingly waned in recent months. Tavares did say the present plan is to keep its Dare Forward EV transition going ""flat out"" as the EV transition is still expected to happen, though more gradually.', 'Part of that plan meant using platforms that could accommodate both pure electric and gas-powered powertrains while other legacy automakers have pursued different dedicated platforms. Tavares said shared platforms are the best approach from a cost perspective.', '""The benefit to the consumer of having a dedicated [EV] platform is almost nil compared to the diversity complexity that you generate [with shared platforms],"" he said. ""Despite the criticism, it happens that in an uncertain world today, it\'s the right decision.""', 'Tavares also warned of a growing EV competition from China.', '""The margin parity [between EVs and gas-powered cars] is something that we believe we need to do, and we believe we need to do it fast because it is the best protection against the Chinese offensive,"" Tavares said.', 'And that also means profitability with EVs. Tavares said Stellantis EVs on sale in Europe are already profitable and that the company is aiming for profitability in North America in 2025.', 'In terms of its rivals this earnings season, shares of fellow Big Three automakers Ford and GM have surged following strong earnings reports, as the two Michigan-based automakers’ traditional gas-powered businesses are projecting robust profits for 2024.', 'Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Meaning, you will need to purchase Target's shares before the 20th of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 10th of March."", ""The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.10 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$4.40 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Target has a trailing yield of approximately 3.0% on its current stock price of US$145.03. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing."", ' View our latest analysis for Target ', 'If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Target paid out 55% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Over the last year it paid out 55% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.', ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. This is why it's a relief to see Target earnings per share are up 8.1% per annum over the last five years. Decent historical earnings per share growth suggests Target has been effectively growing value for shareholders. However, it's now paying out more than half its earnings as dividends. If management lifts the payout ratio further, we'd take this as a tacit signal that the company's growth prospects are slowing."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Target has delivered 12% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""Has Target got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have been growing modestly and Target paid out a bit over half of its earnings and free cash flow last year. It might be worth researching if the company is reinvesting in growth projects that could grow earnings and dividends in the future, but for now we're not all that optimistic on its dividend prospects."", ""If you're not too concerned about Target's ability to pay dividends, you should still be mindful of some of the other risks that this business faces.

The U.S. consumer price index for January was up 0.3% month-over-month and 3.1% on a year-over-year basis. This compared unfavorably with broad-based expectations of 0.2% and 2.95, respectively."", 'Earlier, the Fed had pledged to cut interest rates several times in 2024 owing to a decelerating inflation trend in the later stages of 2023.

And these emotional responses, or rather mistakes, make the momentum strategy work.', 'For example, some investors are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in prices.

Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such errors in judgment.', 'Furthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they have a habit of going with the flow and overreacting, causing dramatic price reactions. These behavioral problems extend trends, thus opening up huge opportunities for momentum players.', 'To sum up, momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future.

But the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) share price is up 78% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. In comparison, the share price is down 3.2% in a year.', ""While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment."", ' View our latest analysis for Analog Devices ', 'While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.', 'During five years of share price growth, Analog Devices achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 12% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.', ""The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers)."", 'We know that Analog Devices has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.', ""As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Analog Devices' TSR for the last 5 years was 96%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""While the broader market gained around 23% in the last year, Analog Devices shareholders lost 1.4% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 14% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Analog Devices  that you should be aware of."", 'Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Both of these giants of the telecom industry experienced share-price gains going into 2024. Verizon even hit a 52-week high of $43.21 at the end of January.', 'The pair also sport attractive dividend yields over 6% at the time of this writing. And both experienced a dip in stock price recently, so now seems like a good time to buy shares in these telecom titans.', ""But if you could choose only one to invest in, which would it be? The answer isn't straightforward and requires looking into both companies in more detail. This can help you assess which is the better investment right now."", 'AT&T spent the last few years transforming its business, divesting entertainment assets such as its Warner Media operations. So 2023 was the first full year that AT&T operated strictly as a telecommunications company. And it was a solid year for the telecom stalwart.', ""The company's mobile-wireless business saw revenue grow by 2.7% year over year, contributing $84 billion of AT&T's $122.4 billion in 2023 sales. Meanwhile, its broadband revenue experienced excellent 8% growth over 2022, reaching $10.5 billion."", ""These year-over-year sales gains led to AT&T's free cash flow (FCF) increasing to $16.8 billion in 2023, up from $14.1 billion in 2022. FCF provides insight into a company's cash available for activities such as investing in its business, funding its dividend, and paying down debt."", ""AT&T's debt is one area weighing on the company's stock. Exiting 2023, AT&T's net debt was a massive $128.9 billion. That means a portion of the company's FCF will be tied up for a while to pay down this debt."", 'Yet a positive sign is AT&T targeting a net debt-to-adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) ratio in the 2.5 range some time in the first half of next year. Hitting this goal would bring its debt burden down to a more manageable level.', ""Verizon also has amassed a substantial debt load. At the end of 2023, its net debt was $126.4 billion. But unlike AT&T, Verizon's net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio is already at 2.6, so Verizon is ahead of its rival in getting its debt under control."", 'However, Verizon has struggled to capture customers in the postpaid phone-subscriber segment, losing out to AT&T throughout 2023. Postpaid subscribers are the most valued customer segment in the telecom industry.', 'On the bright side, Verizon managed to recoup its postpaid phone-customer losses in the fourth quarter, providing the company with some momentum as it entered 2024.', ""In addition, Verizon's free cash flow reached $18.7 billion in 2023, substantially higher than AT&T's $16.8 billion. Verizon's superior FCF puts it in a stronger position than AT&T to continue reducing debt and maintain its dividend."", ""Verizon's FCF increase is thanks in part to growth in its wireless-service sales, which hit $76.7 billion in 2023, a year-over-year increase of 3.2%. This income is key since it comprised the majority of the company's $134 billion in 2023 revenue."", ""Both AT&T and Verizon possess qualities that make them compelling investments. The former's success capturing customers in the key postpaid phone-subscriber segment is a strength, while Verizon's superior FCF means a more financially secure dividend."", 'And on that note, although both offer similar dividend yields, Verizon has raised its dividend for 17 consecutive years. Meanwhile, AT&T has not raised its dividend since cutting it in 2022 as part of its divestiture of entertainment assets.', ""Moreover, Verizon's 2023 sales of $134 billion eclipsed AT&T's $122.4 billion, enabling higher FCF, which contributed to Verizon's ability to raise its dividend. Verizon also closed out 2023 with an impressive improvement in postpaid phone subscribers during the fourth quarter."", 'Given these factors, right now Verizon looks like the superior long-term investment between these two telecom titans, especially for passive income.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Verizon Communications wasn’t one of them.

A major part of the platform is “Talent GPS,” which helps workers identify other roles they’re interested in, what skills or experience the roles require, and how they can develop that experience.', 'Introducing this platform also meant revamping Verizon’s internal jobs hierarchy. The company overhauled its job taxonomy, creating fewer job categories, and reducing the total number of job codes from 70,000 titles to just 2,100, along with clear descriptions of the responsibilities, skills, and experiences needed for each title. Hammock says the whole endeavor took her team more than a year.', 'Benefits', 'Verizon workers, and frontline employees in particular, say a major reason they stay at the company is the benefits, according to Hammock.', 'Referred to as the total rewards package, employees like the financial benefits in particular, which include tuition assistance, an employee stock equity program called “Stock Together,” as well as short-term and long-term financial planning education, including access to coaches and advisors.', ""Verizon recently also started offering a benefit called “Secure Your Future,” where the company matches employees' student loan payments as 401(k) contributions—a new benefits solution available to employers thanks to the SECURE 2.0 Act."", 'More support for tuition repayment was one of the top requested benefits from employees in an internal study conducted in late 2022, Hammock says. More than 500 workers signed up for “Secure Your Future” the first day it was available in December, and more than 1,450 employees have enrolled.', ""“The ‘why’ was there for us, when we saw such a resounding demand,” says Hammock. “It's huge.”"", 'Paige McGlauflinpaige.mcglauflin@fortune.com@paidion', ""Today's edition was curated by Emma Burleigh."", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Earlier forms of the technology have been around for decades, but these next-generation algorithms can do so much more. This includes creating a variety of original content, including images, text, and audio.', 'Beyond creating new content, generative AI can summarize emails and draft potential responses, create presentations from existing data, search the internet and company databases using specific criteria, and even draft and debug computer code.', 'Microsoft co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates has said, ""The development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone."" That\'s a bold proclamation, but the chorus of tech aficionados that concur is growing louder.', 'While there are plenty of AI stocks poised to reap the benefits of this transition, the one with arguably the most potential upside is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).', ""Nvidia pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that rendered the lifelike images that revolutionized the video game industry. However, it was the decision to adapt that technology to other applications that was instrumental in the company's success in AI. Parallel processing, the underlying technology that made GPUs so effective, takes computationally complex jobs and breaks them into smaller bits, making them more manageable."", ""From those humble beginnings, Nvidia has adapted its technology to a long and growing list of applications, including high-performance computing, cloud computing, data centers, and AI. Each new use case expanded the company's total addressable market, which management estimated at $1 trillion early last year -- and that was before the rapid adoption of generative AI began in earnest."", ""The company's recent results help illustrate the large and growing opportunity. In Nvidia's fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29), it delivered record revenue of $18.1 billion, which surged 206%, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.71 soared 1,274%. While easy comps from the prior year skewed the overall results, the implications are clear. Lest there be any doubt, it was the company's data center segment, which includes chips used for AI processing, that did the heavy lifting -- generating record revenue of $14.5 billion, jumping 279% -- and accounting for 80% of the company's revenue."", ""Nvidia is scheduled to report the results of its fiscal fourth quarter next week, and its forecast was eye-opening. The company guided for record revenue of $20 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, up 230% year over year. Management's commentary left no doubt that it was AI driving this train."", ""As the potential use cases for AI grow, so too do the estimates of the opportunity. Conservative estimates suggest generative AI could be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Investment Management, is much more bullish, estimating the total addressable market for AI could be as high as $37 trillion by 2030. While it's difficult to pin down the exact size of the opportunity, it's sure to be substantial -- and Nvidia's processors provide the technology that makes it all possible."", 'There are other reasons to believe Nvidia stock will only go higher from here. The company controls an estimated 95% of the data center market, according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino. The data center market is expected to rise from $263 billion in 2022 to $603 billion by 2030, according to Prescient and Strategic Intelligence Market Research. As the leader in the space, Nvidia will ride that tailwind higher.', 'The company also dominates the field of machine learning -- an established branch of AI. Nvidia has a market share estimated at 95%, according to data compiled by New Street Research.', ""This helps illustrate the inexorable ties between data centers and AI -- and Nvidia is the clear choice in both. As companies continue to adopt generative AI, there's every indication that Nvidia processors will continue to be the industry standard."", ""There's the hotly contested subject of valuation to be considered. Using the most commonly employed metrics, Nvidia is selling for 96 times earnings and 40 times sales (as of this writing), which is enough to make value investors run for cover -- but other metrics tell a different story."", ""Nvidia has been generating triple-digit growth, which is expected to continue -- at least over the short term. As such, that growth must, of necessity, be factored into its valuation. Enter Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 1 -- the benchmark for an undervalued stock."", 'The digital transformation and adoption of AI show no signs of slowing and will likely accelerate from here. Given its market-leading position and surprisingly modest valuation, Nvidia offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity for investors.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Tech giants, start-ups, and governments are looking to get their hands on the most powerful chips available in the market to train AI models and deploy AI applications.', 'According to Deloitte, the market for generative AI chips could exceed $50 billion in revenue in 2024, up from almost nothing in 2022. Nvidia has been a big beneficiary of this booming demand for AI chips. Its revenue in the latest fiscal year 2024 is estimated to have increased to just over $59 billion, which would be a whopping 119% increase over the previous year.', ""What's more, Nvidia's dominant share of the AI chip market and the long-term growth opportunity illustrate why analysts are forecasting its earnings to double each year for the next five years. All this indicates that shares of Nvidia could keep heading higher following tremendous gains of 231% in the past year."", ""However, investors shouldn't miss the fact that there are other ways to capitalize on the AI chip market. While Nvidia is known for providing graphics processing units (GPUs) for training AI models, Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) also supply critical hardware and technological know-how to help accelerate AI adoption."", ""Let's look at the reasons why buying these two AI stocks instead of Nvidia could turn out to be a smart long-term move."", ""Arm Holdings stock experienced a major breakout of late following the release of the company's fiscal 2024 third-quarter earnings on Feb. 7."", ""Investors are buying Arm stock hand over fist since its latest quarterly report, and a big reason why is that Arm now joined the league of companies benefiting from the AI revolution. The British company, which doesn't manufacture any chips of its own but licenses chip architecture and designs to other chipmakers, saw a sharp jump in the number of Arm Total Access (ATA) agreements in the previous quarter thanks to AI."", ""Arm signed five ATA agreements in fiscal Q3. This took the company's total number of ATAs to 27. That's a nice jump considering that Arm reported 18 ATAs at the end of fiscal 2023 and had signed only four such agreements in the first six months of the current fiscal year. This improvement in the number of ATAs bodes well for Arm's future as it generates more revenue than other plans."", 'Jason Child, Arm\'s CFO, remarked on the latest earnings conference call, ""As with recent quarters, we expect to sign multiple new ATA deals in Q4, and demand for our latest technology remains high as customers need access to AI-capable CPUs and related technology, such as our compute subsystems.""', ""What's more, the adoption of AI led to a jump in demand for the company's latest Armv9 architecture, which it says commands double the royalty rates of the previous generation Armv8 architecture. That's not surprising as Arm designed the Armv9 architecture with an eye on improving AI processing capabilities such as voice recognition and image processing."", ""The Armv9 architecture accounted for 15% of Arm's royalty revenue in the previous quarter, which was an improvement over the architecture's 10% contribution in the previous quarter. As the demand for AI-enabled smartphones and personal computers (PCs) increases, Arm believes it could witness stronger demand for Armv9."", 'The good part is that the AI-driven interest in Arm\'s architecture and intellectual properties substantially improved its revenue pipeline. Its remaining performance obligations (RPO) stood at $2.43 billion at the end of the previous quarter, up 38% from the year-ago period. RPO refers to the amount of revenue that Arm will recognize in future periods, and this metric improved substantially last quarter as the company signed ""multiple high-value, long-term deals.""', ""This also explains why Arm's top-line growth is set to step on the gas following an estimated jump of 18% in the current fiscal year to $3.18 billion."", ""The company is also expected to deliver 41% annual earnings growth for the next five years. But don't be surprised to see Arm do better than that as more companies line up to sign long-term agreements and use its architecture to develop AI chips, which could help the company clock faster-than-expected growth in the coming years."", ""The rapid deployment of AI servers created the need for more high-bandwidth memory (HBM). That's because HBM allows for faster transfer of data compared to traditional memory chips, which makes it essential for tackling AI workloads wherein large datasets are processed in real time."", ""This explains why top chipmakers such as Nvidia are looking to get their hands on as much HBM as possible to manufacture their AI graphics cards. In December last year, Taiwan-based publication DigiTimes reported that Nvidia paid $770 million to Micron as an advance to secure the supply of the latter's latest-generation HBM."", 'Nvidia reportedly plans to deploy Micron\'s HBM3E product in its new AI chips this year. Comments from Micron\'s management on the company\'s December 2023 earnings conference call indicate something similar: ""Micron is in the final stages of qualifying our industry-leading HBM3E to be used in NVIDIA\'s next generation Grace Hopper GH200 and H200 platforms.""', 'Based on customer feedback, Micron points out that its version of HBM3E memory ""has approximately 10% better performance and about 30% lower power consumption compared to competitive offerings of HBM3E."" If that\'s indeed the case, it won\'t be surprising to see Micron cornering a nice share of the fast-growing HBM market.', ""According to market research provider Yole Group, HBM shipments could jump 147% this year, generating $14 billion in revenue. That would be a significant jump over last year's shipment growth of 93%. Even better, HBM shipments are expected to clock a compound annual growth rate of 45% through 2029, generating almost $38 billion in revenue at the end of the forecast period."", ""With Micron commanding an estimated 25% of the market for next-generation memory chips such as HBM, the company is in a nice position to take advantage of this emerging opportunity within the memory industry. Throw in the fact that Micron's top line is expected to jump 46% in the current fiscal year to $22.7 billion followed by another significant jump next year thanks to the improving memory market conditions, and investors would do well to buy it while it is still cheap."", 'Micron is trading at just 5.8 times sales, a nice discount to other AI stocks such as Nvidia that command an expensive price-to-sales ratio of 40. This makes buying Micron stock a no-brainer considering how fast it is set to grow and the lucrative AI chip opportunity it could take advantage of.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

Indeed, while the addressable market for AI-powered chips is expected to continue growing, the company's long-term outlook appears robust."", ""However, prudent investors should consider a few things before pouring into Supermicro stock on the expectation that it'll continue soaring."", ""Following an impressive earnings report in late January, Supermicro stock has been on a tear. But as I've pointed out before, there is something almost pernicious going on with Supermicro's trading activity."", ""It seems that whenever mainstream chip stocks such as Nvidia or AMD enjoy a green day in the market, Supermicro gets rewarded as a byproduct. This dynamic is a little troubling. While investors have been making money in Supermicro for the last year, it's important to zoom out and think long-term."", ""Eventually, Nvidia and other chip manufacturers contributing to the AI revolution are going to hit an inflection point. This means that sales, margin, and profit will eventually decelerate relative to current growth rates. When this occurs, some investors may begin to sell and take some gains. As such, I wouldn't be surprised to see Supermicro's price action follow a similar dynamic."", ""While I am not advocating for investors to stand by and wait for the stock to fall off a cliff, I do think investors need to have some serious understanding of Supermicro's valuation before scooping up shares."", 'At the time of this article, Supermicro has a market cap of $44 billion. With trailing-12-month revenue of $9.2 billion, this represents a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 4.6. By comparison, more mature and differentiated integrated systems designers such as Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise each trade at a P/S of roughly 0.7.', ""For the fiscal year ending June 30, Supermicro's management is calling for revenue of up to $14.7 billion. In order to achieve a valuation of $1 trillion by 2030, the company would need to grow at a compound annual growth rate in excess of 40%, assuming its current P/S multiple."", 'While a premium for Supermicro may be warranted right now given its growth rates and momentum, it is highly unlikely that the markets will apply such a high multiple in the long run. In other words, as businesses mature, valuation often rightsizes as well. If the company can sustain annual growth in the high double digits, then Supermicro stock might enjoy a continued premium. However, I see this as highly unlikely.', ""The cyclical nature of semiconductor demand, coupled with unknown macroeconomic factors in the future, could cause Supermicro's business to decelerate at some point. Moreover, given its reliance on other manufacturers, Supermicro isn't exactly insulated from any slowdowns the chip market could face.

That level of growth will also create an estimated $280 billion in new revenue opportunities from software alone.', 'Emerging new industries are exciting, but picking the long-term winners can be challenging. For all investors know, the most prolific company of the next 20 years might not even exist yet. That suggests casting a wide net could be the best investment strategy. In this case, the best approach might be to find the early winners, own their stocks, and follow how AI progresses over time.', ""After pouring through dozens of companies, these five stood out for their strong positions to lead the industry's growth. Consider buying and holding these AI stocks. They enjoy pole positions in the AI industry and could generate life-changing investment returns over the next decade and beyond."", ""Artificial intelligence (AI) might seem like it became Wall Street's hottest trend overnight. Seemingly just as quickly, graphics chip company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has taken a stranglehold on the market for chips used to power AI models (it controls as much as 90% of the market). One of its competitors, Advanced Micro Devices, estimates the AI chip market will grow to $400 billion over the next several years. Do the math, and Nvidia's companywide revenue of $45 billion over the past year looks poised to skyrocket."", ""The competition will chase Nvidia, but the company's high-performance chips, combined with its popular CUDA computing software optimized to get the most out of them, create a turnkey package the industry keeps opting for. Perhaps Nvidia's competitors weren't ready for the AI surge. Shares have gained over 230% this past year alone, but the long-term demand for AI chips seems poised to drive the stock even higher as Nvidia grows."", ""Ironically, most chip companies, including Nvidia, don't build their chips. They only design them. Chip factories, called fabs, do the building and require cutting-edge machines to make intricate patterns on silicon wafers. ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) designs and builds extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, which are used to create the most advanced chips hitting the market today."", 'Remarkably, ASML is the only company that makes this type of machine. This machine is so complex that it takes 13 shipping containers and 250 crates to ship and costs up to $400 million each. Naturally, AI and general technology will continue progressing. Breakthroughs will require increasingly better machines to make better chips. ASML should be a long-term beneficiary of the AI boom.', 'Big technology companies are spending to build advanced computer systems, but smaller enterprises want to use AI technology to help run their businesses. Because of this, Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) is seeing growth take off. The company sells custom software applications built on three proprietary platforms: Gotham, Foundry, and AIP. Specifically, AIP was designed for building and deploying AI in commercial applications.', ""Palantir gets over half its revenue from government customers, the U.S. government being its largest and oldest customer. However, the commercial segment is thriving. Palantir's enterprise customer base grew 55% year over year in the fourth quarter and 22% over the previous three months to 221. That's just a couple of hundred companies in a broader corporate landscape of millions. If companies worldwide need AI to compete, Palantir could grow for years."", ""Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), better known as Supermicro, has evolved from selling components to complete IT solutions over the decades. However, the explosion of data center demand for AI is beginning to reach Supermicro, and the business is taking off. The company's revenue growth has accelerated, and management believes its total revenue will double this fiscal year (ending over the summer)."", ""Again, its success makes sense. Companies need AI capabilities, but non-technical businesses are far better off hiring a third party like Supermicro to come in and build a system for them. The modular design makes it easier to expand the system if their computing needs grow over time. Management estimates they're growing five times faster than the broader industry, meaning customers choose them over others. It's promising for Supermicro's long-term trajectory and shareholders alike."", ""The AI hype may have begun with ChatGPT, a generative AI chatbot built by OpenAI. Tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) jumped on the opportunity and furthered its partnership with OpenAI, tying OpenAI's growth to its cloud platform, Azure. That has already bore fruit. Microsoft reported an uptick in Azure's growth in its latest quarter, noting that over half the Fortune 500 already uses Azure and OpenAI in their businesses. Azure is the world's second-leading cloud platform, only trailing Amazon's AWS."", ""But with Microsoft, you get a diversified business with revenue streams from cloud, gaming, enterprise software, and more. Its massive size and deep pockets also give it a higher floor than most stocks you'll come across. Of course, a $3.1 trillion market cap means it's probably too large to make you a millionaire alone.

GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with SO.', ""On February 15, 2024, The Travelers Companies Inc (NYSE:TRV) released its annual 10-K filing, providing a comprehensive overview of its financial performance and strategic positioning. As a leading provider of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products, TRV has demonstrated a strong financial foundation with a market capitalization of over $39 billion as of mid-2023. The company's diverse range of insurance offerings and its strategic focus on midsize businesses and personal lines, which are roughly evenly split between auto and homeowners insurance, have contributed to its robust market presence. TRV's international operations, accounting for 6% of its premiums, indicate a global footprint that complements its dominant domestic market share."", ""Financial Resilience and Diversified Offerings: TRV's financial resilience is underscored by its substantial market capitalization, which stood at approximately $39.6 billion as of June 30, 2023. This financial strength is a testament to the company's ability to withstand market fluctuations and invest in growth opportunities. Furthermore, TRV's diversified product range, spanning commercial and personal insurance lines, allows it to mitigate risks associated with specific sectors or geographies. The company's comprehensive offerings ensure a stable revenue stream and provide a competitive edge in attracting and retaining customers."", ""Established Brand and Customer Loyalty: TRV has cultivated a strong brand reputation over its long history, dating back to 1853. This legacy has fostered a loyal customer base, which is crucial in the insurance industry where trust and reliability are paramount. The company's focus on agent, broker, and policyholder relationships, coupled with its commitment to providing a positive customer experience, has solidified its position as a trusted insurance provider. TRV's brand strength is not only a competitive advantage but also a platform for cross-selling and upselling opportunities."", ""Catastrophe Exposure and Claims Volatility: The nature of TRV's property and casualty insurance operations exposes it to significant risks from catastrophic events. The 10-K filing highlights the company's vulnerability to claims arising from natural disasters, which can lead to volatility in claims expenses and impact profitability. Despite sophisticated risk management and underwriting practices, the unpredictable nature of such events remains a persistent weakness that can strain financial resources and affect long-term stability."", 'Competitive Market Pressures: TRV operates in a highly competitive insurance market, where price and service are critical differentiators. The company faces intense competition from both national and international insurers, which can pressure premium rates and underwriting standards. As competitors leverage technology and innovate their offerings, TRV must continuously adapt to maintain its market share. This competitive landscape necessitates ongoing investments in technology and service enhancements, which can strain operational budgets and margins.', ""Technological Advancements and Data Analytics: TRV's ability to keep pace with technological changes, including the use of artificial intelligence and data analytics, presents significant opportunities. By harnessing technology, the company can improve underwriting accuracy, streamline claims processing, and enhance customer interactions. Investing in digital platforms and tools can also open new distribution channels and improve operational efficiency, positioning TRV to capitalize on the evolving insurance landscape."", 'International Expansion and Market Penetration: With 6% of its premiums derived from international markets, TRV has the opportunity to expand its global footprint. The company can leverage its expertise in various insurance sectors to enter emerging markets with growing demand for insurance products. Additionally, TRV can explore strategic partnerships or acquisitions to establish a presence in new geographies, diversifying its revenue sources and reducing dependence on domestic markets.', ""Regulatory and Legislative Changes: The insurance industry is heavily regulated, and changes in laws or regulations can have a significant impact on TRV's operations. The company must navigate a complex regulatory environment, where new legislation can expand liability, affect pricing flexibility, or introduce new compliance requirements. These changes can lead to increased costs, alter competitive dynamics, and necessitate adjustments to business strategies."", ""Economic Uncertainty and Market Disruption: TRV's business is sensitive to economic conditions, and financial market disruptions or downturns can adversely affect its performance. Economic uncertainty can lead to reduced business volumes, heightened credit risks, and lower investment returns. Additionally, the company's exposure to credit and interest rate risks in its investment portfolio can result in material losses, impacting overall profitability and financial stability."", ""In conclusion, The Travelers Companies Inc (NYSE:TRV) exhibits a strong financial foundation and a well-established market presence, underpinned by a diverse range of insurance products and a legacy of customer trust. However, the company must navigate the inherent volatility of catastrophe exposure and the competitive pressures of the insurance industry. Opportunities for growth lie in technological innovation and international market expansion, while regulatory changes and economic uncertainty pose significant threats. TRV's strategic focus on leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, while capitalizing on opportunities and mitigating threats, will be critical in maintaining its competitive edge and ensuring long-term success."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Donahue', ""Thank you, Tim, and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report that Genuine Parts Company delivered on our financial commitments in 2023 and finished the year with a solid fourth quarter. Will and Bert will cover our results in more detail, but I'd like to share a few highlights. During 2023, total GPC sales topped $23 billion an increase of nearly $1 billion from the prior year and in line with our expectations. We improved our total company segment profit margins by 50 basis points to nearly double digits, and we had our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. And notably, we returned $788 million to our shareholders this year and today, we announced that our Board approved a 68th consecutive annual increase to the dividend. Our teams around the globe delivered a strong performance while remaining focused on our long-term strategic initiatives to profitably grow our business and deliver value for our customers. I want to take this opportunity to thank our more than 60,000 GPC teammates across the world for their dedication and hard work. Our fourth quarter and full year results again demonstrate the value of our complementary business mix paired with our geographic diversity. At our Investor Day back in March of 2023, we showcased our strategic initiatives and announced long-term financial targets for the first time in our history, all focused on delivering for our customers and delivering shareholder value. Clearly, this past year had its share of challenges and opportunities, but our performance in 2023 with a good start to achieve our 3-year goals highlighted by the following: our motion team completed the integration of Command Distribution Group, and we exceeded our synergy target a full year ahead of plan. As an integrated business, Motion is a clear leader in their space, providing industrial aftermarket solutions with a compelling value proposition to more than 200,000 customers around the world. In addition, during 2023, Motion continued to roll out their fulfillment center strategy, which is driving cost efficiencies, inventory productivity and improved customer service levels. During the fourth quarter, I had a chance to visit our fulfillment center in Lakeland, Florida, and I can't say enough positive things about the team and their dedication to serving our customers. We're excited about the rollout of these facilities in 2024 and 2025. Within automotive, our international automotive businesses outperformed our expectations in 2023. Our European team continues to expand their presence and gained market share through both strategic acquisitions and organic growth. In 2023, we expanded our presence in Spain, Europe's fifth largest car park with the acquisition of Gaudi, securing our position as the leader in this strategic market. And finally, the rollout of NAPA branded product in the European market has continued to surpass our expectations, a testament to the strength of the NAPA brand. In Australasia, our team is profitably growing market share with their fourth consecutive year of double-digit profit growth on top of industry-leading sales growth. Our supply chain investments in the region have improved the customer experience while driving productivity in our business. In North America, while results fell short of our expectations, we remain focused on our strategic initiatives and continue to make solid progress. We've undertaken a comprehensive review of the NAPA business to identify key issues, and we have taken action to improve the performance at NAPA. We are confident we are focused on the right initiatives to positively impact our performance in the quarters ahead. These initiatives, along with plans for long-term investments were rolled out to our field leadership teams and across our independent owner group in December. The team's competitive drive and energy were on full display, and we know that the best days for NAPA are in front of us. And finally, as part of our long-term growth strategy, our teams continue to expand our footprint through bolt-on acquisitions. During the year, our global automotive store count expanded by 173 net new stores up approximately 2% from 2022. We remain disciplined on our playbook for acquisitions and are confident in our ability to continue seamlessly integrating future businesses across all our segments and geographies to create value for our shareholders. As we look ahead to 2024, we are seeing supportive industry fundamentals in both the automotive and industrial end markets. Within our global automotive business, we continue to see an increase in miles driven and aging and complex vehicle fleet and high vehicle prices and financing costs, all supportive for the automotive aftermarket. And we remain uniquely positioned in this space with our global footprint. Within our industrial business, macro indicators like industrial production, and the Purchasing Managers Index continue to show improvement after 15 months of contraction. We stand to benefit from a highly diversified portfolio of customers and end markets and we are well positioned now and in the future to capitalize on reshoring trends. While industry fundamentals remain supportive, broader macroeconomic factors like high interest rates, and persistent inflation in everyday purchases are pressuring the consumer and businesses alike. That said, the vast majority of parts and solutions we provide across both businesses, our brake fix and nondiscretionary in nature. In our business, parts availability is paramount, and we are leveraging our enhanced data analytics and science to have the right part in the right place at the right time. As we continue to navigate the environment in 2024, it is imperative that we remain agile and move forward with a sense of urgency. Given current market conditions, we need to continuously take action to position our business for long-term success. This morning, we announced a global restructuring initiative to further simplify and streamline our business. Will and Bert will share more about the specific actions we are taking, along with the financial implications. So in closing, we are proud to have delivered on our financial commitments for 2023. We accomplished this while taking decisive actions to improve our NAPA business in the U.S. while at the same time, investing in our strategic priorities to drive profitable growth, we believe the execution of our strategic initiatives, along with our team's relentless focus on our customers, will drive value for our customers and our shareholders, both now and for years to come. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Will."", 'William P. Stengel', ""Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by adding my thanks to the global GPC team for another great year and for their ongoing dedication to serving our customers. In addition to delivering solid financial results for the year, we also made significant progress on our strategic initiatives, many of which we shared at our Investor Day last March. Globally, we align our strategic initiatives around five foundational priorities, which include talent and culture, sales effectiveness technology, supply chain and emerging technology complemented by disciplined and value-creating M&A. Our focus around these priorities drives global team alignment as we continuously improve the customer experience and deliver profitable growth. Turning to our results by business segment. During the fourth quarter, total sales for Global Industrial were $2.1 billion, an increase of 2% with comparable sales growth of 1% versus the same period last year and 18% on a 2-year basis. Average daily sales were essentially flat in October with low single-digit growth in both November and December. Motion saw mixed results across its various end markets similar to last quarter, with particular strength in iron and steel, chemicals and mining. Categories like equipment and machinery and oil and gas were underperformers relative to the fourth quarter average. Motion continues to make excellent progress with initiatives, including sales excellence, pricing, e-commerce, technology and supply chain strategies that are helping to win profitable market share and improve productivity. For the full year, Motion sales grew $414 million or 5% with comparable sales of 5% and 22% on a 2-year basis. I'd like to take a quick moment to highlight our Motion team in Asia Pacific, who delivered a fantastic year. Sales and profit were up double digits in 2023 and the team continues to outperform our expectations. Industrial segment profit in the fourth quarter was $275 million, up 19% and 12.9% sales, representing a 190 basis point increase from the same period last year. For the full year, Industrial segment profit was $1.1 billion up 24% and 12.5% of sales, representing a 200 basis point increase from the same period last year and exceeding the 2025 target that we set at our Investor Day. Bert will take you through more detail on our outlook for the Industrial segment margin but we're confident that our strategic initiatives can continue to deliver margin expansion. Throughout 2023, the profit improvement in Industrial was primarily driven by strategic pricing excellent operating discipline, the execution of our productivity initiatives and the accelerated integration of KDG. When we announced the acquisition of KDG in December of 2021 we set a target of approximately $50 million of synergies to be accomplished over a 3-year period. We're proud to say that the integration of KDG is complete, and we've realized $70 million of synergies a full year ahead of schedule. Turning to the Global Automotive segment. During the fourth quarter, our international Automotive businesses posted positive sales growth in local currency, while sales declined at U.S. Automotive. Total sales for global automotive increased approximately 1% for the quarter, with comparable store sales decreasing 3%. For the full year, total sales for the Global Automotive segment increased 4% with comparable store sales increasing 2%, in line with our guidance. The moderation in the sales benefit from inflation continues to be a factor in our year-over-year comparisons. As expected, global automotive sales inflation moderated throughout the year and ended the year in the low single-digit range compared to a high single-digit range in the fourth quarter of 2022. Global Automotive segment profit in the fourth quarter was $259 million and segment operating margin was 7.5%, down 110 basis points. In the fourth quarter, all of our international geographies delivered margin expansion although global Automotive segment margin was negatively impacted by the performance at U.S. Automotive. For the full year, Automotive segment profit decreased approximately 1% versus the same period last year and segment operating margin was 8.2%, down 50 basis points year-over-year. Now let's turn to our automotive business performance by geography. Starting in Europe, our automotive team delivered another strong quarter with total sales growth of 10% in local currency and comparable sales growth of 4%. For the year, total sales growth was 16% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 8%. We're winning profitable market share gains across our European markets due to the ongoing execution of our initiatives and strategic value-creating acquisitions. During the fourth quarter, we saw low single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our geographies. And for the year, we delivered mid-single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our markets. This was driven by continued wins with key accounts, winning higher share of wallet with existing accounts and expanding the NAPA brand, generating over $400 million in the region, which exceeds our internal target for 2023. Congratulations to the entire AAG team for another outstanding year. In the Asia Pac automotive business, sales in the fourth quarter increased 2% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 1%. This compares to strong double-digit growth in the comparable period last year. Sales for both commercial and retail were up in the fourth quarter. The team is executing well, converting the sales momentum in the quarter into strong operating margin expansion. For the year, sales increased 7% in local currency and comparable sales increased 6%. Sales for both commercial and retail were up in the year with commercial growth up mid-single digits and retail growth up high single digits. Our Asia Pacific team had another fantastic year and their fourth consecutive year of double-digit profit growth. They continue to drive market share gains, deliver strong operating leverage and strategically invest for long-term success. Congratulations again to the Asia Pacific team on another great year. In Canada, sales grew approximately 1% in local currency during the fourth quarter, with comparable sales decreasing approximately 1%. For the year, total sales grew 5% in local currency, with comparable sales increasing 4%. We're pleased with the Canadian team's growth this year and the execution of their strategic initiatives despite a softer macroeconomic backdrop and a more cautious consumer in Canada. In the U.S., automotive sales declined 5.6% during the fourth quarter, with comparable sales down 6.1%. A reminder that our comparable sales figure includes same-store sales out from our company-owned stores as well as same-store sales into our independent owned stores. In the quarter, sales to commercial customers were down low single digits, while sales to DIY customers were down mid-single digits. For commercial, NAPA Auto Care saw low single-digit growth while major accounts sales were down mid-single digits. Let me provide an update on the priority actions we're taking at NAPA that we explained on our third quarter call. We detailed three key areas to improve, including operational rigor in our stores, addressing fill rates in key product categories and working with our commercial teams to address growth opportunities in the field. First, we completed changes to certain key suppliers to improve fill rates. The changes have improved category trends in the fourth quarter, and we're encouraged by the positive momentum. Second, our in-store service levels measured by on-time delivery to customers have significantly improved as a result of increased focus on last mile operating disciplines. Lastly, our commercial efforts are ongoing and were highlighted by the appointment of Tom Skov to a newly created role of EVP sales and store operations for NAPA. Previously serving as a Division Vice President in the West. Tom has over 20 years of field sales and operations experience with NAPA. He's an automotive parts expert and has a deep understanding of our customers, field sales and store operations. We're excited for the strong leadership Tom will bring to our sales and store operations field teams. While these actions drove encouraging improvements, the fourth quarter results at NAPA still missed our expectations. As we mentioned previously, the fourth quarter and December in particular, were difficult year-over-year sales comparisons for NAPA. Our average daily sales growth for NAPA in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 10%, which included approximately 8% benefit from inflation with December 2022 sales up 13%. As expected, the benefit from inflation did not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2023. Further, December 2022 included the benefits of extreme winter weather for most of the U.S. With that context, as we look within the current fourth quarter for U.S. Automotive, the first 2 months of the quarter were in line with our outlook that we shared last quarter. December performance, however, was well below our expectations, driven by unseasonably warm weather and moderated purchases from our independent owners. We have the opportunity to be with many of our largest owners at a week-long meeting in December. It was a productive series of discussions with high energy and good engagement. The outlook for the market fundamentals remains positive. We reviewed areas of commercial focus and detailed key initiatives to deliver profitable growth together. The NAPA competitive spirit is certainly high. A theme from the owner's feedback highlighted ongoing efforts to manage their purchases as they balance operating costs in the current environment. Based on the session's feedback, however, we remain optimistic that owners purchasing behaviors return to more normal patterns in 2024, and we're encouraged by the performance in January, albeit it's only 1 month. As we reflect on 2023 and move forward, we will continue to evolve our operating model at U.S. Automotive. We will be more intentional about owning more stores. A higher mix of company-owned stores in targeted priority markets enables us to service our repair shop and commercial customers more consistently and completely. We are also working actively to better align incentives with our independent owners to partner and grow together. We have current and future opportunities to create value in both our owned and independent owned locations. As an example, during the fourth quarter, we made strategic acquisitions of 33 NAPA stores from our independent owners, ending the year with approximately 1,560 company-owned stores up 20% versus 2021. While owner acquisitions have been a long-standing aspect of the business, these trends accelerated in the fourth quarter and second half of 2023. And we would expect these accelerated trends to continue into 2024. The NAPA business navigated unexpected challenges in 2023 but the team adjusted and took decisive action to step up our operational intensity, simplify our priorities and improve service to our customers. As we look back during the year, a few highlights. We brought in new leadership with Randy Breaux now leading the team and a proven internal leader as the new CFO. These seasoned executives got to work quickly identifying opportunities and improved our business clarity and priorities. We quickly assessed costs and took action to increase productivity and efficiency. We partnered with new suppliers to address poor fill rates in select key categories and surgically invested in inventory breadth and depth. We identified opportunities within our stores and DCs to improve our processes to ensure that we're delivering our customer commitments and executing locally. We accelerated progress on foundational talent, technology and supply chain investments, including as one example, a strategic global partnership with Google for analytics and search. And we're encouraged by some recent wins, including a structured inside sales program, planned introduction of new product lines and recent traction with loyalty programs with key customers. In 2024, we believe that supportive industry fundamentals combined with clear priorities and urgent action position NAPA to deliver success. For GPC, overall, our global teams are already actively executing 2024 priorities, focused on our key strategic initiatives across our businesses. We know evolving market environments require us to continuously evolve with them. And to that end, as Paul mentioned, we announced a coordinated restructuring program across each of our global geographies. The primary objective of the global program is to continue to simplify and streamline our operations, consistent with our overall business strategy. When we simplify, we increase the speed of local service deliver operational productivity, improve the efficiency of our teams and reduce our overall cost to serve. This program is a similar playbook to our previous GPC program implemented in fall 2019 that delivered positive results. Aspects of the restructuring are already in flight and some will take place in the months ahead. Bert will go over the financial details of our restructuring in his remarks and update you on how it's reflected in our 2024 outlook. In closing, GPC delivered solid fourth quarter and full year results, and we achieved the plan we laid out for 2023. This was driven by the benefit of our strategic business mix and global geographic diversification. Most importantly, it was driven by incredible effort from our global teammates to take care of our customers, live our GPC values every day and deliver performance. We're committed to our plans for long-term growth, and we're confident our teams are focused on the right strategic initiatives that will deliver solutions for our customers and create value. Thank you again to the entire GPC team for another great year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert."", 'Herbert C. Nappier', ""Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our performance in the fourth quarter and full year continues to demonstrate our long history of delivering earnings and cash flow growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our results, which include double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter and for 2023 were achieved while navigating through a dynamic and challenging year. Before I walk you through the key highlights of our fourth quarter and full year performance, I would like to note that we had no nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter and 12 months of 2023. Our comparisons to prior year, however, exclude nonrecurring items in 2022, primarily related to the integration of KDG and an adjustment in the fourth quarter related to a remeasurement of our product liability reserve. As we look at 2023, sales totaled $23.1 billion, up 4.5% from 2022 and consistent with our guidance. In the fourth quarter, sales increased 1.1% and with a 2% contribution from acquisitions and a 0.3% favorable impact of foreign currency and other. These items were partially offset by a 1.2% decrease in comparable sales. During the quarter, we experienced low single-digit levels of inflation in both our automotive and industrial segments in line with our expectations. As Will outlined, our fourth quarter sales performance was highlighted by the growth in Europe, Australasia and industrial, offset by the decline in U.S. Automotive. During the fourth quarter, our gross margin expanded by approximately 70 basis points. And for the year, our gross margin was 35.9%, an 80 basis point improvement from our adjusted gross margin in 2022. Our gross margin expansion was primarily driven by the execution of our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives through investments in technology that enabled us to leverage data and analytics to ensure we have the right inventory for our customers to meet their needs. Total operating and nonoperating expenses were 28.9% of sales in the fourth quarter, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from total adjusted expenses in the prior year. For the year, total expenses were 28.4% of sales, a 50 basis point increase from adjusted expenses in 2022. During 2023, we anticipated 60 basis points of deleverage related to our planned investments in team members and increased spending in technology, both of which came in line with our expectations. These investments were partially offset by cost actions throughout the year, particularly at U.S. Automotive. Despite the deleverage in SG&A, our fourth quarter gross margin expansion drove segment profit margin up 10 basis points to 9.6%. For the year, segment profit margin was 9.9%, a notable 50 basis point increase from 2022 and highlighted by our team at Motion driving an impressive 200 basis points of margin expansion on mid-single-digit sales growth with industrial now representing approximately 50% of GPC's profit pool. Our fourth quarter earnings were $2.26 per diluted share compared to $2.05 per adjusted diluted share in the same period last year, an increase of 10.2%. For the full year, earnings were $9.33 per diluted share compared to $8.34 per adjusted diluted share in 2022, an increase of 11.9%. Turning to our cash flows. For the year, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations and over $900 million in free cash flow, both in line with our guidance. During the quarter, we issued $800 million of senior unsecured notes and used $250 million of the proceeds to repay debt that matured in December 2023. We closed the year with $2.6 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.8x, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. Our capital expenditures in 2023, which totaled approximately $500 million or 2.2% of revenue, we're focused on driving the strategic initiatives we showcased at our March 2023 Investor Day. For 2023, 60% of our CapEx was growth capital, centered on technology and supply chain capabilities, including projects related to distribution center expansion and modernization, fulfillment centers at Motion and using technology to enhance our catalog and payment platforms. While modestly above our original expectations, the areas where we are investing are delivering good returns well above our cost of capital. We continue to make progress on the M&A front in 2023, a long-standing aspect of our growth strategy. During the year, we completed approximately 90 transactions, investing $309 million, with virtually all of these transactions in the Automotive segment. The blended EBITDA rate of the businesses acquired was over 9% on a pre-synergy basis and is accretive to our overall Automotive segment margin, demonstrating the discipline we have in the space. In 2023, we returned approximately $788 million or 55% of our operating cash flows to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $527 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $261 million in cash used to repurchase 1.8 million shares. Before we turn to our outlook for 2024, as you heard earlier from Paul and Will, this morning, we announced a global restructuring designed to reduce our SG&A costs, improve efficiency and accelerate investments. In 2024, we expect to incur costs of approximately $100 million to $200 million related to our restructuring efforts, and we will report this as a nonrecurring expense. Through these efforts, we anticipate a benefit of $20 million to $40 million in 2024 and $45 million to $90 million on an annualized basis. Our current restructuring activities reflect our discipline to continuously refine and improve our business and ensure we are taking the necessary actions to position us to achieve our long-term targets. As we turn to 2024, we are balancing solid industry fundamentals, which remain supportive for long-term growth across our businesses against a backdrop of mixed economic conditions, driven by high interest rates and persistent cost inflation. Despite this, we remain confident in the execution of our strategic initiatives and the benefits we expect to realize. For the year, we expect total sales growth to be in a range of 3% to 5%. We anticipate a more moderated first half and stronger second half in 2024 for both automotive and industrial. Included in our outlook is the assumption that the benefit from inflation remains at more normalized levels contributing less than 1% for both business segments. We are targeting full year gross margin expansion of approximately 20 to 40 basis points, primarily driven by our continued focus on our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. Our outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 20 and 30 basis points from further investments in technology. Our technology investments are key to enabling our strategic initiatives. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.95 to $9.15 and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.70 to $9.90, which represents an increase of 4% to 6% to last year. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance includes approximately $0.10 of EPS benefit related to our restructuring initiatives, which represents about half of the savings we are targeting for 2024. The successful execution of all our restructuring initiatives in 2024 provides an additional $0.05 to $0.10 EPS benefit, not included in our guidance. By business segment, we are guiding to the following: 2% to 4% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, with comparable sales growth in the 1% to 3% range. As we consider our sales guidance for automotive, our growth rate will be negatively impacted in 2024, by approximately 100 basis points from new incentive programs associated with changes to certain supplier arrangements we previously announced in the U.S. Automotive business. Historically, these programs have been managed by our suppliers. Under the new arrangements, these will be managed by our U.S. automotive team. The new arrangements will be accounted for as a reduction of revenue, however, have a corresponding reduction of cost of goods sold and as a result, have no negative impact to gross profit. For Global Automotive segment margin, we expect 20 to 40 basis points of expansion year-over-year. For the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of 3% to 5% and with comparable sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. For 2024, we anticipate Global Industrial segment margin to expand by approximately 10 to 20 basis points year-over-year after finishing 2023 at 12.5%. Our performance in 2023 exceeded our long-term target of 12%, driven in part by our outstanding work to integrate KDG a year ahead of schedule. We will revisit our long-term target for Industrial in the future, but we see further opportunities for margin expansion in 2024 and beyond. And finally, we are targeting corporate expense to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of sales. Turning to a few other items of interest. With our strong balance sheet and cash flows, we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that fit with our long-term growth strategies regardless of the economic backdrop. In 2024, we will continue our long history of balanced capital allocation with four priorities: capital expenditures, M&A, our dividend and share repurchases. During the fourth quarter, we added a new capability and further flexibility to pursue strategic investments with our commercial paper program launched in December. Our cash flows will remain strong in 2024 as we expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion with free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. As we outlined at Investor Day, investments in our supply chain and IT capabilities are central to our success. For 2024, we expect CapEx to be approximately $500 million or 2% of revenue, consistent with 2023. As we look at 2024, the growth capital we are deploying, which is approximately 55% of our forecast will drive modernization of our supply chain through automation and new DCs and fulfillment locations that are partnered with technology that enhances our customer experience like our investments in catalog and search platforms through our partnership with Google. As we look at M&A, our global pipeline remains robust and we continue to remain disciplined pursuing opportunities that create value. Our strong track record of success, combined with our ability to put our balance sheet to work positions us well to further grow our global scale and footprint. In maintaining our focus on shareholder returns, this morning, our Board approved a $4 per share annual dividend for 2024, representing our 68th consecutive increase to our annual dividend. This represents a 5.3% increase from the $3.80 per share paid in 2023. In closing, our teams managed the business through a dynamic environment in 2023. And including navigating unexpected pressures in our U.S. automotive business, while achieving mid-single-digit sales growth, gross margin expansion, segment margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. As we look ahead to 2024, we will continue to strategically invest in our business for the long term while taking actions to better align our assets in the near term and maintain our strong balance sheet. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.', 'Christopher Michael Horvers', 'So my first question is regarding the independent versus the company-operated stores. Can you talk at a high level what the comp look like between those two segments? And more importantly, do you have a sense of what POS is versus inventory at those independents. Presumably the deferral can only last so long. And would you expect that catch-up to happen relatively quickly?', 'William P. Stengel', ""Chris, thanks for the question. I'll take your first part there to start. The independent owners and company-owned stores for NAPA through the quarter were relatively similar with the exception of December, where we saw a tail off as we noted in our prepared remarks, from the independent owner purchases. So I would say largely similar through the quarter with the exception of December. On the inventory levels and purchasing relative to sales out we did see a positive inflection as we went through the quarter towards the end of the year. And so we are encouraged that as we come into 2024, those inventory levels will better reflect the sales out activity."", 'Christopher Michael Horvers', ""Got it. And then I guess as a follow-up and thinking about that, there was bad weather in December, good weather in January. So and you had the destock, restock. So I guess in light of that, can you talk about how you're thinking about the trend of the business? What's January? Should we look at those two months together? And how does that inform the cadence of U.S. NAPA over the year?"", 'Herbert C. Nappier', ""Chris, it's Bert. I'll take that one a little bit and maybe pull it up first before I talk specifically about January and getting into '24. But in terms of guidance, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're looking for $970 to $990 for the full year, 5% at the midpoint. Just to give you a little bit more color, we think the first half is a bit more moderated on both segments than the second half. Second half, we think will be a bit stronger. And that's really around how we're thinking about the interest rate environment, perhaps what could happen there in the second half and rebounding and improving industrial activity in the second half as well for the Motion business. Beyond that, you know the macro environment is pretty choppy. We've got high interest rates, stubborn inflation. We've got a lot of geopolitical considerations we're looking at, including an election here in the U.S. On the other side, we've got some of our own headwinds with some interest rate expense headwind for the year, and we'll be normalizing, as I said in my prepared remarks on inflation benefits against '23 and looking at the cadence of the quarters, I don't want to give quarterly guidance. But as I just talked about, moderated first half, stronger second half and a few things specifically for Q1, we'll have some interest rate headwind -- interest expense headwind, excuse me, and a difficult comp promotion, they comped at 12% last year. Still strong industrial production Q1 of 2023. We'll come up against that here in the first quarter of '24. And for the NAPA U.S. auto business, we'll be looking at a comp against some high single-digit inflation from Q1 a year ago. Taking all that together, a long answer here, but taking all that together, we do expect the NAPA business to improve sequentially from Q4 on a reported basis even with that headwind from inflation. And we're encouraged, as Will said, with what's happening in January. We really feel like we're off to a good start, met our expectations for what we were looking for in January. But as you also look at the cadence of the year, I still expect Q1 to be our weakest earnings quarter of 2024, but remain very confident in our full year guidance."", 'Christopher Michael Horvers', 'And just a finer point on that, would you expect both Motion and Industrial and U.S. NAPA to be negative in 1Q on an organic comp basis?', 'Herbert C. Nappier', ""Well, look, I don't want to get into giving you intra-quarter guidance since I'm not going to give you the quarterly guidance. I'll just kind of stick with where we are, not focus on one month since one month doesn't make a quarter but we're encouraged by January, particularly in the NAPA business, it improved sequentially from December and better expectations to start the quarter."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Scott Ciccarelli with Truist.', 'Unidentified Participant', ""This is [Josh Hong] on for Scott. So if we look at the performance of the U.S. auto business, why do you guys think you're losing so much share there? And what do you need to do to gain back share given that it's typically pretty difficult to drive meaningful share shifts in this industry?"", 'William P. Stengel', ""Yes. Thanks for the question. Listen, I think we've shared both last quarter and this quarter, a lot of specificity about the work that we're doing, proud of the progress that we're making. The script laid out a lot of the actions that we've taken specifically around operational intensity, inventory technology investments, field leadership, store operations, a big body of work, and we're highly confident that the team is going to turn it around as we move forward. So there's a lot to like -- we know we've got opportunities to get better, and we've got a lot of confidence in the team."", 'Paul D. Donahue', ""Josh, I would just tag on to what Will said. We -- look, we own our results for '23. We've touched on that. It's now behind us. We've got new leadership at NAPA. We've got an improved supply chain -- we've got improved search capabilities, new sales structure in the field, and we're confident that business, as I think I said in my prepared remarks, our best days are in front of us. So we're encouraged, as Bert said, by the early days and early weeks of 2024. And again, looking for better days ahead."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then just one on margin. So if we think about the targets you outlined last year, obviously, you're running above that on industrial and you're talking about expansion for next year. But given what we've seen in auto for '23, how are you thinking about the target you laid out there?"", 'Paul D. Donahue', ""Yes. On the Automotive segment margin, we're guiding to 20 to 40 basis points of improvement for the coming year. But we're building off of a continued strength in Europe and Australasia. We've got great businesses there with great share, and good growth opportunities. And as Will outlined, we're optimistic about where both of those businesses are headed. When we turn back to the U.S., we've got a lot of actions in flight, and we're bullish on the things that are happening Will outlined all of those, but I don't want to be repetitive. But January is off to a good start for NAPA. We're encouraged by the result there. And we think that business improves, as I said, as we move throughout 2024. I would couple that with our restructuring, our restructuring activities that we announced this morning are intended to streamline the business and improve our efficiency, and we expect to get good benefits there as well."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS Securities.', 'Michael Lasser', ""On the Industrial segment, where do you think margins can go now that you've experienced such significant growth over the last few years? And is there any reason to believe that you should give some of the growth back in the coming years?"", 'Herbert C. Nappier', ""Thanks, Michael. Look, we guided to 10 to 20 basis points of margin expansion for industrial in 2024 coming off of 12.5% in 2023 and 200 basis points of improvement this past year. I would just say the last 2 years have just delivered exceptional margin expansion for that business. We had good industrial production over that period. And most importantly, we had an outstanding execution of the integration of KDG. We got that a year earlier than we expected and at a higher level of synergy than we expected. So that helped the result in 2023. I'll be a little bit outsized, which is probably what's a normal run rate for the business. As we look at 2024, we'll operate in a little tighter economic environment. We'll have a little less top line in the first half than we did a year ago in the first half. And we're also going to be lapping those same KDG benefits that I just mentioned a moment ago. So 2024, we see a little bit of a recalibration for industrial back to what would be more historical for KDG in terms of growth, always committing to that 10 to 20 basis points of improvement. But having said all that, we see a long runway here. The industrial business is something we love. That team is just executing at a very high level. Will mentioned their operating discipline. They're focused on gross margin and we expect that to continue, which is why we've guided to more improvement this year, and we'll see that as we move into 2024 and beyond."", 'Paul D. Donahue', ""And Michael, I would just tag on to what Bert said, we've been able to accomplish this while in the midst of the longest contraction on the PMI numbers, I think, since about '08. So we fully expect -- well, we're encouraged by the move in the right direction in the PMI numbers, we'll see industrial production, I think, today comes out. But we're expecting that manufacturing to shift back to a positive -- in sometime in 2024. And that's just going to benefit the top line, which will benefit the overall business."", 'Michael Lasser', ""Got you. My follow-up question is on North American auto business. What if you assume for market growth for 2024 within that segment, just so we can get a sense for how you're assuming your market share will trend in the year ahead? And have you made any assumptions around acquisitions within your growth expectations for this year?"", 'Herbert C. Nappier', ""Yes, Michael, it's Bert. So we gave comp sales guidance for Global Automotive segment of 2% to 4%. I don't want to get into too much geographic difference. But we'll say that the market, when you take all of our geographies together, is somewhere between flat to 2% up. We've already talked about inflation, that will be about 1 point or so. And we're assuming that we'll get 1 point or so from acquisitions as we look at the automotive segment when we move through 2024. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the breakdown of how we're thinking about sales growth."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.', 'Bret David Jordan', ""Could you talk a bit more about the strategy of expanding the NAPA company-owned store base? I mean it sounds like you've added reasonably substantially to that. And are there either sort of a profile of the target acquisition by market or size? And sort of how do we think about that from a CapEx and margin impact going forward?"", 'William P. Stengel', ""Yes. I'll take the first part, and then I'll pass it to Bert. Look, I think in 2023, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we reflected deeply on where we've got opportunities in the NAPA business here in the U.S. And part of that reflection was the strategic impact of owning more stores relative to independent owners. And that was accelerated as we talked about, based on some of the feedback that we heard from owners as they work through this kind of higher cost inflation and higher interest rate environment. And that led us to be very specific and strategic about market prioritization categorizing specific markets into different categories and then thinking about our operating model through that prism. And so the benefits of that, obviously, is takes some variation out of our network. It simplifies our network when we invest in initiatives, the execution of those initiatives become easier throughout the network. And so I think there's a lot of qualitative and quantitative benefits that come from an evolution. The evolution will take time, obviously, but we think it's the right thing for us to do as we move forward. The good news, Bret, is that even when we look within our independent owner network and our company-owned network we've got great operations out there for us to replicate. And so while we will evolve over time, the value creation and operational opportunity in front of us is to get on both sides of the house, the underperforming stores up to best-in-class. And so that's a very actionable body of work. As it relates to capital allocation, I'll ask Bert to make a few comments."", 'Herbert C. Nappier', ""Look, on the capital allocation side, this will show up as M&A. These are small acquisitions. And so that won't really be a CapEx number, but more of an M&A number. And look, they're very attractive to us. We have got a great balance sheet a lot of financial strength and flexibility to be able to lean in here and we'll have the ability to do that. These are attractive in terms of being accretive almost immediately as we recapture some of the margin we were sharing previously with an independent owner. We get to reduce some of the structural costs and the way we serve our customers. We'll capture some SG&A synergies, particularly on the IT side and with some of the team members and the overhead and back office ranks. And we'll drive some incremental sales, as Will mentioned. We really have an ability to partner our commercial activities where also with an independent owner, they may not be fully NAPA sourced, we'll be able to increase that as well. These are asset deals and always and generally in high-performing markets. So we like the lean here, and we think there's a lot to love."", 'Bret David Jordan', 'Great. And then you commented that December, in particular, you saw independent volumes down or purchasing down. Is there anything -- was that a weather impact? Was that a sort of compounding effect of high rates on their cost of carrying inventory, sort of what do you attribute that air pocket and the independence too?', 'William P. Stengel', ""Bret, I think you nailed it. I think it was a cumulative effect of both of those cumulative effect of rates through the year, getting to year-end, closing the books, if you will, softer weather and then just getting ready for maybe a more robust 2024. So as we said in our comments, we're encouraged by the first 3 or 4 weeks of the year here, and hoping for a more normal 2024 as we move forward."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore.', 'Gregory Scott Melich', ""I'd like to circle back on the restructuring activity. So Bert, could you help us understand the $100 million to $200 million? Is it cash, noncash? What's the portion there? And in terms of the synergies, what segments do they show up? Where will we see that in the P&L over time?"", 'Herbert C. Nappier', ""I'll start maybe with the second part of that. So in terms of where will they show up in the P&L, this is a global restructuring. So we'll have all the business units participating. In terms of breakdown of where you'll see things -- the biggest part of our SG&A cost is people cost. And so you'll see the vast majority of the benefit. About 2/3 of the benefit we expect to get, will come out of the people side. It will be about half of the cost. It starts already. So we've announced last week, a voluntary retirement program here in the U.S. That is the preponderance of the activity, and you'll see that show up in our U.S. business results as we move forward. The offer period for that closes here in the first quarter. So we won't expect any Q1 benefits of that, but you'll see those build as we get through the second half or last three quarters of the year. In terms of cash, noncash, I would say it's predominantly cash. We do have DC and facility consolidation. Some of that will be a noncash charge. But I would say at this point, particularly with the voluntary retirement offer in the U.S., it's predominantly cash. And then we both report it all at the nonrecurring expense as we move forward and call that out for you guys."", 'Gregory Scott Melich', ""Got it. I appreciate that. And I guess, back on the business, could you just level set us now I know we're up to the 1,500 stores that are company owned. Could you level set us on what isn't company-owned, Well, how many independents there are, what's company-owned and then also the mix of business that's NAPA AutoCare major accounts and then up and down the street."", 'William P. Stengel', ""Yes. So today, Greg, for the NAPA business here in the U.S., it's about 25%, 30% company-owned and the balance independent owned. We have over 2,000 independent owners roughly. So that gives you some perspective. In total, we've got 6,000 stores in the U.S. So that gives you all the math there. As you look around the world, we have the independent owner model in Europe, obviously, it's about 1/3, 2/3 company-owned to independent own and about that same ratio in our Canadian business. And then we're a 100% company owned in our Asia Pac business."", 'Paul D. Donahue', ""Greg, this is Paul. I'll jump in on the second part of your question regarding the business breakdown, major accounts roughly in the high teens, 20% range. NAPA AutoCare, which we're incredibly excited about the progress we're seeing in NAPA AutoCare. We've had a big surge in memberships over the last 90 days. That's about 20% of our overall commercial business. You mentioned small kind of mom and pop up and down the street. We've got a program as well in place where we're focusing in on getting back some of that business. That's about 20% roughly. And then you've got government and fleet, which for us, Greg, that's a significant part of our commercial business and one that -- we have long been incredibly strong and that's about the balance of your 40% of your commercial business. So I hope that helps."", 'Gregory Scott Melich', 'It does.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush.', 'Seth Mckain Basham', 'My question is on sell-in versus sell-through to independents in 2024. So as we sit here today, are you anticipating your guidance, those to be pretty equivalent?', 'Herbert C. Nappier', ""Seth, I'm not sure I fully follow that. Run that by one more time."", 'Scot Ciccarelli', 'Sell-in versus sell-out for your independents. How they finished destocking from your perspective so that we should see more pressure on comps from that effect?', 'William P. Stengel', ""Yes, I think we're expecting 2024 to be a more normal year coming off of 2023, which was clearly challenged and different than our expectations."", 'Seth Mckain Basham', ""Got it. And then my follow-up is, Paul, you talked about the up and down the street customers. Perhaps that's one area where you've seen some of the most pressure on your business. Are there competitive dynamics there that you didn't anticipate? And what are your plans for getting back to that business specifically?"", 'Paul D. Donahue', ""So I think Will mentioned, Seth, in his prepared remarks, he made some comments about our sales force restructuring more of -- and also taking an opportunity to learn a bit from our industrial team with an inside sales group that is focused on that type customer. There's nothing new on the competitor said, look, Seth, we've got great competitors, and they're tough and they ultimately raise the bar on us and make us better. And that's exactly how we're responding. So we think there's an opportunity to go back and capture some of that business, and we've got programs, incentives and people in place to make that happen. So again, encouraged 6 weeks into the year, early days, but we are encouraged with what we're seeing."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens.', 'Daniel Robert Imbro', 'One on the industrial side. I did get disconnected during Q&A, so apologies if you said this but obviously, industrial growth continued to outperform, I think, the broader market. I guess, what end markets are showing the most relative strength? And is that just share gains? And then when we look at the monthly cadence, this low single digit, is that the right exit rate as we think about 1Q and organic growth in the industrial side?', 'William P. Stengel', ""Daniel, I'll take the first part of your question. I think previously, we've shared some commentary with you on the end markets that we track here internally. There are about 14 of them. And as I said in my prepared remarks, it's similar to Q3, it's a mixed mosaic as it relates to kind of growth versus contraction. Having said that, just maybe a few additional data points. As we look at the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter across those 14 in the fourth quarter, we had 9 of 14 in growth mode, which is an increase of 2 versus the prior quarter. And if you decomp that growth, we've got low single digits in 3 of them, mid-single digits and 2 of them high single digits in 1 of them and double-digit growth in 3 of them. So on balance, we're encouraged by the sequential improvement versus third quarter and even in the 5 of 14 that are declining, we saw 3 of those 5 improve in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of perspective of, call it, the last 6 months' trends on all things end markets."", 'Paul D. Donahue', ""And then, Daniel, you asked about Q1. As you know, we don't give out quarterly guidance. What I would tell you, Q1 will be our toughest comp of the year, Daniel. And I think as Bert mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're looking for really a strong -- much stronger second half. But I will tell you this, our industrial team is focused, you hit it in your question. I do believe we're taking share. We've got the best team in the industry, and I have no doubt they'll deliver for us in Q1 as well."", 'Daniel Robert Imbro', ""Great. I appreciate that. And then for a follow-up, I wanted to follow up on the restructuring. You talked about in the previous question, maybe where we're going to see it in the reported numbers. But I'm curious if we dig into like what kind of jobs are we actually reducing across the business? And how do you weigh that against the risk of service levels? It feels like some of your auto peers are investing into stores and into distribution. And so curious how you guys think about the competitive dynamics and how you view that risk in '24 as you try to maybe gain back some of the share?"", 'Herbert C. Nappier', ""Daniel, thanks for the question. Look, I would tell you that the big construct here is to protect the field customer-facing selling organization. It's super important to how we go to market how we can stay very competitive. And so as we look at the voluntary program in the U.S., which is, as I said earlier, the substantial majority of all the activity we're taking that voluntary program is very thoughtful. It's targeted to those that are closer to retirement, which is why it's a voluntary retirement offer. And mostly focused on management and back office spans and layers. And so I would just say that we feel really good about the thoughtfulness that was put in by our teams of how to make sure that we strike the balance here between continuing to serve our customers and deliver every single day, but at the same time, do the right thing for the business for the long term and streamline some of our costs."", 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.']"

I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year financial results and our outlook for 2024. I will also share some of the significant progress we have made implementing our growth strategy. First, let's discuss our performance in the fourth quarter. We drove strong financial performance in the fourth quarter, delivering an impressive finish to our first year as a public company. Sales were $400 million compared to $385 million during the same period last year, an increase of approximately 4%. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $71 million, or 17.9% compared to $53 million, or 13.9% in the prior period."", ""Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter excludes $8 million of one-time standalone costs and $7 million for the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.49 in the fourth quarter of 2023 and adjusted free cash flow was $30 million. Adjusted free cash flow excludes $4 million of one-time capital expenditures related to separation from Cummins. As expected, we saw some continued destocking and softer freight activity, which dampened revenues from our aftermarket. This was offset by continued strong demand in U.S. first-fit markets. In India, markets remained strong and in China, we saw demand slowly recovering. Now let's review our full year results. Sales for 2023 were $1.63 billion, an increase of approximately 4% from 2022. Adjusted EBITDA margin rose 300 basis points from the prior year to 18.6%."", ""EBITDA has been adjusted for one-time separation costs which were $29 million in 2023 compared to $9 million in 2022. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.31 for the full year and adjusted free cash flow was $152 million. Free cash flow has been adjusted for $9 million of one-time capital expenditures related to our separation. Turning to our global markets now, I want to share some insight into the material drivers for our business and provide you with our guidance for 2024. Our business is diversified geographically and the length of the cycle for aftermarket and first-fit varies. In 2024, we anticipate first-fit and aftermarket will be countercyclical. Let's start with aftermarket for both on-highway and off-highway markets. As a reminder, aftermarket represents approximately 80% of our global revenues."", 'We experienced softer freight activities and destocking during the second half of 2023 in on-highway markets. In North America, which represents a significant portion of our business, we saw the cash rate index down about 9% in the second half compared to prior year and down 5.5% over the full year. We believe we are largely through the destocking and expect on-highway aftermarket to improve, as we move through 2024, driven by growth in freight activity. In global off-highway markets, we are monitoring several key industries. We expect construction in North America will be supported by resilient demands in non-residential construction, which is aided in part by government infrastructure spending. In Europe, we expect the weakness in construction activity to continue due to overall economic conditions.', 'And global mining markets are expected to be relatively flat from a robust 2023. Based on these market assumptions, we anticipate overall aftermarket for on-highway and off-highway to be flat to up 3%. Turning to our global first-fit markets, our three key geographies are the U.S., China and India. In the U.S., we anticipate heavy-duty truck will be down 10% to 15% and medium duty truck will be flat to down 5%. We expect the first half demand will remain robust before it begins to decline in the second half of 2024. The recovery in China has been sluggish and we anticipate a continued muted recovery. We expect heavy-duty and medium duty truck production to be in the range of down 5% to up 10%. China is the most difficult market for us to forecast, leading to this wide range in outlook.', 'In India, we see industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year, driven by strong on-highway performance. As a result of these market drivers and our growth plans, we anticipate total revenue to be down 1% to up 3% resulting in guidance for global sales in the range of $1.61 billion to $1.675 billion in 2024. We expect continued strong operational performance and to deliver adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.25% to 19.25%. Additionally, we anticipate adjusted EPS will be in a range of $2.10 to $2.35. Now I would like to take a moment to share the progress we have made on implementing our four pillar growth strategy. The first pillar is to grow share in first-fit. While our first-fit business represents about 20% of our overall business, it is the foundation for driving recurring revenue in our aftermarket.', 'We are a leader in fuel filtration and crankcase ventilation products and we are focused on growing this leadership transition with global OEM customers. We are winning with the winners and have continued to secure Cummins new vehicle platforms. As an independent company, we also have the ability to accelerate growth with other leading global OEMS. Additionally, we are continually investing in new product development. In 2023, we opened two new technical centers for key global markets. The first center opened in Wuhan, China, and our second is our global capability center in Pune, India. Our second pillar is to accelerate profitable growth in the aftermarket. We are transforming our global distribution capabilities to provide our customers with industry-leading product availability.', 'We established three new distribution centers in Brazil, Mexico, and Dallas, Texas, and we have also transitioned our largest distribution center in Kentucky from Cummins. We have plans in place to establish independent distribution centers in Europe and Asia-Pacific in 2024. Furthermore, we have a unique multi-channel path to diverse global markets, which includes an exclusive agreement with Cummins to distribute our products. At the same time, we are growing our distribution network and have expanded our presence in key independent channels in North America, Brazil and Mexico. This increase in channel presence will support continued growth in our aftermarket. The third pillar is transform our supply chain. We are investing in our manufacturing capacity to improve automation and provide our customers with industry-leading products.', 'We completed our fully automated green cartridge production line in France. In Korea, we are expanding our production capabilities for our NanoNet filtration media. These investments will continue to improve our operational excellence and operating costs. Our fourth pillar is to expand into industrial filtration markets. We intend to pursue this growth inorganically through a disciplined programmatic approach. Our capital allocation priorities will continue to reflect our focus to grow both organically and inorganically. In closing, I want to take the opportunity to provide you with an update on Cummins announcement to launch the share exchange. As expected, Cummins has announced they will commence an exchange offer to fully split off their remaining interest in Atmus.', 'We have filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission today, in connection with the Cummins announcement. Pursuant to the exchange offer, Cummins shareholders will have the opportunity to exchange their shares of Cummins common stock for shares of Atmus. Upon successful completion, Cummins will no longer be the controlling shareholder of Atmus. The completion of the exchange offer will be a significant milestone for Atmus, allowing us to unlock our full potential and accelerate the delivery of our growth strategy. I am proud of our Atmus team who have worked hard to deliver these results. As I reflect on 2023, we made significant progress and this fuels my belief in what is possible for Atmus as a fully independent company.', 'I am even more excited for the opportunities we have in front of us in 2024. Now I will turn the call over to Jack who will discuss our financial results in more detail.', 'Jack Kienzler: Thank you, Steph, and good morning, everybody. We delivered another strong quarter of financial performance in the fourth quarter. Sales were $400 million compared to $385 million during the same period last year, an increase of approximately 4%. The increase in sales was primarily driven by pricing and the favorable impact of currency, partially offset by a decrease in volume. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was $106 million, an increase of $23 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition to pricing, we also benefited from lower freight and commodities, which more than offset the impact of lower volumes. As a reminder, during the fourth quarter of 2022, we took action to significantly right size our inventory and experienced short-term operational inefficiencies as we slowed production.', 'These actions did not repeat in 2023. Selling, administrative and research expenses for the fourth quarter were $58 million, an increase of $6 million over the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher administrative costs related to our separation from Cummins, in addition to the impact of higher variable compensation driven by overall company performance. Joint venture income was $9 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $2 million from 2022, due to increased performance at our joint ventures in India and China. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of $71 million, or 17.9% compared to $53 million or 13.9% in the prior period. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter excludes $8 million of one-time standalone costs and excludes $7 million for the same period last year.', ""These one-time costs primarily relate to the establishment of functions previously commingled with Cummins such as information technologies, distribution centers, and human resources. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.49 in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was the same amount in the prior year. Higher interest expense incurred from debt issued at our IPO offset stronger underlying financial results. Adjusted free cash flow was $30 million this quarter compared to $63 million in the prior year. Last year, we generated significant cash flow from the reduction of our inventory as supply chains improved. Now, let's discuss our full year 2023 financial results. Sales were $1.63 billion compared to $1.56 billion in 2022, an increase of 4%. We benefited from $102 million of pricing actions which were partially offset by $34 million of lower volume and $2 million of foreign exchange headwinds."", 'Gross margin was $433 million, an increase of $74 million from 2022. In addition to favorable pricing, we saw commodities and freight improve by $41 million. This was partially offset by lower volumes and unfavorable manufacturing costs. Selling, administrative and research expenses for the full year 2023 were $217 million, an increase of $39 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by administrative costs related to the separation from Cummins and variable compensation. Variable compensation is higher this year as our employees delivered strong results relative to our plan. Our team will receive the payout of the incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2024, which will impact first quarter cash flow from operations.', 'Joint venture and other income was $37 million in 2023 compared to $32 million in the prior year, primarily due to increased performance of our India joint venture. Adjusted EBITDA was $302 million or 18.6% compared to $243 million or 15.6% in 2022. One-time costs related to separation were $29 million for the full year 2023 compared to $9 million in 2022. We believe these costs will be in a range of $5 million to $15 million in 2024 as significant progress on our separation was achieved in 2023. The effective tax rate for 2023 was 24.3% compared to 19.6% in 2022. The increase was driven by a change in the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign operations related to a legal entity restructuring implemented in anticipation of the IPO and separation.', ""For the full year 2023, adjusted EPS was $2.31 compared to $2.13 in 2022. Higher interest expense incurred from debt issued at our IPO lowered results in 2023. For the full year 2023, adjusted free cash flow was $152 million compared to $129 million in 2022. Strong profitability and a focus on working capital management generated robust cash flow, which was partially offset by increased interest expense. Now let's turn to the strength of our balance sheet at the end of 2023, we ended the year with $168 million of cash on hand, driven by strong free cash flow generation. Combined with the full availability of our $400 million revolving credit facility, we have $568 million of available liquidity. Our cash position and strong performance during 2023 has resulted in a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.4x at the end of the year."", 'Our balance sheet provides us with operational flexibility as we enter 2024 to focus on value creation and delivering total shareholder value by deploying capital for both continued organic growth and strategic inorganic initiatives. In closing, I want to thank our global team for their commitment, which allowed us to deliver exceptional results during our first calendar year as a public company. We are looking forward to continuing our momentum as we execute on our strategy in 2024. Now, we will take your questions.', 'See also 20 Most Meat Eating States Per Capita and Top 20 Defense Contractors in 2024.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

It wasn’t just the better-than-expected numbers but recent moves, including taking a $1.5 billion stake in Fortnite-maker Epic Games, that have me viewing Disney as a potential back door into the realm of the Metaverse.', 'As Disney’s top boss and CEO, Bob Iger, looks to bring the firm back to the top again, it’s hard not to be a raging bull on the stock. Combined with more activism from activist investor Nelson Peltz (he’s still pursuing board seats), looking to pressure for positive change, I couldn’t be more bullish on the stock as it looks to pivot.', 'With the stake in Epic Games, the recent sports streaming partnership with rival streamers, and news of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour coming to the Disney+ streaming platform, there hasn’t been this much to be excited about with regards to Disney in quite a while.', 'In many ways, Taylor Swift’s Eras could be the biggest non-Disney production to land on the platform since the firm brought Broadway hit sensation Hamilton just a few years ago. Though Eras could give consumers another reason to resume their Disney+ subscriptions, I view the biggest takeaway from the latest quarter (and commentary) as Disney’s ambition when it comes to the virtual realm.', 'Further, the streaming of concert tours represents a stark contrast to the content offered by other video streamers. Though concerts, plays, and recorded live experiences are fun to view through your television, I believe that they are best enjoyed in the realm of virtual reality.', 'Disney’s openness to exploring the realm of virtual reality and spatial computing is nothing new. Remember when Bob Iger was on stage during the reveal of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro? Iger saw the potential in Apple’s latest product, and his firm’s recent bets look like they’d translate into the realm of immersive worlds very nicely.', 'Disney+ has been hot on Vision Pro’s tracks since day one, even as some of its peers, most notably Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) opted not to develop a native visionOS app in these early stages for Apple’s newest product. Personally, I think Netflix has a lot to lose if it doesn’t end up creating a slew of content for the new spatial medium, as Disney has. Of course, Netflix has deep enough pockets to play catch up at a later date, perhaps when headsets become more commonplace in the household.', 'For now, though, Disney has its sights set on the future. And for that reason, I prefer Disney over the likes of Netflix. In many ways, Disney seems to be on the right track, bringing must-see “experiences” like Eras to its platform. Imagine experiencing the content on a 100-foot screen on your Vision Pro headset. Such an experience will make like you’re almost a part of the action.', 'In the future, I’d look for Disney to invest more in spatial cameras for various productions — like those on the iPhone 15 Pro line — that can deliver “spatial” experiences that take the immersive factor to the next level. In its current state, the Vision Pro seems like a risky innovation to shrug off through the eyes of a prospective content creator. However, in a few years, it could become a must-have device as more content from Disney and others lands gradually.', 'Over time, it’s certainly not hard to envision a flood of high-quality “spatial” content storming over to the Vision Pro, perhaps thanks in part to forward-thinking content creators like Disney. Apart from concerts, video games, and other experiences, Disney’s sports streaming push may be just the first step to achieving the holy grail of virtual court-side seats via spatial computers and VR headsets.', 'Indeed, ESPN has been a drag on Disney’s business for quite some time. But in the realm of spatial computing and streaming, the ESPN acquisition may finally prove its worth. Even if spatial computing takes a couple more years to take off (the form factor remains a tad too bulky), I have to say I’m impressed with where Disney is headed. It looks to be strolling right into the Metaverse. And if virtual-reality headsets end up a success, I’d argue that Disney could have what it takes to fight back at Netflix at long last.', 'On TipRanks, DIS stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 21 analyst ratings, there are 16 Buys, four Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average DIS stock price target\xa0is $115.50, implying upside potential of 2.7%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $82.00 per share to a high of $130.00 per share.', 'In many ways, Disney seems to be the ultimate metaverse content play, as it looks to become one of the bigger developers for so-called “killer” apps on the next generation of spatial computing products.', 'From sports streaming to metaverse-like video games (think Epic’s Fortnite) and recorded concert experiences, Disney seems to be rolling the dice on the Metaverse. And it certainly could win in a big way as the field evolves. Indeed, Disney and Apple seem to be forming a symbiotic relationship as both look to unlock the full power of the immersive virtual worlds of tomorrow.', 'Disclosure']"

A full transcript follows the video."", 'This video was recorded on Feb. 8, 2024.', ""Deidre Woollard: Disney waves some magic wand of savings. Motley Fool Money starts now. Welcome to Motley Fool Money, I'm Deidre Woollard here with Motley Fool Analyst Rick Munarriz. Rick, how are you doing today?"", ""Rick Munarriz: I'm doing fantastic today do you think?"", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, I'm wondering if Disney's earnings have something to do with that 'cause I consider you to be Disney-ficionado, Disney bull perhaps. Last night's earnings, it seemed to be it was definitely all over the place. But it seemed to send the message that the strategies working earnings per share were up. Company's really done so well at cutting costs, cut $500 million in SG&A expenses. They're headed toward that $7.5 billion goal. It's not the most thrilling thing we've ever heard, but how important are savings to Disney right now?"", ""Rick Munarriz: Right now, it's very important. Again this 7.5 billion, this was $5.5 billion a year ago when back in February of 2023 Bob Iger said hey, I think we can save $5.5 billion in annualized savings costs. In November, just a couple of months ago they said all right, we can actually raise this 7.5 billion. Now he's saying meet or exceed 7.5 billion that exceed word is new. The fact that savings are happening and you're saying great, what does this mean? That Disney found a few more Disney dollars under its seat cushion sofa. But what it means is Disney right now on the top line, isn't a very exciting story organically. It's had a couple of movies basically strike out at the box office. Cord cutting is hurting its legacy business. It's theme parks which have been strong, attendance has been sluggish the last couple of quarters at Disney World and Florida strong everywhere else. It's not running on all cylinders on the top line. If it can save money and improve as an earnings story which is exactly what we saw play out this quarter, I think it will continue to get investors excited the way it did this time around."", ""Deidre Woollard: It seems like investors were pretty excited about that. They were increasing the dividend. It's not where it was before they had to stop it during the pandemic, but it's up 50% from the last dividend, so that certainly seems like a good start. They announced some interesting things. Let's start with the first one, which is $1.5 billion stake in Epic Games. It seems like it's a little bit about the Fortnite brand, but it seems like it's more about bringing gaming opportunities to the Disney IP. I'm both ways about this, I see Netflix and others doing this. I know gaming is very popular. What should we be looking for here? It's probably going to take at least a year or so, I think for this to figure out if this is money well spent."", ""Rick Munarriz: It's going to take time, this isn't something that you just snap your fingers and pixie dust and everything Disney is now, you can just walk into Toy Story in the middle of a Fortnite realm. But I do think that it's a good move for Disney on the gaming end. They've always struggled when they try to do it in house. Their best successes have been when they license it out to someone. This is their partners with Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic Games they've worked with him before. This makes sense and Fortnite, who knows what'll be popularity wise a couple of years ago. It seemed to be sluggish a year or two ago, but it's had a resurgence since the end of last year, where it'll be by the time this launches. But the important thing about Fortnite to me and the whole Epic Games universe, is 85% of the gamers on Fortnite are 35 years or younger. This is a demographic that Disney needs to reach if they want new blood especially a lot of younger people that are very jaded. They're not listening to branded ads, consumers, they're not even consuming ads for the most part. This is a way to reach out to them and push out their franchises and eventually some e commerce opportunities they were talking about through this venture. I think it's a good move and again, it's hard to talk about a $1.5 billion investment when Disney's trying to save money on the other hand. But I think there are times where you do have to spend money to make money and to remain relevant, and I do like this deal."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, you've mentioned something about attracting younger viewers. Our colleague, Ricky Mulvey, made a list of some of the new things they announced and they aren't that new. I mean, everything seems to be either a sequel or an extension of existing IP, like Dead Pool 3, Inside Out 2, Moana 2, you've got a new Lion King movie. I mean, yes, you're betting on sure things, but also is there some concern that there just isn't any place new to go for this company?"", ""Rick Munarriz: I think there's a balance of everything here. Inside Out it was just a new franchise just a couple of years ago. You do have a case where franchises happen. Again, we can look at like Billy Joel putting out, writing his first song in 30 years, but people are still going to the Billy Joel concerts, still selling out Madison Square Garden. Not that Disney wants to retread everything that it's put out before, but there's familiarity. The fact that we're getting a Lion King movie, a Moana movie, a Dead Pool, Inside Out, an aliens movie, a Planet of the Apes movies, all this calendar year from Disney after they had such a terrible year last year. Makes me feel comfortable that, hey, this is going to be a good year for Disney at the local multiplex. Whereas if it was just a bunch of unproven properties, I hope some of these brand-new hits hit because a franchise always starts with that first movie. I do think that if they were relying too much on it, you get to the problem of what Disney had, where they just play it safe and that got them into trouble before. But right now, when they need hits, you're going to go to your moneymakers, and I think that's what they're doing right now."", ""Deidre Woollard: At least on the streaming side, they'll have a little extra dose of Taylor Swift. That will help as well because they announced the Eras movie with additional content, so they'll get this."", ""Rick Munarriz: March 15, every Tate fan out there already has that date circled ready. Whatever era is, they prefer Taylor's version ready to go?"", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, let's switch from Taylor to sports. Let's talk a little bit about ESPN."", ""Rick Munarriz: Isn't Taylor sports anyway? These days she's always at a."", ""Deidre Woollard: Of course she is. It is The Taylor Bowl this year. Let's talk a little bit about ESPN. I mean, I've been watching what they've been doing with ESPN for a while and they keep talking about what they were going to do next and not really delivering. Now it seems like we've got some real concrete plans. You've got two things happening. The first is came out the day before earnings, they announced with the ESPN Linear Network. That's going to be in what they call the Skinny Sports bundle with Warner Bros Discovery Fox. Then there's also going to be the direct to consumer ESPN streaming service that comes out in the fall of 2025. What fascinated me about this was the sports bundle, the Wall Street Journal called it a blind side to the sports leagues. Does this change the game for them?"", ""Rick Munarriz: Not that it changes the game, but it makes sure that they're the ones running the ball. Just as ESPN has been the dominant sports leader. This is a company I given said CNBC right before the earnings squall right after the report, he's saying, hey, I'd rather be a disruptor than being disrupted. He's known for years that cord cutting is basically eating away at the legacy, carrier rights that they have through the cable networks and the satellite television. He doesn't want to turn their backs on them. He struck deals with them to try to, keep them afloat. But he knows that the real money has to come from the streaming side. It's better for someone else to get together with two of its biggest rivals in sports content to create that skinny bundle or to go directly over the top and reach consumers directly the way it is with the ESPN and the larger ESPN offering that's coming out next year, in the fall of next year. I do think that it's the right move and I don't think the leagues will be too upset. There are people upset that the watch a playoff game on Peacock, this NFL season, so it's better to have just the network that everybody knows is the one that do it, rather than go, oh, it's Thursday? Do I need to fire up Amazon Prime this time? Do I need to have YouTube TV to catch the NFL Sunday ticket? There's a lot of weird choices people have to make. ESPN is like the default setting, so I think anything they do is a good thing."", ""Deidre Woollard: I've experienced that myself in trying to figure out where something I want to watch actually is located. The other thing I find interesting about this is the ESPN solo thing, because you mentioned that CNBC interview with Bob. I listened to that too, and you described that experience as more immersive with shopping and with betting. It didn't come up on the earnings call, but I'm very curious about their sports betting business. Their collaboration with Penn seems like it's certainly being promoted a lot. But is it going to be a while before we actually, hear how it's doing and it ends up in the reporting?"", ""Rick Munarriz: I think Disney they've always tiptoed around the gambling aspect of it if you go on a Disney cruise ship. Again, I haven't been on it in a couple of years, but every time, that's the one cruise line where I know I'm not going to go to a casino because they don't have them. At least they didn't have them a couple years ago. They've been very careful about this, so obviously they weren't just going to launch their own online sports book. They, start to deal with Penn for ESPN bet. It's been out for a couple months now. It makes sense that if you're going to be doing it a point now, everybody, everything's fund this drafting this, it's MGM bet this. The sports books are everywhere, they're commonplace. It will become acceptable for Disney possibly to do it on its own eventually. But right now, I think it makes sense if you're putting out this bundled package of sports programming, you may as well realize that I'm reaching fans, fantasy sports fans of actual wagering on games. Why am I not cashing in on this when they are basically in the driver's seat."", ""Deidre Woollard: If it's a stand-alone streaming thing, is there a point where you're betting with your remote? It sounded like that was what Iger was hinting at."", ""Rick Munarriz: Yeah, and it was. Fubo TV to bring out a company that basically, hates this news because they thought they had this market cornered and they basically, got crushed the Brother and the Fox and the Disney ESPN Collection they hate that. But you could have actually used your remote. They were trying to set it out before they pulled out of the online sportsbook market, where you can use your remote or an app tied to what you're watching. Real time, it follows you so it knows what you're watching. You get real time bets on your phone. Who knows what the future will be. Hopefully, again, and gambling is an addiction. Hopefully it's done in a way that doesn't, destroy us all. But clearly, it's a money making opportunity for Disney."", ""Deidre Woollard: Definitely. Well, speaking of money making a little bit, you mentioned earlier the parks in experience business, it's great globally, you mentioned that weakness domestically. Some of that, they're coming off the 50th anniversary celebrations. There's a lot of media out there about it's too expensive. A lot of families complaining. You're in Florida, what have you seen?"", ""Rick Munarriz: It is expensive every year, and it's not just Disney World, the rivals too. One of them raises prices, the other one's going to raise prices, if annual passes get more expensive, sometimes Disney even stop selling annual passes. They do that in Disneyland, and they even did it for a little while at Disney World that they're saying, there's just too many people in the parks. Now it's the opposite where they want more people in the parks, they're putting more promotional aspects to it but I think there's a lot of factors into it but, again, Disneyland is doing fine. They opened a year later, about technically nine months after Disney World. Disney World opened in July 2020, Disneyland in April 2021 so the whole travel revenge travel phase played out earlier in Florida than it did out in California but you do have a case where they had that 100th celebration. Disney World opened a couple of really big rides, two very game changing roller coasters, and two of its steam parks, but that ended. That was back in March and since then things have been pretty sluggish. I do think that it's a matter of everything settling and the economy settling and saying, we're comfortable again to start traveling again. By no means is Disney World, this vast Tumbleweed Wasteland. It is very crowded, especially during the holidays but I do think that it could definitely use a little love right now. It is a little expensive. That comes with the territory but even though they've had like attendance, maybe the same that it was in 2019, they're generating 40% revenue per capital, higher than they did in 2019. People are paying more, there's premium experiences you can buy to get into the fast pass lane, the old fast lane which is lightning lane now. They do have things to take more money out of you, extract more money out of you, which is what all the other theme park operators do. Disney was just the last one to hop onto that bandwidth."", ""Deidre Woollard: From fast to lightning. They're spending more money on the parks themselves. It sounds like they are doing some investing there. Even as they're trying to save money, they're still investing in the parks."", ""Rick Munarriz: Yeah. I was at Disneyland two weeks ago so I covered both coasts just in this past couple of weeks. Next week I will be at Disney World, so I'm there often. There's a lot of construction activity happening in both parks, both resorts. But Disney said just a couple of months ago that they're going to spend $60 billion in the next decade in capital expenditures for their theme parks and experiences. This includes their cruise ships where they keep expanding their fleet but mostly going into their theme parks and we're seeing that a lot of upgrades are happening. We just had some big upgrades in Asia for the two parks two resorts over there and you're going to see this happen in the US in the next couple of years."", ""Deidre Woollard: I wanted to also talk about, they're taking page out of Netflix's book, there's sharing crackdown. We've heard this from them before, we heard it a lot more this time. They want that same success that Netflix had, they said it's one of these things that gives us confidence in our subscriber growth numbers. They really feel like they can do this. Is it the same thing? Is this an apples to apples comparison in your view?"", ""Rick Munarriz: On the one hand I would say no, Netflix has earned the right. They are the standard cable of streaming services. You have to have Netflix or not you're going to be relevant the next time you're together with friends talking about what they're watching on TV. Disney Plus is not so much that case, but again, if you have a family, you're going to need to watch Blue movie. The reason that a Moana movie is happening in November, they're working on a direct, it was going to be a series going to be on Disney Plus they said, this is coming out so great, we're going to turn it into an actual movie that will come out in November, was because the Moana movie was the most streamed movie on any platform including Netflix in terms of hours viewed in 2023. They have the data on what's important, they are very relevant in that regard. Let them flex their muscles. Netflix again, a lot of people said Netflix is going to suffer when they're cracking down on password sharing and now we've seen a couple of quarters and Netflix is doing just fine. I don't think every service can go ahead and do this, but again, you can't blame them, they're leaving money on the table. If they're letting people do this out of just the goodness of, we need our numbers, we can't churn, we can't have a high turnover rate. At the end of the day, Netflix is proving that we can do this, you can do this too."", ""Deidre Woollard: They tried a lot of things, they tried a lot of things this quarter. It was a great quarter. The market seems to love it so far. One person who didn't love it is Nelson Peltz, the activist investor who's been trying to get on the board and is still trying to get on the board. CNBC reached out to his company after the earnings and they said, we've seen this movie before. I don't know because they have this site called Restore the Badge and they've got these shareholder letters and just is pretty much doing everything that they asked them to do. What do you think they're trying to see here?"", ""Rick Munarriz: They got burned last time. They were going to have the proxy battle talk to Iger and they came to terms, it's all right, we're fine. We like what he's doing, and apparently there wasn't enough for them, so they're launching this other battle. They're going to be a little more skeptical this time around. But again, Disney did everything in this quarter, not so much, just blow out earnings and increase, they could probably have bigger savings than expected but just notice one thing that I think no one ever really talked about, but to me it's very interesting. It was February 7, 2024, and they announced a dividend increase that's going to happen in July. I've never seen a company announce an increase for something that happens five months from now. To me this was them saying, we know our annual shareholder meeting is in April. It is our last time to speak up. We're going to throw everything possible to load this chamber with everything we have. Tell you about that Moana movie in November that no one was expecting, all these other things that are happening. The dividend need is their way of saying, we have this. Again, 45 cents every six months for a stock that's over $100, that's less than 1% yield, a second excite income investors, but I do think it's definitely their way of saying, hey, we came to play with this earnings report and we had enough little stuff in there to please everybody. I don't think that Peltz will be successful this time, but it doesn't mean that he doesn't have good ideas."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah, that's true. Well, thanks for talking to us quickly Rick."", 'Rick Munarriz: Thank you.', ""Deidre Woollard: We talk about a lot of stocks on the show, but it's just a peek at the Motley Fools investing universe.

I spoke with Kirsten Guerra about the business behind the name."", ""We are in Valentine's week mode. It's love season, so people may be sending something special to someone special, but as you may have guessed, it also is a massive week for florists. In fact, I was doing a little digging with the Society of American Florist. It's about 30% of transactions. But we're not going to talk just flowers today, we're going to talk 1-800-Flowers, a ticker FLWS. Kristen, it's the flower company but it's a lot more, right?."", ""Kirsten Guerra: Yeah. The name here is a little deceptive and certainly outdated. Relatively, very few orders still come in through the phone despite the preserved toll free number and the dot com naming is a relic of its 1999 IPO, but it's a brand well known by the name. Today, 1-800-Flowers is only one brand under a much larger umbrella. In 2013, they started talking about what they call the celebratory ecosystem, which is their idea that they wanted to be like the go to place to order all types of gifts online, and that started a long series of acquisitions for them. Some may recognize acquired names like Shari's Berries, Shari's Cookies, things remembered, certainly Harry and David, in some cases, they built and launched a few lines of their own as well. So 1-800-Baskets, simply chocolate, things like that. What all that means to the end consumer is that if you're looking to send someone a gift, you can start on the website of any one of their properties and you're presented with a wide variety of options. Whether that's flowers, fruit baskets, popcorn, little monogrammed, knick-knacks through personalization mall, pastries through Wolferman's bakery, or even seafood through brands like Vital Choice. They've really tried to build out a one stop shop gift giving experience. Of course, they've also got a loyalty program to go along with that, where subscribers can get discounts, early access, free shipping, other benefits like that. In a way that works out for them if they send enough to gifts through the 1-800-Flowers ecosystem and that keeps the dedicated gift givers coming back. So yes, overall, certainly way more than flowers today."", ""Deidre Woollard: Celebratory ecosystem. Not a phrase I've heard before, but I love it."", ""Kirsten Guerra: No, for me I find it to be questionable branding. But it's not something that they sell with. It's just an internal name."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, one of the things that is anxiety provoking about when you're ordering things online is you never know if the picture that you're getting is what the recipient is getting. A lot of times there's that disappointment of like you see this beautiful bouquet or you see this abundant gift basket. Then the person sends you a picture of what they got and you're like, I don't know, but it seems like 1-800-Flowers. They're very into quality control and really delivering what's online, delivering on those expectations. How do they do some of that?"", ""Kirsten Guerra: That really is such an important part of gift delivery like this. Not only that the gift arrives looking how you expect, but also that it arrives exactly when you expect. In the logistics of that, to your point, is actually incredibly complicated. Especially when you consider that people often want to send flowers or gifts right around the same times of year, for example, Valentine's Day. There's an added layer of difficulty when you're telling customers like 1-800-Flowers is, hey, I see you're ordering flowers, would you like to add some chocolate covered strawberries to that? Fortunately, 1-800-Flowers started a heavy investment cycle around 2019 into the back and tech required to make those intelligent cross product suggestions for up cells, making sure that they're in the same warehouses for delivery and things like that. To that point they also revamped their warehouses to be brand agnostic, making it far easier to fulfill those multi-brand bundles and those are really key to the business. When I say multi-brand bundle, you can think like they mentioned actually in their latest earnings call in New Trio for them, which is a bundle of 1-800-Flowers, roses, Harry & David Wine, and Shari's berries chocolate-covered strawberries."", ""That's a multi-bundle or a multi-brand type of purchase. Only 13% of customers purchase multi-brand, but those multi-brand purchases account for 28% of revenue. That's a big area of potential future growth for them. It was critical, it turns out, very timely for them to make those big investments. Topping it off, they also layered on a lot of automation in their distribution center. For example, before they re outfitted one of their largest facilities in Ohio, it could handle around 80,000 packages on a peak day. Remember, peak days are critical for this company. They can generate a substantial amount of revenue, but all concentrated in deliveries that are supposed to go out on the same day, so 80,000 pre-automation and afterward that same facility, could handle 125,000. More than a 40% increase in output just in that one facility. All while cutting labor costs by about a third, which is really an even bigger deal for a company like this that requires a lot of seasonal workers. To your initial point that I think I've strayed from a bit, that automation also really helps ensure the consistent quality in all deliveries and also the quality of the product itself that 1-800-Flowers is really known for."", ""Deidre Woollard: I'm old enough to remember when the CEO, Jim McCann, used to do his 1-800-Flowers commercials on TV. I don't think he does that anymore. He was the CEO, he's now the CEO. Again, tell us a little bit about the McCann's because this is a family business."", ""Kirsten Guerra: Yeah. I don't think I've seen those commercials recently, but I have seen some of the old versions from the '90s and around that time. Jim McCann, a well known name and actually when I first mentioned this to Tim Buyers, he recognized him immediately from those commercials. But he founded the company under the name 1-800-Flowers back in 1995. He served as CEO then. He's still CEO today. But as you mentioned, there was there was some change there. Technically, his brother Chris McCann actually took over as CEO in 2016 and ran the company until last year in 2023 when he needed to step away for some personal health reasons. Now it's back with founder and CEO again, Jim McCann. One way or another, this has always been a family business between the two of them they still own 47% of the company. Of course, most of that with Jim McCann, who owns 45% of it nearly 30 years after founding it, which is very impressive that he's managed to hang onto so much of the business."", ""Deidre Woollard: He's very, very passionate about it. In the earnings, it's definitely clear that he's very identified with it."", ""Kirsten Guerra: Yeah, absolutely. This is his whole life, and he's done very well with it clearly."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, thinking about 1-800-Flowers in the whole business in general, there's been some consumer weakness in recent quarters with the business. Some of that might be reduced corporate giving. This the year of efficiency that has, a lot of companies have cut back on all sorts of things. But when you're looking at this company, how tightly tied do you think it is to the economy, to the ways that we spend, or do we just always have to give something if it's Valentine's Day or if it's Mother's Day. If you don't do it, you're going to be in trouble."", ""Kirsten Guerra: Yes. That's what I'm told. Flowers are considered an ephemeral gift, that's what they call them. They can't be used, they can't be consumed. That means that they are typically the first gift class that most people cut in tougher economic times. But as we've talked about 1-800-Flowers has diversified into a lot of other gift options. In fact, today, more than half of their revenue actually, comes from gourmet food and gift baskets. Roughly the other half comes from flowers, but still technically not as much from flowers today. That diversification in the steady stream of acquisitions over the years means that revenue at least has historically climbed every year, except through the great financial crisis, despite potential fluctuations in demand. Revenue did finally drop again in 2023, breaking that trend again amid economic pressure. But 1-800-Flowers talks about this. They break their revenue down into what they would call holidays in every day buckets, and they continue to see strong demand in the holidays category. To your question, yes, the gift giving pressure, especially around the holidays, will probably always exist and that adds some real stability to the business. More of the revenue fluctuation comes from the every day category. Which might be, for example, me sending you a thank you stake for having me on the podcast that's not necessarily recurring. But it's a one off I may feel compelled to send. Of course, the nature of that type of gift giving is always harder to predict and disappears quicker under economic pressure. But potentially has more room for upside as well. Because there's just more potential there."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, I'm curious a little bit about their membership thing. It sounds almost like a prime for gift givers. Is that the idea is to make a more steady revenue stream by encouraging people to send gifts for any reason at all?"", ""Kirsten Guerra: Yeah, I think that's the goal to add a little bit of recurring revenue, but maybe more so the ecosystem aspect, to have that competitive advantage where if you have, it's a little bit of sunk cost to a consumer. If you've already paid the upfront fee, which, oh, don't quote me offhand, I think it was like $20 or something. But if I've already paid that to get into the system, then the next time I'm thinking of sending flowers or sending a gift basket, I'm going to be compelled to go right back to 1-800-Flowers. Because not only have I bought into that system, I'm going to get free delivery on that next order. Maybe I also have some discount or coupon that they've given to me to come back to them and keep staying with them. I think it's more the ecosystem more than anything. But it seems to be working."", ""Deidre Woollard: I'm sure they email you frequently [laughs] to remind you to do it."", ""Kirsten Guerra: Yes, I have had to block them because as you know, I did do an order to just, as I was looking into this as a recommendation, I made an order just to test all of the things I've mentioned, the automation facilities, and see how they worked through all of that and they did well. But yes, there are a lot of emails that come with it around holidays, certainly reminding me to come right back to them."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, thinking about this as an investment, this is a company. It's being going through some stuff. You mentioned the investment in automation and in the warehouses there's signs of improvement which is great. Company probably doesn't have to do a lot to impress shareholders at this point because those expectations have been down and it's been trading at some low price to book value and price to sales multiples. You mentioned the quarter revenue was still down. They lowered their revenue guidance down to I think, seven to 9% for the year. What should we be looking at here?"", ""Kirsten Guerra: It's been very cheap recently based on how I valued the business at least. That's one of the benefits to having the outdated name and very few analysts that are following the business. There's not a lot of people looking at this. When there's not a lot of expectation baked in as you said, they don't have to do a lot to impress shareholders. Overall, the main goals of 1-800-Flowers as a company right now and what investors should really be looking for from them is a return to normal more than anything. We want to see the dissipation of economic pressure that's weighed on the top line. Hopefully see more of those everyday purchases come back and we want to see their gross margins return to historical levels for this company, which is around 41%. That fell to 37% recently with rises in freight costs and all the fluctuating commodity costs that we talked about, but they've already built that back to 39%. I actually started first looking at this company last year, when both the company's CFO and its president took money out of their own pockets to buy shares on the open market, where the CFO actually upped his stake by more than 12%."", ""That's a pretty clear sign that these insiders at least feel confident that their business is being significantly undervalued. Now I will say they bought at an average share price closer to $6 at the time. Right around the time of this recording, I think it's around 10. It's something to be aware of. But I would say that if they can manage to not only return to business as usual, which is the current goal, but also really leverage all of those tech in fulfillment investments to encourage more multi-brand bundles, attract more consistent gift givers into their loyalty program, and push further into corporate gift giving as you mentioned then, potentially it's still quite fairly valued at this point."", ""Deidre Woollard: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

Where do they go from here? Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined over the airwaves by Motley Fool analyst Tim Beyers. Tim, where is the caffeine meter checking in?"", ""Tim Beyers: It's all about survival today, Dylan. It's all about survival."", ""Dylan Lewis: [laughs] I hope that the rest of your day goes better than the way it started, but I do love that you are fully caffeinated and ready to go. We've got some huge names in the digital economy posting some big time results, and we're going to stop to smell the roses on a Valentine's Day stock. Tim, we're going to start with Uber because it is the end of an era at Uber. The company reported its Q4 results and its first ever full year profit. Important to note that while it did post 1.4 billion in net income, a billion of that was the investment income, but Tim, we had a legitimate operating income for a full year from Uber."", ""Tim Beyers: It's impressive. I have to give credit where it's due. There are some growth investors who saw this early on. We did make this a rerec in Rule Breakers about, I'm going to say, a little more than a year ago, but part of that was because of work done by others. I'll single out Henry Ellenbogen at Durable Capital, who was early on seeing just how good Uber was tracking. I've just a couple of numbers here, Dylan. There was a thesis for Uber that if they could start generating real meaningful gains in gross bookings. I'm not a big fan of adjusting anything, but management does get paid on what's called adjusted EBITDA. A lot of their incentives are tied to that. For those who don't know what EBITDA is, it's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, so think of it as earnings before really everything that matters."", 'Dylan Lewis: [laughs]', ""Tim Beyers: There's a real caveat here. When management tells you how they're going to get paid, you can expect them to focus on doing the things that are going to get them paid, and Dylan, they are doing the things that get them paid. Gross bookings were up 22% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was up to $1.3 billion during the quarter. That is up a full $618 million year-over-year, so not quite a double but very close to that. Their adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of gross bookings, in other words, getting leverage off of all of that business that's done on the Uber platform, that rose to 3.4%, which was up from 2.2%, so it's not right, even though Uber has been fairly criticized in the past of being a business that gets a lot of artificial sweetener and benefits from a ton of artificial sweetener, that is less and less true. In fact, I'd say for this fiscal year, Dylan, it really isn't true anymore. That's not what Uber is anymore."", ""Dylan Lewis: Tim, I was going to say Uber is like the poster child for adjusted results or has been for so much of its time as a business. You go back to 2016 all the way through to the first quarter of 2023, Uber collectively racked up close to 30 billion in operating losses, so a lot of what they were trying to get people to focus on were those adjusted numbers. I think even as we dive into this result and start looking at some of the elements that would lead to those adjustments, we're seeing positive signs, specifically, looking at things like stock based compensation."", ""Tim Beyers: When we look at SBC, so that is money that's paid out to employees in the form of stock. It's a non-cash expense, and that's been going down, not up. Uber, early in its life, did fund a lot of its more expensive endeavors by hiring very talented employees and giving them a lot of stock and deferring what would be legitimate expenses they have to pay in cash. That is, it's less of an issue now, Dylan. When we look at the cash flow statement here just year-over-year, in the fourth quarter here, stock-based compensation expense was 469 million. That would be a lot. It is a lot, but that's down from 482 million, in 2023, full on 1.9 billion, so yeah, that is a lot, and it's up a little bit from 1.8 billion. I'm rounding up here. If we really want to be specific, it's 1.94 billion versus 1.79 billion, but overall, I can't say this enough here, overall cash from operating activities. Note that I said the stock-based compensation for the full year is up, let's say, about 130 million. You know how much overall cash from operations was up during the fiscal year? It was up almost $3 billion, Dylan, so you can't say that it's just the artificial sweetener that is coming in and saving Uber. It's just not true. It's becoming a more efficient business. Trips are up, bookings are up, the core business, mobility was up 29% in the fourth quarter here. There are areas of the business that aren't holding up their end of the bargain. Freight was down 17% during the quarter, so it's not a perfect business, but the business is getting better and materially so."", ""Dylan Lewis: It feels like a great time to check in because we have these updated earnings results and because after the earnings response, stock is at an all time high. We are looking at Uber at $140 billion market cap. At this point, main competitor Lyft, a footnote at $5 billion It's hard to believe, Tim. How are you feeling about the business right now?"", ""Tim Beyers: I'm feeling pretty good about it. I'm not sure that I love the valuation here, Dylan, just because it is so massive. Having said that, this does happen from time to time where you have a company that has essentially taken a giant foot and stamped their primary competitor, and that is what's happened here. Uber is sucking the oxygen out of the room, and increasingly, they are taking the lion's share of the dollar spent on last mile logistics. As that pie grows, what we're really counting on is that there becomes a bigger demand overall for last mile logistics, delivery in its various forms and not just ride-sharing for people, delivery of groceries, delivery of other items, flowers, other types of convenience, and ultimately, I do think they've got to figure out freight in order to deliver meaningful multi-bagger returns from here. There are questions. The valuation is a little bit rich, but anybody that thinks that buying Lyft here because it's just a fraction of Uber, I think might be deluded."", 'Dylan Lewis: Similar story of industry dominance with Chipotle and restaurants and fast casual after reporting earnings, shares of CMG at all-time highs, Tim, this looks like one of those businesses where everything is working. Pick something, zoom in on it, and the numbers are going to be looking really strong.', ""Tim Beyers: It's pretty amazing. When we were talking off air here, comps, so same store sales up, 8.4%. The expectation was for a 7.1% increase. Think about that for a second. That the street was actually expecting a 7.1% increase, which is a lot, that is a lot for a company as big as Chipotle is right now. Instead, they come in with 8.4%. Just bananas, that's absolutely insane. Overall, Chipotle opened 121 new restaurants during the quarter, 110 locations include a Chipotlane drive-through, and this is something that I think is really interesting, Dylan. What these results tell me is that more and more of the square footage, including the drive-through, is delivering more efficiently for Chipotle. What's fascinating to me, this is a, more specific, industry report on the quarter from an industry trade publication called Restaurant Dive. The idea here is that apparently, Chipotle says they can get to 1,000 Chipotlane, in other words, drive-through versions of their restaurants. They are at 811 units right now and that includes conversions of their existing restaurants. It seems very likely here that what's driving Chipotle is two things, Dylan, first, better usage of the square footage they have for walk-in customers, but also really generating massive increases in order volume through those Chipotlanes. I think this is a business that's really got its mojo right now."", ""Dylan Lewis: I want to put the same question to you that we just discussed in the Uber conversation. Stocks at all time highs, it sounds like you're saying there are some good growth levers, especially with the Chipotlanes and what management has laid out there for the growth plans."", ""Tim Beyers: Yeah. They're not quite halfway to their overall goal of 7,000 restaurants in North America. I would say there's room to grow here, maybe not at the level that it has been growing. I'll just confess personally here, Dylan, that I have a fairly big position in Chipotle. There was a point about, I'm going to say three years ago, where for the individual portfolio it was in, it was a IRA, and it had occupied more than 50% of that IRA, so I sold down half of it. It is now climbing back toward close to half of that portfolio again. It's hard for me to see selling it here because the business is just getting increasingly better. I would not say that the valuation is cheap here. I need to do a little extra work on it, but boy, when you see a company that is executing at the unit level the way that Chipotle is, it's time to pay attention for sure."", ""Dylan Lewis: Tim, I think I speak for everyone when I say, I'm jealous of your problems. [laughs] We're going to wrap with a look at earnings from Roblox. Shares up 8% following the company's results that had better top line growth and narrower losses than expected. Beyond some of the top line numbers, when I look at this business, Tim, I always zoom right in on what we're seeing from the user metrics in particular. That's what makes the business go. It seems like we're seeing some pretty strong trends with those metrics this quarter."", ""Tim Beyers: The thing to pay attention on for Roblox is bookings and bookings for the quarter. We're up 25% year-over-year to 1.13 billion. I'm sorry, that was for the quarter, and for the year, 3.5 billion. That was up 23%. Bookings forecast continued revenue growth just by virtue of the way that people get in and engage with Roblox. For example, they'll spend money and buy additional digital goods, and then that revenue gets recognized over time. The bookings capture the business of the Roblox metaverse, and the revenue is what gets recognized that things get used in the Roblox universe, so you really want to pay attention to bookings here, but there's also, as you point out here, Dylan, really good activity metrics. Average daily active users, now up to 71.5 million. That's up 22% year-over-year, that's for the quarter, and for the full year, 68.4 million also up 22% year-over-year, but here's the really good metric here. I know we're audio here so you can't see me doing this, but if you want to think about how Roblox hockey sticks, there are two things. You want more daily active users. That's one thing that helps push the hockey stick up into the right. The other thing is the average bookings per that daily active user. If the number of users grows, and the amount they spend grows, you start getting up into the right. The average bookings per daily active user was $15.75 in the quarter, and that's up 3% year-over-year. That doesn't sound like a lot, and I get that that does not sound like a lot, but 3% on a vastly growing user base, Dylan, generates a whole lot of momentum. The Big Mo is really with Roblox right now."", ""Dylan Lewis: There are some interesting things in this company's future that I want to check in on. One of them is advertising, Tim. We're in the early innings here with this, and management has said, basically, it's not going to get split out, and it's not going to be something we can look at individually until it is material, but it came up 10 times in the company's earnings call, which to me is saying more and more people are starting to think about this and pay attention to it. How are you looking at it and the way it could potentially help this business?"", ""Tim Beyers: I think there is contextual advertising that really works inside of Roblox. We had things like performances inside Roblox, concerts, things like that. It's not a stretch to see the model of product placement that is so common in TV shows, and you've seen this. You watch your favorite police serial, and they're all using Dell Laptops. Who paid for that, Dylan? We know who paid for that, so product placement inside Roblox is natural. You could see this happening as the number of creative experiences and games multiply inside the Roblox universe. That increases the number of product placement opportunities. You could absolutely see why advertising is an area of discussion for Roblox. The thing that's going to make this better is something that we've yet to see. I need to go through the call to hear how they're doing more of this. The Roblox experience and the value of the platform multiplies when it's easier to create new experiences inside of Roblox. You take somebody who's a casual user of Roblox, maybe plays a game, and you make that person into a creator. One of the ways they want to do that is by automating the creation of experiences with AI. That's something they really care about, so if we have that, and the platform multiplies, and you get an explosion of creativity inside Roblox, one of the happy byproducts of that can be this really interesting advertising revenue stream that surfaces and delivers at a very high margin level, so it's an exciting time. It's a lot still to be worked out, but it is an exciting time."", 'Dylan Lewis: To use a tweak on a famous quote. If you build it, they will come and create and advertise, Tim.', 'Tim Beyers: We hope.', 'Dylan Lewis: We hope. Tim Beyers, thanks for joining me today.', 'Tim Beyers: Thanks, Dylan.', 'Dylan Lewis: Coming up, what would dating profiles look like for stocks? My colleague Mary Long cut up with Motley Fool senior analyst, Asit Sharma, to figure out which companies would make good long-term partners for investors.', ""Mary Long: Asit, Valentine's Day is just around the corner, and we're celebrating on Motley Fool Money with some love-minded episodes over the next few days. To kick that off, thought we'd play a fun little game, like a business-oriented version of The Bachelor, if you will. I have taken the time to scour through the dating profiles of some eligible companies, and I want to talk through them with you and see which out of these four contestants might wind up with a final rose from you, an investor. You ready to play?"", ""Asit Sharma: Mary, I am so ready to play. Love is in the air. Valentine's Day is coming up, and I'm such a picky bachelor. Let's get this show on the road."", ""Mary Long: Let's get this started and see who can win over your investment analyst heart. Our first contestant goes by the name of MicroStrategy, and on the surface, this is your classic tech bro, an enterprise software company that has a Cloud infrastructure business, an analytic segment, and of course, has its hands in AI. That all might sound nice and shiny enough, but there is a catch. MicroStrategy seems to be the person at the table who just can't stop talking about crypto. In 2020, the company made abrupt decision to start hoarding Bitcoin. They've been around since 1989, a legacy software business, so it seems like quite the pivot. How did we get here, Asit?"", ""Asit Sharma: It's a great question. This is one of those partners that you start dating because they look so good, then you get a sense of the personality. How we got here, there was this slow accumulation of cash on MicroStrategy's balance sheet. That is boring. Sorry, I can be a little disparaging here. That's so boring, mid link enterprise business, but they had a steady accumulation of cash flow over the years, and their CEO Michael Saylor started thinking about this cash that was sitting there, and he was also getting a little skeptical of the strength of the US dollar over the long term. A funny thing happened, this was during the pandemic, when all of us were holed up in our houses, on Zoom a lot, watching crazy stuff on the markets, and cryptos among other topics. He started to think, look, there's something here on this long-term store of value story I'm hearing about Bitcoin. The dollar is going to decrease. I think inflation is going to increase. Of course, if we go back to 2020, that was the time of low interest rate. He started subtly talking up in conference calls the fact that that money on the balance sheet was just going to lose its value. He would say it's going to get inflated away, and lo and behold, one day in July of 2020, he tells the analysts on the call, hey, we're looking for some alternative investments. Who wants to put money in the bank? We're looking at silver, gold, and bitcoin. That's how this story started."", ""Mary Long: Apart from this Bitcoin interest, we can make exceptions for the right person. Apart from this massive bitcoin crypto interest, is there promise in MicroStrategy's software business? Can you even separate the company at this point from its Bitcoin holdings?"", ""Asit Sharma: I should say, like any decent software business that has enterprise customers, sure, there's some promise in it, but it has been a very slow growth story. It's stable. A little bit of a boring business. Those who have followed MicroStrategy and Michael Saylor have watched them put all their available cash into Bitcoin, even take on more money, take on debt to buy more Bitcoin, so there's this quasi investment vehicle for people who want to participate in Bitcoin, but don't want to worry about the complexity of holding the asset. When you look at now this business that's got one shoe in Bitcoin and the other and its core revenue stream, it's still easy to separate them out if you look at the financial summary, so you can follow along the operations of the business, but some of this starts to bleed into each other. For example, Michael Saylor has been fond of saying, hey, if you invest with us, you don't have to worry about the fee you'd pay to custody your crypto assets, but look, they have a lot of expenditure for a small company in custodying the asset themselves, the insurance, the due diligence, the accounting, internal controls, and reporting. All that is a cost that actually gets buried in the G&A, general and administrative section of their core operation. There are better things out there. I want to say the last, before we move on, about this dating candidate, it's also not just like the crypto bro-type partner, but the type of partner, your friends, who say you could do better. If you want to buy an enterprise software business, there are plenty of great ones out there. If you want to hold bitcoin now there are spot ETFs that make it really super simple for the investor to get involved. I don't know about this one, Mary. It is not pushing up my romance meter at this point in the game."", ""Mary Long: We've got other contestants that might be more appealing, so let's move on to them. Up next, we've got a date that has stories galore. Disney knows how to tell a good tale, but the company is going through some tough times. Disney spent a lot of money to sit at the cool kids table aka to join the streaming club, and now, despite having more than 150 million subscribers, Disney Plus and the company's other direct-to-consumer entertainment offerings have yet to generate a single quarter of positive operating profits. How did the House of Mouse fall so far?"", ""Asit Sharma: I like that you characterize it that way, Mary, because I actually like dating people on the rebound. I find sometimes that it's easier to find a partner than going out there and doing the hard work of someone who's, like, already taken. Let's talk about Disney here. As it relates to your question on streaming content, the first thing Disney did was to misprice its IP in the market placement. They had these great assets that they had developed over decades. They come into the game to compete against the likes of Netflix and really have what I thought was a great entry point. This is a few years ago when they started their digital streaming business. From the beginning, they should have priced their subscription services a little higher. This year, they bumped up their subscription prices by about 27% without much pushback from customers. They've also started to have that ad-supported tier that we see Netflix and other companies engaging with. Another thing I think that Disney got wrong was they took a lot of time to get their cost structure right for new streaming content. This was mostly under the former CEO Bob Chapek. This is Bob Iger's handpicked successor. The other thing that Chapek did, which was hard on this streaming business, was he took too much control out of the hands of creatives and how they would manage their budgets, the kinds of ways they could dream, and then put those dreams into production on a cost effective basis. I think Bob Iger righted a lot of this, and he's making it into a more efficient business."", ""Mary Long: Let's talk about those characters, Bob Chapek and Bob Iger, because in addition to all this baggage that we've just discussed, it seems like there's another wrinkle in this Disney character, which is that they might have a bit of a helicopter parent. Bob Iger, left the company, then Bob Chapek stepped in, then Bob Iger came back. Is Iger what the company needs right now, or are Disney's current growing pains due to the fact that this is a parent who can't let its child leave the nest?"", 'Asit Sharma: It\'s so complicated. I have so many thoughts on this. I am a parent. I have for a really teeny, brief period been a helicopter parent, but for those out there who have seen their colleagues become helicopter parents, there\'s nothing more maddening. Perhaps there\'s some truth in this that Iger is helicoptering a bit, but truthfully a little bit of this is on him. He misread the capabilities and business acumen of his handpicked successor, and so he created some of the problems. Now he\'s coming in to try to fix it, so maybe we shouldn\'t say he\'s a 100% helicopter parent. He is helicoptering, but I think he sees himself more as like the hero in this story. There is a wonderful song by the indie artist M. Ward, who I think many more people should listen to. The song is called Helicopter. In this song, the protagonist has a great line. After he saves a relationship, he says, ""Helicopter, helicopter, let your long rope down. Let us sway into the sunset. I have done all I can do in this town,"" and I think that\'s how Iger sees himself. He\'s coming to fix this problem. He\'s not helicoptering down. He\'s going to fix it. In 2026, if everything works out well, the rope will drop, he\'ll go off into the sunset.', ""Mary Long: I dig to a beautiful tale. Our next contestant goes by the name of ServiceNow. Also a tech bro, they're an enterprise software company that helps businesses replace manual processes with digital ones. Basically, the name of the game here is productivity. ServiceNow seeks to sign up some of the largest companies in the world as its clients. Because of that, it faces competition from big names like Oracle and smaller but crafty players like Atlassian. Going up against that competition requires some big dollars, but ServiceNow doesn't love to spend on acquisition. Is this company a big spender? What money is ServiceNow spending on research and development or sales and marketing?"", ""Asit Sharma: When you put them both together, Mary, they are a pretty big part of the company's cost structure. In the last trailing 12 months, general and administrative expenses have been about 46% of the company's top line, and R&D has comprised about 24% of every dollar of revenue. When you look at those together, they've been actually a little bit equal to gross profit for the last several years. ServiceNow has had anemic profits for such a big company and one that has these great relationships with enterprise customers, but in the last couple of years, especially in the last 12-18 months, they've hit that magical thing that every big company strives for. They've hit scale. Now you're starting to see that gross profit is growing in excess of the combination of sales and marketing expenses, G&A, and research and development. They spend big money, but they're getting a yield out of that."", ""Mary Long: They're spending big money. How do they act when it comes to tipping? Are they generous, or are they a bit stingy there? Basically, what's their stock-based compensation system look like? Does that change this earnings picture at all?"", ""Asit Sharma: They're a very handsome tipper. They have a very large percentage of their expenses that are expressed as stock-based compensation, meaning, thereby, if you're paying your employees a certain dollar amount, when we say stock-based compensation is high, it means the employees are getting a lot of stock as well as salary, and that dilutes shareholders, but I think ServiceNow gets a great yield out of that. They compensate a small army of software engineers and they're technically better than so many companies they compete with. They were able to pivot very quickly into generative AI, had great relationships with Nvidia. The core structure of their platform is very sophisticated. Now they're selling a lot of AI services that have a good return on investment. Not just like window dressing, AI-type stuff. The real core AI businesses that help companies get a little bit more productive. By the way, used that word earlier, Mary, productive is one of those characteristics that starts to get me flirting. When I see a company's productive, I start looking their way."", ""Mary Long: Last but not least in our lineup, we've got a character who's a little bit different than our other contestants. Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a dreamer. The biotech company builds innovative therapies to address and potentially eradicate severe diseases, especially cystic fibrosis. But, Asit, lots of people, lots of companies have big dreams. Vertex stands out from the pack by not just having big dreams but being pretty stable. They're a stable biotech, and you don't often hear those two words, stable and biotech go together. How has Vertex managed to find stability in an otherwise volatile sector."", ""Asit Sharma:\xa0Vertex got an early lock on the cystic fibrosis market through a drug called Trikafta. This is a drug that has helped a lot of people around the world deal with their CF, cystic fibrosis, and they've done really well at expanding the drug around the world and also getting approvals to market it to younger populations. That's been its core, stable revenue stream. For someone who has been through several relationships in his life, when you get to that person who has that steady income, they don't have a lot of emotional baggage, but they've got some fun things about them. Think they're ready to do new things, novel things, travel. You start looking at them as well and I think this is something that Vertex is very good at. Mary, you were talking about this when we were prepping for the show. That you think they've got some interesting other parts of their business that we should look at?"", 'Mary Long: The thing with dreams is they just keep going. Keep expanding. What other therapies is Vertex exploring beyond cystic fibrosis?', ""Asit Sharma: Sure. They've got a whole host of therapies in their pipeline, and they're all really ambitious. So just briefly, one is called Casgevy. I hope I pronounced that correctly. That's a gene editing therapy that they have developed alongside their partner CRISPR Therapeutics. It treats sickle cell disease. Also, something called transfusion-dependent Beta-thalassemia, which has to do with anemia in the blood. Both of these or this drug in both forms has just received approval from the FDA recently, so they're off to the racist with this therapy. They also have something that a lot of people are paying attention to called VX-548. This is a drug that's in development. It's a non-opioid pain drug. The potential, if it works out, is to really replace some of the potentially addictive medicines that some patients are reluctant to take when they have pain medication. Finally, they have something called inaxaplin. This targets APOL1-mediated kidney disease. It's in pivotal clinical testing. Now they've got a slew of other therapies that we don't have time to discuss, but this just gives you a picture. It's an ambitious company which is trying to lean on those stable cash flow streams that it's got from its CF drugs and move into different parts of the market and just get even stronger."", ""Mary Long: Asit, we've gone through a number of contestants, each with some green flags, some red flags. Out of these four lovely options for you, we've got MicroStrategy, Disney, ServiceNow, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which company are you giving your final rose to today?"", ""Asit Sharma:\xa0First, I have to say to all four companies, I really think there's something nice about each of them. I don't want anyone to go home heartbroken. They've all got some type of future, but I have to say that my rose goes to ServiceNow. This is a company that is executing on all fronts. It's just getting bigger at scale, and it is relentlessly ambitious. They're the kind of partner that I think always keeps it exciting and is always investing for the future. I like long-term relationships, and I think I could be happy with this one for a long time from now."", ""Mary Long: I wish you and ServiceNow a very happy future together. I'm so glad that we got to see the start of this budding romance here on Motley Fool Money."", ""Asit Sharma: Thank you so much, Mary, for being so patient as we worked through these very fine candidates, and now I'm off to my date."", 'Mary Long: [laughs]', ""Dylan Lewis: As always, people in the program may own stocks mentioned, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis. Thanks for listening. We'll be back tomorrow."", 'Asit Sharma has positions in Atlassian, Roblox, ServiceNow, Walt Disney, and Zoom Video Communications.

By achieving its sustainability targets, Colgate-Palmolive can enhance its brand image, attract eco-conscious consumers, and differentiate itself from competitors, while contributing positively to the environment and society."", ""Regulatory and Legal Challenges: As a global entity, Colgate-Palmolive is subject to extensive governmental regulations across different markets.

Under the pact, an independent expert would survey the jobs in question and make recommendations to the company to ensure its policies are consistent with equal-pay laws.', 'James Finberg and John Mullan, lawyers for the plaintiffs, said the work their firms logged over almost seven years exceeded the $8.3 million they’re requesting in fees, but emphasized that they didn’t want to take away more from the recovery for their clients.', 'Each woman’s actual payout in the accord would vary depending on how much compensation they received during their time at Oracle.', '‘Excellent Result’', 'In a court filing Tuesday requesting court approval of the settlement, the lawyers hailed it as an “excellent result” in light of the risks they faced trying to get class status reinstated on appeal and taking the case to trial, as well as the likelihood that even if they won, any payout would be delayed by appeals.', 'The filing cited in particular the decision by San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Raymond Swope two years ago to reverse his historic ruling in 2020 granting class-action status to the three women who filed the original complaint.', 'In his reconsideration of the issue, Swope agreed with Oracle that it would be unmanageable to go to trial with a class of more than 3,000 employees in 125 different job classifications.', 'The company had argued that the lawsuit wrongly compared women and men tagged with the same job codes even though such coding doesn’t mean the work requires similar skills, effort or responsibility, because Oracle’s products and services vary so widely.', 'Swope has scheduled an April 8 hearing for preliminary settlement approval.', '“As a woman who’s spent her entire career in the tech industry, I’m optimistic that the actions Oracle has agreed to take as part of this settlement will ensure more equity for women,” Marilyn Clark, one of the named plaintiffs, said in a statement.', 'Now it’s Amazon’s turn to face gender-pay disparity allegations.

Tech giants, start-ups, and governments are looking to get their hands on the most powerful chips available in the market to train AI models and deploy AI applications.', 'According to Deloitte, the market for generative AI chips could exceed $50 billion in revenue in 2024, up from almost nothing in 2022. Nvidia has been a big beneficiary of this booming demand for AI chips. Its revenue in the latest fiscal year 2024 is estimated to have increased to just over $59 billion, which would be a whopping 119% increase over the previous year.', ""What's more, Nvidia's dominant share of the AI chip market and the long-term growth opportunity illustrate why analysts are forecasting its earnings to double each year for the next five years. All this indicates that shares of Nvidia could keep heading higher following tremendous gains of 231% in the past year."", ""However, investors shouldn't miss the fact that there are other ways to capitalize on the AI chip market. While Nvidia is known for providing graphics processing units (GPUs) for training AI models, Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) also supply critical hardware and technological know-how to help accelerate AI adoption."", ""Let's look at the reasons why buying these two AI stocks instead of Nvidia could turn out to be a smart long-term move."", ""Arm Holdings stock experienced a major breakout of late following the release of the company's fiscal 2024 third-quarter earnings on Feb. 7."", ""Investors are buying Arm stock hand over fist since its latest quarterly report, and a big reason why is that Arm now joined the league of companies benefiting from the AI revolution. The British company, which doesn't manufacture any chips of its own but licenses chip architecture and designs to other chipmakers, saw a sharp jump in the number of Arm Total Access (ATA) agreements in the previous quarter thanks to AI."", ""Arm signed five ATA agreements in fiscal Q3. This took the company's total number of ATAs to 27. That's a nice jump considering that Arm reported 18 ATAs at the end of fiscal 2023 and had signed only four such agreements in the first six months of the current fiscal year. This improvement in the number of ATAs bodes well for Arm's future as it generates more revenue than other plans."", 'Jason Child, Arm\'s CFO, remarked on the latest earnings conference call, ""As with recent quarters, we expect to sign multiple new ATA deals in Q4, and demand for our latest technology remains high as customers need access to AI-capable CPUs and related technology, such as our compute subsystems.""', ""What's more, the adoption of AI led to a jump in demand for the company's latest Armv9 architecture, which it says commands double the royalty rates of the previous generation Armv8 architecture. That's not surprising as Arm designed the Armv9 architecture with an eye on improving AI processing capabilities such as voice recognition and image processing."", ""The Armv9 architecture accounted for 15% of Arm's royalty revenue in the previous quarter, which was an improvement over the architecture's 10% contribution in the previous quarter. As the demand for AI-enabled smartphones and personal computers (PCs) increases, Arm believes it could witness stronger demand for Armv9."", 'The good part is that the AI-driven interest in Arm\'s architecture and intellectual properties substantially improved its revenue pipeline. Its remaining performance obligations (RPO) stood at $2.43 billion at the end of the previous quarter, up 38% from the year-ago period. RPO refers to the amount of revenue that Arm will recognize in future periods, and this metric improved substantially last quarter as the company signed ""multiple high-value, long-term deals.""', ""This also explains why Arm's top-line growth is set to step on the gas following an estimated jump of 18% in the current fiscal year to $3.18 billion."", ""The company is also expected to deliver 41% annual earnings growth for the next five years. But don't be surprised to see Arm do better than that as more companies line up to sign long-term agreements and use its architecture to develop AI chips, which could help the company clock faster-than-expected growth in the coming years."", ""The rapid deployment of AI servers created the need for more high-bandwidth memory (HBM). That's because HBM allows for faster transfer of data compared to traditional memory chips, which makes it essential for tackling AI workloads wherein large datasets are processed in real time."", ""This explains why top chipmakers such as Nvidia are looking to get their hands on as much HBM as possible to manufacture their AI graphics cards. In December last year, Taiwan-based publication DigiTimes reported that Nvidia paid $770 million to Micron as an advance to secure the supply of the latter's latest-generation HBM."", 'Nvidia reportedly plans to deploy Micron\'s HBM3E product in its new AI chips this year. Comments from Micron\'s management on the company\'s December 2023 earnings conference call indicate something similar: ""Micron is in the final stages of qualifying our industry-leading HBM3E to be used in NVIDIA\'s next generation Grace Hopper GH200 and H200 platforms.""', 'Based on customer feedback, Micron points out that its version of HBM3E memory ""has approximately 10% better performance and about 30% lower power consumption compared to competitive offerings of HBM3E."" If that\'s indeed the case, it won\'t be surprising to see Micron cornering a nice share of the fast-growing HBM market.', ""According to market research provider Yole Group, HBM shipments could jump 147% this year, generating $14 billion in revenue. That would be a significant jump over last year's shipment growth of 93%. Even better, HBM shipments are expected to clock a compound annual growth rate of 45% through 2029, generating almost $38 billion in revenue at the end of the forecast period."", ""With Micron commanding an estimated 25% of the market for next-generation memory chips such as HBM, the company is in a nice position to take advantage of this emerging opportunity within the memory industry. Throw in the fact that Micron's top line is expected to jump 46% in the current fiscal year to $22.7 billion followed by another significant jump next year thanks to the improving memory market conditions, and investors would do well to buy it while it is still cheap."", 'Micron is trading at just 5.8 times sales, a nice discount to other AI stocks such as Nvidia that command an expensive price-to-sales ratio of 40. This makes buying Micron stock a no-brainer considering how fast it is set to grow and the lucrative AI chip opportunity it could take advantage of.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?"", ""Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Micron (MU) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage."", 'Micron currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.32, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.32 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.', 'Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 22 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 81.5% and 7.4% of all recommendations.', 'Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MU', 'Check price target & stock forecast for Micron here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Micron, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is MU Worth Investing In?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Micron, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.1% over the past month to -$0.43.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Micron.

Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 21% seen by Tripadvisor over the last five years is not surprising. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline.

The move comes even as UPS adjusts its air network to align with lower volumes.', 'Chief Financial Officer Brian Newman disclosed on the company’s Jan. 30 earnings briefing that UPS (NYSE: UPS) acquired the large cargo jets from Qatar Airways, as the world’s largest cargo airline – not including the express parcel carriers – moves to an all-777 fleet. Atlanta-based UPS said in its 2022 annual report last February that it had committed to buy two used jumbo freighters but did not identify their source.', 'UPS expects to bring the used 747-8s into service sometime between the end of the year and early 2025, spokeswoman Michelle Polk said by email. The transition period is impacted by the need for modifications to standardize the aircraft to UPS specifications and paint them with the UPS color scheme.', 'It also stems from the fact that one of the 747-8s is still operating for Qatar Airways Cargo, according to Flightradar24. The tracking site shows the freighter departed Hong Kong for Doha, Qatar, on Thursday.', 'Newman linked the deal to UPS’ fleet modernization and effort to retire aging MD-11 freighters in favor of more efficient, cleaner-burning aircraft. Polk added that the 747-8s were also acquired because they provide needed capacity on certain international corridors.', 'UPS Airlines currently operates 28 Boeing 747-8 freighters, the largest such fleet in the world.', '', 'The integrated logistics provider phased out six MD-11s last year and one in January, bringing the active fleet to 35. The retirement schedule was moved up when international parcel and freight demand began to contract in mid-2022 from the heights of the COVID crisis. Management has said it plans to retire eight more MD-11s this year and the type will be replaced by 28 factory-built 767-300 cargo jets previously ordered from Boeing.', 'The MD-11 and 767 are both widebody aircraft, but the 767 is smaller.', 'Although the 747-8 has one more engine than the tri-jet MD-11, it still provides better fuel efficiency on an equivalent payload basis, according to UPS.', 'The GEnx engine on the 747-8 is about 15% more efficient than the CF6 that is prevalent on UPS’ MD-11 fleet, according to GE. Mike Stengel, a principal at Aerodynamic Advisory, said the remaining Pratt & Whitney 4000 engines that power the fleet are assumed to be comparable to the CF6 in fuel efficiency since the engines were developed around the same time.', 'The 747-8’s payload is about 45% greater than that of the MD-11, “so the unit economics still probably favor the 747-8 freighter even with the extra engine. The 747-8 also offers 600 to 700 miles more range” and is likely much more reliable, Stengel said.', 'The two 747-8s from Qatar Airways Cargo are about 7 and 11 years old. UPS’ MD-11 fleet ranges in age from 23.5 years to nearly 33 years.', 'The acquisition of two large freighters comes even as UPS reduces flight schedules and temporarily parks some aircraft to save money during the shipping downturn.', 'UPS’ flight activity in December and January was down 16% year over year, according to research by Morgan Stanley. The company has said it doesn’t expect volumes to pick up until the second half of the year.', 'In the fourth quarter, UPS reported declines in both domestic and international parcel volume from the prior year. International average daily volume was down 8.3%, with export oriented parcel volume down 5.9%. Revenue fell 7.8% to nearly $24.9 billion. Net income was more than halved to $1.6 billion.', 'Qatar Airways fleet', 'Qatar Airways Cargo currently operates 27 Boeing 777 freighters. It recently let go of two Boeing 747-400s that were leased as well as some Airbus aircraft. A Qatar Airways executive recently said at a Cargo Facts event that the airline is quickly transitioning to simplify the fleet around the 777, the trade publication reported.', 'Qatar Airways is the launch customer for the next-generation 777X freighter from Boeing, with an order for 34 aircraft.', 'Click here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.', 'Sign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.', 'UPS begins phaseout of older MD-11 cargo jets', 'Boeing lands Qatar Airways as first customer for 777X freighter', 'The post UPS to deploy 747-8 freighters from Qatar Airways by early 2025 appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

Investors adopting the GARP approach prefer buying stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsA strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 30% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another metric that growth and GARP investors consider is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for a strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Stocks with positive cash flows find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing prioritizes the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios.

Since then, its investment in the bank holding and payments giant has grown to $32 billion, and it received approximately $352 million in dividends in 2023 alone. Despite not buying any additional shares of American Express since 1995, Berkshire's stake has grown from nearly 10% to 21% stake through steady buybacks."", ""Today, American Express stock trades near an all-time high, so it might sound ridiculous to consider it cheap. However, when examining the financial giant's recent financial performance, its valuation could be considered cheap by certain metrics. So, let's dive into why American Express is a favorite stock of Warren Buffett's and why it is just as worthy of buying today as it was in the early 1990s."", 'American Express recently released its 2023 financial results, and it was a record-setting year on the top and bottom lines for the nearly 174-year-old payments company. Specifically, it generated $60.5 billion in revenue in 2023 and produced diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $11.21, a year-over-year uptick of 14% for each metric.', 'Additionally, management offered strong guidance for 2024, forecasting revenue growth of 9% to 11% and diluted EPS growth of 13% to 17%, which would bring it to a range of $12.65 to $13.15.', 'In light of its strong revenue and earnings growth, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.70 per share. At the share price as of this writing, that gives it a 1.3% annual yield.', 'One of Warren Buffet\'s favorite financial metrics -- one that has called out multiple times in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders -- is retained earnings, which measures a company\'s net earnings minus all dividends paid. Buffett wrote in his 2020 annual shareholder letter that retained earnings allow companies ""to expand their business, make acquisitions, pay off debt and, often, to repurchase their stock (an act that increases our share of their future earnings).""', 'In 2023, American Express recorded a net income of $8.4 billion and distributed $1.6 billion to its shareholders as dividends, giving it retained earnings of $6.8 billion for the year. Utilizing some of this surplus, it acquired Nipendo, a payments company headquartered in Israel, for an undisclosed amount.', ""Over the past two years, management has smartly reduced its net debt (total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) by 88%, from $16.9 billion to $2 billion. As a result, it won't be saddled with paying high-interest expenses or relying on expensive debt while interest rates are at elevated levels."", ""Additionally, management has repurchased nearly 3% of the company's shares outstanding over the past year, lowering its share count to 723 million. The company is in the early stages of a 120 million share repurchase program announced in March 2023."", 'In Buffett\'s latest letter to shareholders, he wrote about why stock repurchases are shareholder-friendly: ""The math isn\'t complicated: When the share count goes down, your interest in our many businesses goes up. Every small bit helps if repurchases are made at value-accretive prices.""', ""American Express operates differently from its larger competitors in that it acts as a closed-loop network compared to Mastercard's (NYSE: MA) and Visa's (NYSE: V) open-loop networks. The main distinction is that American Express issues credit and manages its transactions, while other major financial institutions support Mastercard and Visa cards. American Express enjoys the advantage of charging higher fees to merchants and accruing interest from the transactions within its system. However, the downside is American Express is accepted less widely, has higher credit card rewards and member services expenses, and assumes greater risk from defaults."", ""Digging into American Express' 2023 financials, the company's expenses for card member rewards rose 10% to $15.4 billion, and card member services expenses jumped 34% to $4 billion. But the more significant concern for American Express is that defaults will rise as interest rates remain elevated. The company increased its total provisions for credit losses by 123% from $2.2 billion in 2022 to $4.9 billion in 2023. Those estimated losses represent a non-cash expense to cover anticipated losses expected to occur within the next year, typically from defaults or unrecoverable debts."", ""Despite some concerns, the expansion of American Express' business has propelled its stock upward. While labeling its stock as cheap might seem contradictory in that context, based on its valuation metrics, the company still appears undervalued compared both to its historical benchmarks and industry peers."", ""American Express stock currently trades at 8.3 times free cash flow, which isbelow its three-year average of 9.6 for that metric. Moreover, its price-to-free-cash-flow ratio is significantly lower than Mastercard's ratio 39.5 or Visa's ratio of 29.5. The wide difference is partly due to the difference between their business models. Still, given the fact that American Express has a significantly higher three-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for free cash flow, the stock looks underpriced."", 'Metric', 'American Express', 'Mastercard', 'Visa', 'Free cash flow (TTM)', '$18.9 billion', '$10.9 billion', '$19.1 billion', 'Market capitalization', '$152.7 billion', '$428.2 billion', '$560 billion', 'Price-to-free-cash-flow ratio', '8.3', '39.5', '29.5', '3-year free cash flow CAGR', '69.5%', '18.7%', '26.8%', 'Data source: Finance Charts. Chart by author.', ""When a stock hits an all-time high, it's common for investors to assume it's overpriced, which often leads them to conclude they should wait for a pullback before considering a purchase.

And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

I'm pleased to report 2023 was the safest and most profitable year in Martin Marietta's history. We delivered both record financial performance, eclipsing $2.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and also world-class safety results, achieving a world-class total injury incident rate for the third year in a row and a world-class lost-time incident rate for the seventh consecutive year. This year was also highlighted by several portfolio enhancing transactions significantly strengthening both the durability of our business and our balance sheet and which cumulatively, positions us well to continue delivering sustainable growth. Our 2023 achievements were accomplished despite a macroeconomic environment encumbered by restrictive monetary policy, a housing slowdown, and heightened geopolitical tensions."", ""That our team was able to successfully overcome these challenges further underscores the continued success of our strategic operating analysis and review or SOAR plan, the vitality of our purposely curated geographic footprint, our team's steadfast execution of our proven value over volume commercial strategy, and the resiliency and earnings power of our aggregates-led business. Subsequent to year-end, on January 12th, we closed the acquisition of Albert Frei & Sons, a leading aggregates producer in Colorado, expanding our aggregates platform in the high-growth Denver metropolitan area. More recently, on February 11, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Alabama, South Carolina, South Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia aggregates operations of Blue Water Industries, a closely held pure-play aggregates producer with a portfolio of 20 active operations and attractive Southeast markets, including Nashville, Knoxville, and Miami."", ""Consistent with our SOAR plan upon closing of the Blue Water Industries acquisition, which is expected to occur later this year, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, these two pure-play aggregates transactions will not only add approximately 1 billion tons of high-quality reserves in specific SOAR-targeted markets, but also enhance the product mix of our portfolio. Assuming these transactions have closed on January 1, 2024, we would have expected these two acquisitions to generate approximately $180 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2024, more than offsetting the adjusted EBITDA divested in the February 9, 2024 sale of the company's South Texas Cement and related concrete business. As we turn the page to 2024, favorable commercial dynamics underpinned by our value over volume pricing strategy and giving effect to the recently closed Colorado acquisition and Texas divestiture, we expect to deliver consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $2.24 billion at the midpoint."", ""However, assuming these transactions and the recently announced Bluewater Industries' acquisition had all been completed as of January 1, 2024, we would have expected the new portfolio to generate adjusted EBITDA of $2.37 billion in 2024 at the midpoint. Before discussing our full year 2023 results, I'll highlight a few notable takeaways from our record fourth quarter. Aggregates pricing increased 15%, driving product line gross profit of $328.6 million, a year-over-year increase of 36.8% and gross profit per ton of $7.04, a year-over-year increase of 39.8%, both fourth quarter records. While aggregate shipments decreased 2.1%, these financial results clearly demonstrate the success of our sales team's commitment to receiving appropriate commercial consideration for our valuable and long-lived reserves."", 'The primary and disproportionate organic earnings growth driver of our business. Turning now to our full year 2023 results. As previously noted, we established new financial records in each of the following year-over-year metrics. Consolidated total revenues of $6.8 billion, a 10% increase. Consolidated gross profit of $2 billion, a 42.1% increase. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $19.32, a 41% increase. Adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 billion, a 33% increase and aggregates gross profit per ton of $6.93, a 46.4% increase. Moreover, we successfully implemented midyear price increases across the majority of our markets as we endeavor to pass through persistently high cost inflation. Shifting now to our full year 2023 operating performance beginning with aggregates.', ""Aggregate shipments declined 4.3%, the combined result of our value over volume strategy and softer demand in certain Midwest and Southwest markets, partially offset by continued strength in key Southeast markets. Aggregates pricing increased to 18.9% or 17.2% on a mix-adjusted basis as pricing fundamentals remain attractive. Texas Cement shipments decreased 3.4% to 4 million tonnes. Pricing increased 22% or 21.6% on a mix-adjusted basis, driven by favorable supply/demand dynamics in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready-mixed concrete shipments decreased 12.1%, but that reduction was largely driven by the April 2022 divestiture of the company's Colorado and Central Texas concrete businesses. Pricing increased a robust 20.4%."", 'Asphalt shipments increased 3.5% and pricing increased 6.7%. Before providing end market trends and our 2024 outlook, Jim will now discuss our full year financial results. Jim?', 'Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward and good morning everyone. As Ward mentioned, we completed the sale of our South Texas Cement plant and related concrete operations last week on February 9th. While these businesses were classified as held for sale on the balance sheet as of December 31st, revenues and profits from these operations through the divestiture date are included in the earnings from continuing operations. Accordingly, the revenues and profits from these assets are included in both 2023 as reported earnings from continuing operations and in our 2024 earnings guidance through the February 9th close date. The revenues and profits from the Colorado assets acquired on January 12th, 2024, also are included in our forward earnings guidance.', 'Lastly, the Bluewater Industries transaction has not yet closed and remain subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory review. Accordingly, the contributions from the pending acquisitions are not included in our 2024 earnings guidance. That said, we will provide updated earnings guidance after closing Bluewater transaction, which is expected to occur later this year. The Building Materials business posted full year 2023 revenues of $6.5 billion, an increase of 10.3% and gross profit of $1.9 billion, a notable 43.7% increase year-over-year, both new records. The aggregates business achieved all-time record revenues in 2023, growing 10.9% to $4.3 billion. Gross profit increased 40.1% to $1.4 billion, and gross margin increased 660 basis points to 32%.', 'Again, both all-time records. Solid pricing growth more than offset lower shipments, further demonstrating how the disciplined execution of our value over volume, commercial strategy yields, higher profits and higher margins even without the benefit of growing volumes. Our Texas Cement business extended its track record of outstanding performance and once again delivered record top and bottom-line results. Revenues increased 17% to $725.5 million and gross profit increased 64.6% to $333.6 million, driven primarily by favorable supply/demand dynamics in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex and energy cost tailwinds. As a reminder, the new finish mill at our Midlothian, Texas plant in North Texas is expected to be fully operational in the third quarter of 2024, adding approximately 450,000 tons of incremental high margin annual production capacity.', 'Moving to our targeted downstream businesses. Our concrete revenues increased 5.9% to $1 billion and gross profit increased 44.2% to $102 million, driven primarily by pricing gains and mega project contributions, which more than offset higher upstream, raw material, and delivery costs. Asphalt and paving revenues increased 12.6% to $887.1 million. Gross profit increased 34.7% to $109 million. The result of strong demand and lower bitumen costs. Magnesia Specialties full year revenues increased 3.8% to $315.4 million, while gross profit increased 6.9% to $97.1 million. Strong pricing and energy cost tailwinds more than offset weaker demand in certain magnesia end markets, including TPO roofing and cobalt mining. We continue to balance our long-standing disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business.', ""In 2023, we invested $650 million of capital into our business and returned $324 million to shareholders through both an increased dividend and share repurchases. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February of 2015, we have returned a total of $2.6 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.4 times as of December 31st, assuming the Albert Frei & Sons and Bluewater Industries' acquisitions and South Texas Cement and related concrete operations divestiture were effective as of January 1st, 2024, after giving effect to the impacts of these transactions, our net debt to EBITDA ratio would have been 1.85 times, just below our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times, which would provide ample dry powder to take advantage of additional value-enhancing acquisitions."", ""With that, I'll turn the call back to Ward to discuss end market trends."", ""Ward Nye: Jim, thanks so much. We're enthusiastic about Martin Marietta's prospects in 2024 and beyond. We anticipate healthy demand in public and heavy non-residential construction will largely offset softness in the residential sector and expected moderation in light non-residential construction. However, anticipated decreases in mortgage rates should provide tailwinds in residential demand and an uptick in single-family home construction as evidenced by recent [Indiscernible] data. As you've heard us say for years in this business, where you are matters and Martin Marietta is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these long-term secular trends. Infrastructure activity is expected to remain resilient as funds from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, along with record State Department of Transportation or DOT budgets, as well as voter-approved state and local transportation-related ballot initiatives coalesce to per years of steady investment and demand."", ""The value of state and local government highway, bridge, and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand, grew 8% to $113 billion in 2023. According to the American Road & Transportation Builders Association or ARPA, Texas, Colorado, California, Georgia, and Florida, key Martin Marietta states are among some of the largest growing markets based on contract awards. Importantly, our investment in our nation's infrastructure continues to maintain broad bipartisan support. During the November 2023 election, voters approved 88% of transportation-related state and local ballot initiatives, representing approximately $7 billion of additional infrastructure funding. We expect this enhanced level of federal, state, and local infrastructure investment will yield steady, multiyear demand in this important aggregates-intensive often countercyclical end market."", 'Moving to non-residential and starting with heavy industrial, strong demand for large manufacturing and heavy side energy projects is expected to counterbalance ongoing moderation in warehouse and data center construction from its COVID peak. Construction spending from manufacturing in the United States continues to trend positively with the December seasonally adjusted annual rate of spending for 2023 at $214 billion, a 61% increase from the December 2022 value of $133 billion. Manufacturing projects continue to be supported by health demand from the ongoing reshoring of critical product supply chains, including semiconductors and electric vehicle battery manufacturing. As an example, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Toyota announced an $8 billion expansion to their battery manufacturing campus in North Carolina, bringing their total investment to approximately $14 billion.', ""This incremental investment solidifies North Carolina is Toyota's central hub for lithium-ion battery production in North America with this campus having over 7 million square feet. Importantly, our quarries are well-positioned to supply the aggregates needs for this type of multiyear project. Shifting to light non-residential, while demand remained resilient through 2023 despite higher interest rates, high office vacancy rates, and tighter commercial lending additions, we expect 2024 demand in this segment to moderate as it generally follows single-family residential development with a lag. Given the structural housing deficit and favorable population trends in key Martin Marietta markets, we fully expect the affordability-driven single-family residential slowdown will recover as interest rates declined further and monthly mortgage payments become relatively more affordable."", ""Although there's still near-term uncertainty, we're encouraged by recent trends in single-family housing starts, a leading indicator of aggregate demand, which were 1 million units in December, an increase of 16% from a year ago. Looking ahead, we expect 2024 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. As previously mentioned, we anticipate flat aggregate shipments as infrastructure and large-scale non-residential projects should largely offset softness in the residential and light non-residential sectors. With steady product demand, supporting favorable commercial dynamics and the disciplined execution of our value over volume strategy, we expect double-digit aggregates pricing growth to overcome inflationary pressures and lead to expanded gross margins and unit profitability growth."", ""Combined with contributions from our cement, downstream and Magnesia Specialties businesses and contributions from our recently acquired Colorado assets, we are confident in our expectations for consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $2.24 billion at the midpoint. To conclude, we're extremely proud of our record-setting performance in 2023. We demonstrated our ability to successfully navigate another challenging macroeconomic environment and deliver superior returns for shareholders.

It allows clinicians to track metrics, including a patient’s range of motion, step count and walking speed for up to 10 years.\xa0', 'The device has been in a limited market release, but Zimmer CEO Ivan Tornos said in a recent earnings call that the company will enter a full launch this year.', 'Canary has also been working on a separate acoustic sensor for heart failure patients. The company recently completed a two-person feasibility trial of the implanted device, which Canary is developing to help patients and clinicians better manage congestive heart failure symptoms with medication.', 'MedTech Dive caught up with Canary CEO Bill Hunter to talk about progress with Persona IQ and other devices the company is developing.', 'This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\xa0', 'BILL HUNTER: When we launched the product, it was certainly an interesting idea, and it was something that there was a lot of excitement around, but the reality is that when we first started collecting data there was no context.', ""The questions everybody wanted to know — “Is this normal, abnormal, good, bad?” — we didn't have the answer for because we didn't have enough patients. And just as importantly, it takes a patient a year to recover from a total knee replacement, and we didn't have one year of data to follow the entire patient journey. The first year and a quarter was really just about getting our bearings."", 'Nobody knew what a normal step count was on day five or what a normal range of motion was on day 12. We needed sufficient patients to be able to say, this is average, this is good, this is bad. And we needed enough time to pass to document the entire patient journey.', 'It was the beginning of Q2 2023 when we had enough knowledge to start to provide some clinical benefit.\xa0', 'Exactly. As we had gone into the fall, we had a couple of fairly significant users. We had one practice that has probably put in close to 1,000. We had another high-volume practice that was using quite a few every week. Now, we were starting to get a better understanding of what I would call the patient management aspect of it.\xa0', ""We learned that yes, the surgeon decides whether or not they want to put in a smart knee, but it's really the care team that has to take that data, look at the data, provide the patient with feedback, and potentially change the care pathway one way or another, depending on what they see. And that's a multi-step process.\xa0"", ""It's not one of those things where you take a look at it for the first time and presto, it all makes sense.\xa0"", ""We have practices that are moving to what I would call a virtual-first model. If they look at the one-month, two-month, three-month data and the patient is excelling, they contact that patient. And if the patient says “Yeah, I'm feeling great,” they stay on a virtual model. They don't bring them back for the three-month, the six-month and the 12-month visit.\xa0"", ""You want to make sure that you're still being reimbursed for doing all that follow-up. So, there's that incorporated on the billing side. On the other hand, if you're not doing well, and your activity metrics, your range of motion is poor, they don't necessarily wait until the three-month visit anymore. They may bring those patients back earlier and try and increase the physical therapy, increase the activity, maybe implement a little bit of home care to try and get things moving before the patient ends up with an operating condition.\xa0"", 'Our vision of the business was not really to be a classic medtech manufacturer. Our vision of business was to harvest very unique data from inside the medical devices that patients use and then use that data to augment clinical practice. With Zimmer, the next step is to go into hips and shoulders. Zimmer plans to have a smart option for their entire implant portfolio.\xa0', ""We are working on a spinal implant for interbody cages. That's getting closer to a partnership and a normal development plan.\xa0"", ""Our first cardiac monitor will go into patients this month, actually. Our belief is five, 10 years from now, most major medical devices will provide some sort of feedback to help clinicians understand what's going on at the site of injury."", ""We're developing that on our own. It's different than what we do in spine and orthopedics. It's not physically attached to the device. It's a small implant that goes over the chest wall, just like a pacemaker battery would, and it's designed to look at physiology. It's designed to look at the valvular function. It's designed to look at stenosis in the coronary arteries. It's designed to look at fluid levels in the lungs."", ""Just that type of thing could certainly allow an easier ability to titrate medications, blood pressure medications, diuretics, things like that. It's geared more towards chronic management of cardiac patients."", 'This one is a lot easier for us. Our knee is cemented in place, so we designed the battery and the sampling algorithm to last for 20 years because we only get one shot of putting the battery in. With a percutaneous approach, you can replace the battery, just like we do with pacemakers. Most of the batteries we would use would probably give us two to three years of continuous monitoring. When that ran out, you could go back and replenish it.', 'This story was originally published on MedTech Dive.

It's not a fully integrated energy company like Exxon or Chevron since it doesn't operate refineries. However, it's not a pure-play independent producer, either, since it has three other business segments (chemicals, midstream, and lower carbon)."", ""That diversification paid off in 2023 as the company's chemicals segment had a strong year. It showcases the company's differentiated strategy, which will become a more apparent growth catalyst in the coming years. "", 'Occidental Petroleum recently reported its fourth-quarter and full-year results and ended last year on a strong note. Its production averaged over 1.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) and exceeded the midpoint of its guidance range, despite a third-party outage in the Gulf of Mexico. It also was its highest quarterly total in more than three years. This strong operational performance helped fuel solid operating cash flow of $3.2 billion and $1.1 billion in free cash flow in the period. ', ""The company's oil and gas segment is its biggest moneymaker. Occidental reported $6.2 billion of income from oil and gas production last year (80% of its total segment earnings). "", ""However, there's a downside to having so much exposure to volatile commodity prices. Due to lower prices last year, Occidental's oil and gas earnings were more than 50% below 2022's total. "", ""While the company's oil and gas segment had a down year, its chemicals segment had a very strong one. That business generated over $1.5 billion in reported income, nearly tied for its second-best year. While this segment's earnings were also down from their peak in 2022 due to lower commodity prices, it helps provide the energy company with some earnings diversification while enhancing its growth profile. "", ""Oil and gas production will continue to be the most meaningful contributor to Occidental's earnings and cash flow in the near term. That's especially true after the company agreed to buy fellow oil and gas producer CrownRock for $12 billion. That deal will increase the company's production by 170,000 BOE/d while boosting its free cash flow by $1 billion in the first year (assuming oil averages $70 per barrel). "", ""However, oil and gas aren't the company's only growth drivers. Occidental is also investing heavily to expand its chemical operations."", 'The company spent $230 million on capital projects last year and anticipates investing another $450 million this year and $425 million in the 2025 to 2026 time frame. These investments to modernize and expand its plants will increase its cash flow through improved margins and higher product volumes. ', 'Occidental anticipates an annual earnings uplift of $300 million to $400 million starting in 2026 as it completes its current slate of projects. That should make its chemicals business an even more important future contributor. ', ""On top of that, the company is building a low-carbon energy platform. It's currently constructing its Stratos direct air capture (DAC) project in the Permian Basin, which should begin commercial operations in the middle of next year. It secured Blackrock as its joint venture partner on the project, which will capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. "", 'Occidental also closed its acquisition of Carbon Engineering, the company behind the DAC technology. That deal will enhance its ability to develop additional DAC facilities, which should drive earnings and cash-flow growth as they come online. Occidental believes it could eventually make as much money by providing decarbonization services as it currently earns from producing oil and gas. ', 'While Occidental Petroleum currently makes the majority of its money producing oil and gas, that might not be the case in the future. The company is investing heavily to grow its already meaningful chemicals business and build a lower carbon energy platform. ', ""These investments should start accelerating the company's earnings growth over the next few years.

I'm going to start by discussing our financial performance, operational excellence, and our strategic advancements in 2023, then I'll review our capital plans for 2024. These continue to position us to deliver sustainable and growing returns for our shareholders through our premier asset portfolio, advanced technology, and robust commercial runway."", ""First, I'll begin by reviewing our financial performance in 2023. Last year, our talented and committed teams across the company applied advanced technical expertise, operating skills, leading-edge technologies, and innovation to our exceptional portfolio, and they delivered results for $5.5 billion in free cash flow, which enabled us to pay $600 million of common dividend, repurchased $1.8 billion of common shares, and redeemed $1.5 billion of preferred shares while also investing $6.2 billion back into the business. Next, I'll comment on our operational excellence in 2023. Last year, our production in our global oil and gas business exceeded the midpoint of our original full-year production guidance by 43,000 BOE per day."", 'This was driven by record new well productivity rates across our domestic assets in the Delaware, Midland, and DJ Basins and internationally by record production from Block 9 and Oman. And in addition, we safely completed the expansion of the Al Hosn plant in the UAE, which also delivered record annual production. Despite negative price revisions, well performance across our portfolio enabled us to achieve an all-in reserves replacement ratio of 137% in 2023 and a three-year average ratio of 183%. Our track record from prior years of consistently replacing produced barrels continues and added F&D costs that is below our current DD&A rate.', ""Oxy's year-end 2023 worldwide proved reserves increased to 4.0 billion BOE from 3.8 billion BOE in 2022. OxyChem performed exceptionally well in 2023. It exceeded guidance and achieved $1.5 billion in pre-tax income for the third time in its history, due largely to lower energy costs and an efficient planned turnaround at our Ingleside plant, even as product markets soften compared to 2022. In addition, construction on STRATOS, our first direct air capture facility, is progressing on schedule to be commercially operational in mid-2025."", ""The fourth quarter of 2023 was an exciting way to conclude a successful year. In oil and gas, we delivered our highest quarterly production in over three years and outperformed the midpoint of our production guidance despite a third-party interruption in the Gulf of Mexico. Our Rockies business outperformed in the fourth quarter that's consistent with its year-long trend. Innovative artificial lift technology continued to maximize base production."", ""Well design optimization in the DJ Basin that we presented in our second quarter earnings call contributed to a 32% productivity improvement from 2022. We also continued to deliver robust well performance in the Permian Basin where our Delaware teams drove results to the high end of the Permian's fourth quarter production guidance. Our Top Spot well, which we also discussed in our second quarter earnings call, continued its strong performance trajectory and delivered the highest six-month cumulative production of any horizontal well ever in the New Mexico Delaware Basin. In fact, Oxy has drilled eight of the top 10 horizontal wells of all time across the entire Delaware based on this production metric, and three of those wells came online last year."", 'Since mid-2022, our teams outperformed the Delaware Basin industry average 12-month cumulative oil production by nearly 50%. Our team aims to extend our leadership in the New Mexico Delaware Basin this year. A significant portion of the 2024 Delaware program will develop the same horizon as the record Top Spot well. Further south in the Texas Delaware Basin, our teams continued to deliver success with a couple of notable appraisal wells in the second Bone Spring and third Bone Spring Line.', ""These wells drove incredibly early time volumes and accordingly secured additional capital in our 2024 Delaware program. Our appraisal programs are positioning us for success by adding horizons in the Delaware Basin and moving tier 2 and tier 3 wells to tier 1, but we're also improving our current tier 1 intervals, for example, with our Top Spot well. Outside the Delaware Basin, we're also making strides in some of the basins that we expect will begin to play a more consequential role. In the Midland Basin, technical excellence, including the basin-leading Barnett wells, drove a one-year cumulative improvement in well productivity of over 30% compared to the prior year."", 'In the Powder River Basin, Oxy had one Wyoming state initial production and early cumulative production pad record of 1.5 million barrels of oil produced in only about seven months. As we highlighted, our unconventional technical teams continue to expand and improve inventory across all of U.S. onshore basins. While our subsurface modeling, innovative well designs, and enhanced artificial lift technology have driven improvements in well recovery, new well designs have also resulted in record drilling times for both two- and three-mile Texas Delaware Basin laterals.', 'Similarly in the Powder River Basin, our teams drilled an average 1,650 feet per day, and we drilled a 10,000-foot well in only 11 days, both achieving Oxy basin records. Our successes are not limited to our onshore U.S. portfolio. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we are continuing to leverage technology to drive even stronger production results, and our subsea pumping system on the K2 field achieved first lift four months ahead of schedule.', ""This is Oxy's first deployment of this technology in deep water. We expected to unlock future production enhancement opportunities and longer-distance subsidy tiebacks. Next, I'll shift to discussing how we advanced our strategy last year. In 2023, we hydrated our oil and gas portfolio, launched the expansion of our OxyChem Battleground facility, and announced strategic commercial transactions that we expect will deliver sustainable multiyear value to our shareholders."", 'These steps strengthened our portfolio and make it unique in our industry. We have high-quality, short-cycle, high-return oil and gas shale development in the U.S., along with conventional lower-decline oil and gas development in Permian EOR, the GOM, Oman, Algeria, and Abu Dhabi. These developments are complemented by our strong and stable cash flow from our chemicals business and the cash flow and carbon reduction we expect our low-carbon ventures to provide in the future. In addition to high grading our oil and gas portfolio through organic development and appraisal work last year, we also announced the strategic acquisition of CrownRock which will add high-margin, low breakeven inventory while increasing free cash flow per diluted share.', ""The incremental cash flow will support our cash flow priority of delivering a sustainable and growing dividend, along with deleveraging and share repurchases after reducing the principal debt to $15 billion. We are working constructively with the FTC in its review of the transaction and expect to receive regulatory approval and close in the second half of this year. The capital plan we will review in a moment excludes CrownRock because we'll continue to operate as two separate companies until we obtain regulatory approval and close the acquisition. In our LCV business, we completed many pivotal transactions that provided technology advancement, third-party capital, revenue certainty, and commercial optionality."", ""We closed the acquisition of direct air capture technology innovator Carbon Engineering last quarter. This was a landmark achievement in our direct air capture development path. We're excited also about our STRATOS joint venture with BlackRock, which we believe demonstrates the DAC is becoming an investable asset for world-class financial institutions. In addition, our teams signed on several more flagship carbon dioxide removal credit customers."", ""Now I'd like to reiterate our cash flow priorities and discuss our capital plans for 2024. On our December call, we discussed how we will focus on our cash flow and shareholder return priorities in 2024 on dividend growth, debt reduction, and the capital allocation program that generates strong free cash flow throughout the commodity cycle. As we discussed regarding CrownRock, we intend to complete at least $4.5 billion in debt repayments for both pro forma cash flow and proceeds from a divestiture program. We intend to prioritize debt reduction until we achieve a principal debt balance of $15 billion or below, including repaying debt as it matures."", 'As a result of the acquisition, we expect to strengthen our balance sheet, improve our resilience, and lower commodity price environments, and free up cash from interest payments to support future sustainable dividend growth and share repurchases. Every year, we design our capital plan to support our strategic initiatives via projects that maximize our returns and best position Oxy to deliver long-term and resilient returns to our shareholders. Our 2024 capital plan continues a bifurcated investment approach that balances short-cycle, high-margin investments with measured longer-cycle cash flow growth investments. In 2024, we plan to invest $5.8 billion to $6 billion in our energy and chemicals businesses, resulting in slightly less capital for our unconventional assets this year.', 'However, we expect our unconventional assets to return more cash to the business, and we continue to expect year-over-year production growth and continued success across our premier unconventional portfolio, including some of the emerging horizons. We intend to complement our own conventional exposure with increases to our midcycle investments, including lower-decline conventional reservoirs, which are expected to drive longer-cycle cash flow resiliency. Our 2024 midcycle capital investments will position us to continue the exciting projects that we started last year. Investments in OxyChem are expected to increase this year as progress continues on the Battleground expansion and the plant enhancement project.', ""We also added a second drillship in the Gulf of Mexico to support what we believe could become a future growth asset for Oxy. Lower-decline oil production from our enhanced oil recovery, or EOR, is an important part of our long-term strategy. This year, we're investing in gas processing expansions for our Permian EOR business that support longer-term growth and many of our core CO2 fulfills. Our EOR business will continue to be a key part of our future oil and gas development as we believe that carbon dioxide captured by direct air capture facilities is a sustainable way to develop the 2 billion barrels of potentially recoverable oil remaining in our Permian EOR operations."", ""In our emerging low-carbon businesses, much of Oxy's planned $600 million 2024 investment will be directed to STRATOS. We have also allocated capital to continue preparations for a second direct air capture and sequestration hub in South Texas, along with subsurface and well-permitting investments needed at our Gulf Coast sequestration hubs. Capital received from financial partners for our LCV businesses will add to our $600 million investment. This includes capital contributions from our joint venture partner BlackRock for STRATOS."", ""BlackRock's investment totaled $100 million in 2023, and we expect that figure will increase in 2024. We're making great progress toward advancing our net-zero pathway as we develop direct air capture and other exciting technologies. We see tremendous potential in LCV to increase Oxy's cash flow resilience and generate solid, long-term returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Sunil for a review of our fourth quarter financial results and 2024 guidance."", 'Sunil Mathew -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you, Vicki. I will begin today by reviewing our fourth quarter results. We announced an adjusted profit of $0.74 per diluted share and a reported profit of $1.08 per diluted share with the difference between adjusted and reported profit, primarily driven by the after-tax fair value gain related to the acquisition of Carbon Engineering. Our teams exceeded the midpoint of guidance across all three business segments during the fourth quarter, and we delivered outstanding operational performance.', 'Higher-than-expected production in our domestic onshore and international assets enabled us to overcome production losses caused by an unplanned third-party outage in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. This outage led to a lower-than-expected companywide oil cut and a higher-than-anticipated domestic operating cost per BOE. It is also expected to impact production into early next month and is reflected in the guidance that I will soon cover. We had a positive working capital change, primarily due to receipt of the environmental remediation settlement, timing of semiannual interest payments on debt, and decreases in commodity prices.', ""We exited the quarter with over $1.4 billion of unrestricted cash. Turning now to guidance. Last month, Oxy and CrownRock each received a request from the FTC for additional information related to the acquisition. The FTC's request for additional information will impact the timing of closing, which we expect to occur in the second half of the year."", ""Oxy will receive the benefit of CrownRock's activity between the January 1, 2024, transaction effective date and close, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Additionally, the issuance of senior unsecured notes, funding of the fully committed $4.7 billion term loans, and termination of the existing bridge loan facility are expected to be aligned with the transaction's closing. In 2024, we expect full-year production to average 1.25 million BOE per day, representing low single-digit growth from 2023 with the Rockies and Al Hosn driving production growth. As Vicki mentioned, well design and operational expertise drove production outperformance in the Rockies last year."", ""We anticipate that these results will continue in 2024 with a steady run rate of wells coming online compared to the first quarter of last year when we have recently ramped up rig activity. Permian production is expected to remain largely flat with Permian unconventional capital decreasing by approximately 10% compared to the prior year. Internationally, we anticipate continued higher production at Al Hosn following last year's plant expansion. Total company production guidance in the first quarter reflects a low point for 2024 with a significant step-up expected in the remainder of the year."", ""The expected first quarter decrease in production is primarily driven by the relatively lower activity levels and working interest in the Permian Basin in last year's fourth quarter, January winter storm impacts of approximately 8,000 BOE per day in our domestic onshore assets, annual planned maintenance at Dolphin, and the Gulf of Mexico unplanned downtime event. Domestic operating costs on a BOE basis in 2024 are expected to decrease due to reduced maintenance in the Gulf of Mexico and improved lifting costs in the DJ Basin. Moving on to chemicals, in 2023, OxyChem generated pre-tax income nearly matching its second-highest year ever. This year we are guiding to a midpoint of $1.1 billion of pre-tax income."", ""This year's full-year guidance is close to the fourth best year ever for the chemicals segment despite potential challenging market conditions. We expect that our first quarter OxyChem results will be largely flat from the prior quarter. Our guidance for Q1 reflects the combination of PVC price erosion, largely associated with contract adjustments in Q4, typical seasonal subdued demand in both PVC and caustic, and export pricing pressure on caustic from China. Our guidance assumes that in Q1, we have reached the bottom of the cycle with most stabilized prices."", 'I would like to close today by looking beyond 2024 to highlight several catalysts that we expect will enhance our financial trajectory in the coming years. Our midstream business is well-positioned to benefit from a reduction in crude oil transportation rates from the Permian to the Gulf Coast by the end of the third quarter of 2025. We expect annualized savings from these rate reductions of $300 million to $400 million with approximately 40% of the savings starting in 2025 and the full annual savings anticipated in 2026. The OxyChem Battleground and plant enhancement projects are expected to generate incremental benefits to EBITDA of $300 million to $400 million per year once complete.', ""In combination, these improvements to midstream and chemicals are expected to deliver an incremental annualized run-rate EBITDA of $600 million to $800 million. As Vicki discussed, we also expect the planned midcycle investments in our conventional Gulf of Mexico and Permian EOR assets to provide cash flow resiliency through lower-decline conventional production. As we continue to execute on high grading our premium portfolio, we are committed to meeting our deleveraging targets that I outlined in December. We believe that our strengthened balance sheet and Oxy's premium portfolio will enable future increases to a common dividend and rebalance enterprise value in favor of our common shareholders."", ""Our teams are focused on extending Oxy's track record of operational excellence and solid execution on our path to delivering growing and sustainable shareholder returns over the long term. I will now turn the call back over to Vicki."", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you, Sunil. 2023 was a significant year for Oxy on both operational and commercial fronts. Our teams skillfully navigated through the dynamics, and I want to recognize our employees' ingenuity and hard work. Their efforts generated the exciting achievements we covered today, as well as the great progress that is underway, to position us for a successful 2024."", ""With that, we'd like to open the call for questions. Jordan mentioned earlier that Richard Jackson and Ken Dillon are also on the call, and they will participate in the Q&A session. We'll now take your calls."", '', 'Operator', 'The first question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.', 'Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Thank you so much, and Vicki, great to hear from you. My question is just really around deleveraging and so you talked about this in the opening comments, but just talk about the path to getting balance sheet to where you want to be post the CrownRock acquisition, and how you see the asset sale market playing out here in enabling you to get that debt lower? Thank you.', 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, as you notice, by virtue of all the M&A that's happening, there's a lot of appetite for companies to try to get into the Permian and we do have properties in the Permian that are not core to us but could be core to others and some of it just where they're placed in the Permian geographically and how they're not as cored up as some of our key areas. So the divestitures, I believe, will go well. What we won't do, though, is we've decided not to make any divestitures until we close the CrownRock acquisition and then we'll start a proactive process more aggressively at that point."", 'Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""That's great, Vicki. Thank you. And then on the Gulf of Mexico, the Q1 guide of 107 to 115, but the balance of the year 133 to 141, I'm guessing a lot of that's around the pipeline outage. Can you just give us a sense of what are the gating factors to get that asset back online and how we should be thinking about the cadence of production over the course of the year?"", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. We're leaving the updates on that to the operator and so we're not making any comments on that because we're giving them room to get their business done. With respect to the rest of the year, we expect the rest of the year to continue on as normal and we expect that when we're back up and running, we may get a little bit of flush production from that and we'll have, hopefully, our target date for getting back up and online is pretty close to what we said. Do you have anything to add?"", 'Ken Dillon -- Senior Vice President and President, International Oil and Gas Operations', ""No. It's Ken here. Maybe I can add a couple of things. So we're feeling pretty good about the date, and for example, we're sending our specialist start-up crews offshore tomorrow to finish lining out the facilities for full operations."", 'I think that gives you a feel for where we are in the process. The plants are in great shape. Our operations crews in parallel with the outage carried out our full 2024 turnarounds and also completed our enhancement projects for the year as well. So avoiding outages in 2024 gives us a really good shot.', ""So we're looking forward to it."", 'Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Thank you. Thanks, Ken.', 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'So thank you. Appreciate it, Neil. That was time very well spent. They made use of all the time that they had to do things that we needed to do.', 'Operator', 'The next question is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess the number of course are shrinking, Ken. It's great to hear you on the call after Conoco's latest retirement."", ""So thanks, Vicki, for getting on as well. So I have a couple of questions, if I may. I guess, the first one is, I hate to do it, but I want to come back on the disposal question. I realize you don't want to give a lot of detail, but I want to frame it like this."", ""When you bought Anadarko and you were trying to delever, I seem to recall you had about 25 different packages that were for sale, and of course, you ended up not having to do hardly any of those. I think it was about a dozen or something like that. So it seems to me that you've got a lot of things that you've already scrubbed. So my question is, can you give us some color as to whether there is significant cash flow that would come along with the range of $4.5 billion to $6 billion? Without being specific on assets, what's the associated free cash flow number?"", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, depending on what actually is divested, we can't really give you an estimate of what that is today. Some things are changing in terms of what we're looking at. So I think that it would be very difficult to put the number out there at this point."", 'Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Is it significant? Would you consider it material, Vicki?', 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Anything that's material, we wouldn't likely do. We're trying to minimize the cash flows sold to ensure that we can maintain our cash flow. With that said, there will be some cash flow going because it's hard to sell any assets out here that we haven't already at least done appraisal work on to generate some cash flow."", 'Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""OK. Thank you. My follow-up is on sustaining capital. You've stepped it up a little bit to $3.9 billion."", ""But what we're trying to figure out is this year's growth is about 2%. You're spending $6.5 billion, of which $1 billion is Battleground and DAC, which gets you to about $5.5 billion. So what I'm trying to figure out is, the growth rate of 2% seems to correlate with growth spending of about $1.5 billion. It seems -- the ratio just seems a bit off."", 'Can you help me understand how I should think about that?', 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""So if you look at our -- what we've said we'll spend in oil and gas is $4.8 billion to $5 billion in 2024, that -- part of that will be spent on, as we mentioned, some of the mid-cycle projects that generate oil production at a later date. For example, the Permian EOR, investing in that would generate the oil and gas production from that in about the third year after we started. So that will be a bit delayed. Gulf of Mexico, some of those are also preparing us for the future."", ""So the mid-cycle investments will not impact this year's production. The potentially 2.2% increase will be based on the spending of the $4.9 billion, if you use the mid-cycle price, less than $4.8 billion. And then when you look at what's being spent in our oil and gas operations minus that amount, you still have some of that going for our facilities. I think it speaks well to what the teams have done with respect to productivity and getting more out of the wells that we can actually spend what's really less than half that billion that you mentioned on oil and gas activities and then some of that will be for facilities."", ""So we're actually getting a 2% growth rate from some of what we've developed in 2023, going over to 2024, and then the high productivity that we're getting out of our development."", 'Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""That's a great answer, Vicki. You're still the most capital-efficient portfolio by miles, so thank you so much for the answer."", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""It's really exciting what the teams have done, and thank you for the question."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from John Royall with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.', 'John Royall -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So my first question is on midstream.', ""I think one area that surprised us a bit was the full-year midstream guide. You gave some good color in the slides, kind of bridging from 4Q to 1Q. But just thinking about bridging the full year, how would you characterize the moving pieces from full-year 2023 to full-year 2024? And then maybe what do you think the midstream business can do structurally kind of under mid-cycle conditions, excess $300 million to $400 million savings you've spoken about?"", 'Sunil Mathew -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah. Hi. So one of the main drivers for the relatively lower guidance for this year is an assumption on the spread for the gas transportation contracts. So last year, we captured several gas transportation capacity optimization opportunities.', 'For example, when the cold weather event occurred in the West Coast in the first quarter. So obviously we cannot predict these events, so our guidance assumes compressed gas transportation spreads. But when the market does present itself, we are well-positioned to capture these opportunities. So that is one of the main factors.', ""The other one is in Al Hosn. We've assumed a lower sulfur pricing for 2024 compared to last year. Now, sulfur prices are at a near-term low of around $70 per ton and that is primarily due to weak Asian fertilizer demand and also sale of built-up sulfur inventories by major regional producers. But based on the market trends, we think -- we see a potential improvement in prices during the second half from demand pickup and also unwinding of the sulfur inventory."", 'And the last thing I would say is, we think this is sort of the low point in terms of the midstream income. We have assumed a narrow spread for the gas transportation for this year, and starting next year, we are also going to start getting the benefit of the two transportation contracts expiring, like I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So looking forward, the next three years or four years, you should see a significant uplift in our midstream income.', 'John Royall -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Great. Thanks for the color, Sunil. And then maybe just hoping for a little bit of detail on the $700 million BOE of additions to reserves. It's a pretty big number, especially when considering you're adding an acquisition this year."", ""So maybe just some color on the sources of those additions and where they're coming from."", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'I think the bulk of the additions were from our Permian Resources business. I think the -- I think just essentially most of it was. We had some revisions from productivity improvements in other areas, but the bulk was from Permian EOR, where I think, Richard, if you look at your reserve replacement ratio just for onshore, that was pretty significant.', 'Richard Jackson -- President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management', ""Yeah. I mean, just to add to that, I mean, obviously, the focus, while near-term, some of these highlights that we're putting in on the primary benches that we've been developing, driving the outperformance on production. But some of the highlights we've been trying to put in the call are some of these secondary benches that are becoming more prevalent in our program. If you look at some of those highlights, so that second Bone Spring or the Bone Spring line, you look at that Delaware chart that we've got on cumu production highlighting the year-on-year performance in the Delaware, those secondary benches are outperforming our 2023 average."", ""And so those -- as we delineate and develop more of those, that's really driving that reserves in the unconventional. EOR continues to do well. Talk in more detail if there's interest, but some of the projects they have going on there to increase capacity in some of our gas processing facilities, like in Seminole, which I think we highlighted, these are also giving us near-term, we call it operability or it's really the reliability of that production. So some of that incremental investment this year is driving, say, a couple of thousand barrels a day of improved base production."", ""But that's also providing capacity to develop some of those low development cost barrels that Vicki noted as we're able to bring on this CO2 for the future. So that's sort of how we're thinking about the reserve story and it plays out in near-term outperformance, but the long-term is picking it up on reserves as well."", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""And I would add the other place where we did add significant reserves was Algeria. As a result of the team's work to get all the 18 contracts merged into one and then extended. So that was great work done by the Algeria team to add reserves there. But the thing I'm most proud of is, while the bulk of the reserves came from those two sources, the Permian and Algeria, and a little bit from the DJ, every business unit we have increased reserves, except for Al Hosn, where we had already booked quite a bit of reserves because of the modeling work done there to get that estimate more refined."", 'John Royall -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question -- excuse me, the next question is from David Deckelbaum with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.', 'David Deckelbaum -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', 'Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions today. I just wanted to follow up a little bit.', 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Hi, David.', 'David Deckelbaum -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Just -- thanks. I wanted to follow up a little bit just on that prior conversation around EOR. I guess this is being built out in conjunction with some of the anticipated volumes coming from STRATOS. Can you give us a sense what sort of capacity in terms of production relative to where you're at today? You're intending to build out, or I guess, thought another way."", 'How large do you anticipate the growth rate to be out of the EOR production base over the next five years to 10 years?', 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""I would say that over the next five years to 10 years, it's going to be a significant part of our portfolio development. We have 2 billion barrels of resources remaining to be developed and we believe that as a result of our Direct Air Capture facilities that we ultimately will build to get CO2 out of the atmosphere, it's going to be the most sustainable barrels in the world. It's going to be a resource that the world needs to get to leave 30% or 40% of oil in conventional reservoirs, and 90% of oil in shell reservoirs. It's just not acceptable."", ""And for the United States to continue our energy independence, EOR is going to have to be a part of the equation. Ultimately, we're getting way ahead of the game here to be sure that we're ready because we do believe that the climate transition would not be affordable for the world without EOR being able to produce net zero carbon barrels of oil. So this is a huge part of our strategy and important not only to our shareholders who love value, but to the U.S., and ultimately, to other parts of the world. And for the nearer term, a forecast on what we can do, Richard has some data on that."", 'Richard Jackson -- President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management', ""Yeah. Perfect. I'll tie that. I mean, one of the attributes we really like around the EOR production that we talk about a lot is the lower decline."", ""So as we came through the last several years, especially through the downturn with lower commodity prices, being able to have that flat -- flatter decline, less than 5%, was able to help us maintain a lot of free cash flow. We really started restoration of some of that development last year, and this year as we go forward, we'll have about 60 wells that we'll bring online, which will add about 4,000 barrels a day of new well production. But the benefit of this EOR and we talk about mid-cycle, that doubles next year and triples in the third year. So you really hit your peak production of around 12,000 barrels a day based on that investment today three years from now."", ""The other thing I mentioned shortly, but just to provide a little more color, the Seminole gas plant expansion, that's about 85 million a day that we'll add in terms of capacity for about $40 million. Again, this year we'll expect a couple of thousand barrels a day that we'll add in our base production. So if you think about kind of a cash investment intensity or capital intensity, that's as competitive as we've got in the portfolio. But what it does, to Vicki's point, is we're able to bring on our CO2, anthropogenic CO2 for the future."", ""These are very good return projects. They'll be very competitive in our portfolio, especially given the lower decline. So when we look at just that Seminole, as we look 2024 to 2028, that's another 15,000 barrels a day to 20,000 barrels a day type opportunity for minimal capital. So within sort of the range of capital that we're spending this year in EOR, we're building those sort of wedges with great opportunity to do more as we bring on more CO2."", 'So hopefully that helps tie the short and the long.', 'David Deckelbaum -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', 'I appreciate the details, Richard. Maybe just sticking with the theme as a follow-up, just -- I think you talked a little bit about some spending is in the budget this year for the second DAC facility, I guess, in Kleberg. Is any part of that sort of progression, excuse me, still contingent on conversations with the DOE? And is-are you expecting a resolution around finality of funding and grants this year?', 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""The discussions with the DOE are continuing and going quite well. That -- where we -- the timing of the start of the front-end engineering and design will be dependent on the completion of some of those discussions and then the discussions will continue beyond that on getting prepared for the start of construction. But there is a timeline there that we're working through."", 'Richard Jackson -- President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management', ""Maybe just a couple of details I'll add since you asked the question on that. I mean, a lot of that spend is continuing to build out the subsurface capability for that CO2. Obviously, direct air capture is an anchor for the King Ranch area, but we continue to work on our other Gulf Coast tubs. We've submitted eight Class 6 and are expected to submit another 10 this year."", ""So just kind of giving you a scale of what that type of work has been going there. So it's going really well. I'm really pleased with the development work on that end, and then, obviously, Carbon Engineering, we've been getting to work more and more with, and I'm really happy with the progress that is going through R&D to project work with Ken that will fulfill that development work."", 'David Deckelbaum -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', 'Thank you both.', 'Operator', 'The next question is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.', 'Roger Read -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess I'd like to come back to two things, please, Vicki."", ""First one on the CrownRock, if there's anything you can kind of offer us on what the FTC is asking you for a second request. And I'll just sort of preface with, I understand with some of the more integrated companies, the concern of concentration. I'm a little more surprised in a more upstream-oriented company. So anything you can help us with there?"", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, some of our teams felt like they'd asked for everything. But I can tell you our teams are working diligently to work with the team at the FTC to get them all the answers that they need. So it's -- we're progressing and hope to, as we said, be able to close in the second half of this year."", 'Roger Read -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'So they asked for the moon and everything else?', 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""I didn't -- well, I didn't see the moon on there, but we're not done yet."", 'Roger Read -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Fair enough. All right. The other question I had in terms of the capital efficiencies are obviously coming through in the Permian. The regular, let's call it, still modest growth there."", ""But you're increasing the growth rate during 2024 for the Rockies and other part of it. When we had the follow-up calls yesterday, they said part of it was, building some mid-cycle businesses, maybe some somewhat lower declined businesses. I was just wondering, from a corporate structure, how you make the decision on where to allocate the growth capital here, like, why lean more into the Rockies and the EOR rather than the Permian when we're kind of all conditioned to thinking of the Permian as among the best returns in the business, and obviously, the performance you've been delivering at the wellhead kind of says, well, why not more capital in the Permian rather than these other opportunities?"", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, when you look at it on a corporate level, what we're really trying to do is balance our investments over time so that we can have a sustainable growing dividend. And it's -- we've got this unique balance that I think makes it for us different than many other companies and we want to take full advantage of it. And I want to let Richard and Sunil chime in on their views on it, because this is a critical part of what differentiates us."", 'Richard Jackson -- President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management', ""Yeah. No. Roger, appreciate the opportunity. I mean, obviously, we're putting together short-term with long-term in mind and the CrownRock acquisition provides a lot of growth and we've talked about the positive attributes of that being a more mature unconventional development with high margin, 35% decline."", ""It immediately adds. You can think about it from a growth standpoint, a really nice growth wedge this year, both from a free cash flow basis, but also a decline basis. The Rockies, I'll just pick on one point there, about 40% of that capital in the Rockies this year has to do with drilled uncompleted wells that carried in from last year, sort of the cadence of that activity levels, we had resumed activity last year, got ahead on the drilling and then this year really beginning to complete a lot of those wells. So from a capital intensity standpoint, that's very, very low when you look at what we're spending for the amount of production that we're able to add there."", ""Obviously, that's -- we have high margins in the Rockies. We have royalties. There's other things that drive very competitive returns there. And so, that duck count, just as a data point, will kind of go from, say, mid-60s, kind of the fourth quarter of last year to more like mid-30s as we balance and that's allowing us to then actually pull back about a half of a net rig in the Rockies to more of a sustainable activity level."", ""So just a little color on the Rockies so we don't read too much into just one year. But maybe Sunil can then pick that up and talk kind of across the company."", 'Sunil Mathew -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So when we think about capital allocation in the oil and gas segment, what we're trying to do is we're trying to balance between margin, base decline, and capital flexibility. So if you start with cash margin, we start with the U.S. unconventional with high margin, high returns, and based on everything we've heard so far, it's getting better each year."", ""And then you have Gulf of Mexico, which has one of the highest cash margin in our portfolio. And if you look on an incremental basis, it's even higher because a large part of the operating cost is fixed. And then you have international assets, which are mostly production scheduling conflicts, where we get a higher share of production at lower prices and this helps mitigate some of the commodity price risk and protect the overall cash margin. So that is from a margin point of view."", ""And when you think about base decline, so today our production, approximately 60% of our production is unconventional and with CrownRock it's going to get to around 65%. So what we are trying to do is balance between the short-cycle, high-end decline, and conventional, and then the mid-cycle, shallower decline, conventional investments. And Permian EOR, like Richard said, has one of the lowest base decline in our portfolio. So if you look at a typical Permian EOR project, we get to the peak production by the third year and the peak production is almost three times the first year production and then after that, it is a shallow decline."", 'So what this does is, it helps manage our overall corporate decline, which helps with the sustaining capital and which ultimately helps with the break-even. And the third part of it is capital flexibility. So if you look at our capex, even for this year, around 75% of upstream capex is U.S. onshore, where we have flexibility to change activity depending on the macro conditions.', 'So like if you look back in 2020, in U.S. onshore, we had around 30% of the rigs that we planned to operate this year. So we were able to wrap up quickly and efficiently and we can do this if the macro demands that. So these are the three attributes that we look at when we look at oil and gas capital allocation.', 'So to summarize, what I would say is we have a diverse portfolio of both conventional and unconventional assets that helps manage our base decline, while also maximizing our returns and also providing the flexibility to respond to different macro conditions.', 'Roger Read -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'That was very thorough. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question is from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.', 'Neal Dingmann -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', ""Thanks for your time, Vicki and team. My first question, Vicki, is on the DJ. I'm just wondering, could you remind me where you all sit, I think, in good shape? I'm just wondering where you all sit on total permit pertaining to your DJ DNC plan, and then while early, are you all concerned about the, I saw some latest potential proposed Colorado Bills?"", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. I'll pass that to Richard."", 'Richard Jackson -- President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management', ""Yeah. I think just from a permit standpoint. It's been very productive over the last couple of years. So we stand today about a little over a rig year or 1.5 times kind of our current activity."", ""But in the last six months, we've gotten 155 through. In the next 12 months, we expect another 169. So there's some big ones that we've been working through kind of from a larger package standpoint that have gone really well. That team there, and I hope this helps kind of second part of your question, we continue to drop things that are important to the communities and the state around emissions."", ""Our safety programs are very good. We've worked on consolidating facilities and doing things around transportation to make it easier and so a lot of those things have been really the positive things we've been able to add into these permit or development plans around the permits that we've received very positive comments on. So we're continuing on. Again, we're sort of hitting more stable, sustainable activity up there and we feel like we're as good a position as we have been in a long time in terms of permit outflow."", 'Neal Dingmann -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', ""Very helpful, Richard. And then just a follow-up on charitable return and M&A. I'm just wondering, I assume now that the preferred redemptions would now not incur until late 2025. So is it fair to assume that when you were looking at the CrownRock acquisition that you factored in that any CrownRock incremental production or free cash flow would more than offset any mitigated payments now for another year or so?"", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. That's what we figured on that. But the CrownRock does that acquisition. Once we get our debt back down to $15 billion, that's going to be a key part of helping us then to start the resumption of a more robust share of purchase program of both the common and ultimately the preferred."", 'Neal Dingmann -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', 'Great point. Thanks, Vicki.', 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question is from Josh Silverstein with UBS. Please go ahead.', 'Josh Silverstein -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I was going to ask on kind of similar topic there.', ""Now that the asset sales are pushed out and you don't have the term loan coming in just yet, is the shareholder return profile just the base dividends this year and that kind of supports you getting to that $15 billion debt number a bit faster?"", 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""No. Actually, we would -- we're going to accumulate cash flow as we continue to work toward closing the CrownRock deal because a part of cash flow will be used to help pay down both the term loan and our debt maturities that are coming. So cash flow would not be used for share repurchases until we get to the point where we've achieved those goals."", 'Josh Silverstein -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Got it. And then I saw that the Battleground project was pushed out to 2026. If you could just go through any sort of the drivers of the extra time that was needed and what the status of the other plant enhancement projects look like and maybe what the spread of that $350 million EBITDA uplift was, like, kind of between Battleground and the other projects? Thanks.', 'Vicki Hollub -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""I think, there is -- the projects there were pushed out a bit just like many other things because of supply chain issues and also dealing a little bit with inflation. But those projects, we started those, and those are in progress and going well at this point.So I'd like to say that, though, the importance of when those cash flows come on from the plant enhancement projects, we're already starting to see cash flow from those projects. The actual cash flow that we'll see from the Battleground expansion won't be until the second half of 2026.But the exciting thing about all of this is that, when you add the OxyChem projects, which will deliver the $300 billion to $400 billion, the full uplift by the second half of 2026, that's both the plant enhancement projects and the expansion. So we've got that and you combine that with what Sunil had talked about earlier where we have a $400 million reduction in our mid-cycle contract prices in 2025."", ""We'll see the full uplift of that in 2026 as well. And so when you combine those, along with the $1 point -- $1 billion that we expect, assuming a WTI price of $70, that puts us in 2026 with $1.7 billion incremental cash at least and potentially more than that. So to be able to get to a point where, in just a little over two years, where we have through these projects and cost reduction, we are $1.7 billion better in terms of cash flow, that's pretty significant for us and something that we're really looking forward to and excited about."", 'Josh Silverstein -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks, Vicki.', 'Operator', 'The next question is from Michael Scialla with Stephens. Please go ahead.', 'Michael Scialla -- Stephens, Inc. -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Hello. I appreciate all the detail you gave on the decision to direct more capital this year to mid-cycle investments. I wanted to ask specifically about the Gulf of Mexico, which is part of that.', ""Back in December, you were planning on just the two drillships. So I wanted to see what change you're thinking there to add a third drillship and especially given that services there seem to be tighter than they are onshore. Was it just part of this whole mid-cycle investment thesis or is there something else? Can you talk about specifically what you're seeing there that that third drillship will be targeting?"", 'Ken Dillon -- Senior Vice President and President, International Oil and Gas Operations', ""In terms of drillships, we're only planning on two drillships this year. In terms of GOM overall and how it plays into the portfolio, last time I mentioned our GOM 2.0 project. Based on that, we're carrying out detailed reservoir characterization work and can see significant upside potential in the GOM assets. I mentioned water floods, stimulation, horizontals, artificial lift, and subsea pumping, which is already operational for us."", 'If I talk a little bit about water injection, when you already operate fields with original oil in place numbers of billions of barrels, adding water injection is a really economical way of increasing recovery factors on high margin, low development cost barrels. Typical improvements in recovery and appropriate reservoirs can be between 10% and 16%, while also significantly reducing declines, so it plays into the things that Richard was talking about in EOR. The scale of these developments and the very low development costs lead to good returns. Analogs have been highly successful in GOM.', ""As you know, we're world leaders in these technologies. We do them in every country that we operate in, and domestic is the foundation of who we are. I'd also like to highlight the OBN seismic activity that we've done since 2020. That's really helped define these targets, the scale of them and it's assisting in the well planning and well locations that we're working on at the moment."", 'I think we see GOM as a portfolio now, with great optionality to grow using the existing infrastructure that we have in place, but also the technology skills that we have across the entire company. I hope that answers your question.', 'Michael Scialla -- Stephens, Inc. -- Analyst', 'Yeah. It does. Appreciate that, Ken. I know on your CrownRock acquisition call, you mentioned, I think Richard mentioned EOR pilot.', ""You've been working on the Midland Basin for a couple of years.

But the four pilots that we conducted in the Midland Basin were on the South Curtis Ranch, which is not too far from some of those assets. So we do believe that the Midland Basin is going to be one of the areas that we would target in a big way with an enhanced oil recovery development that's using anthropogenic or atmospheric. But we're also doing the same thing in the Delaware Basin now."", 'We have a pilot going on there that will help us to potentially look at that as another place to develop ultimately.

So walk us through what this shale 4.0 season looks like when you have these mergers continuing to come into play."", 'MATTHEW BERNSTEIN: Yeah. Thank you. Happy to be here. So yeah, kind of as you alluded to there, we really do see this as a new era in the shale sector. I think over the past several years, since right before COVID, these operators have been able to prove that they can, essentially, live within their means or invest into new development within their cash flow.', ""So from the investor side and the shareholder side, you're seeing a bit more easiness and a bit more acceptance of things like taking on new debt in order to finance acquisitions, because, ultimately, this shale 4.0 era will really be defined by the need for scale for the long-term. And that's really the motivation behind all these deals is really needing to scale up in terms of the acreage and the amount of drillable locations that you can have for the future, because, ultimately, this is a finite resource."", 'And there is a general consensus on oil demand, at least moving forward, for the next decade. So in shale 4.0, these companies are going to want to have the most scale in the most commercial areas. And, really, that is the core of the Permian Basin.', 'RACHELLE AKUFFO: And speaking of Diamondback and Endeavor, the Permian Basin, one of the most lucrative oil producing regions here. How much does that change the space here?', ""MATTHEW BERNSTEIN: Yeah, certainly. So there's not a lot of companies out there left the same size as Endeavor in terms of the amount of future locations that Diamondback's acquiring in that deal. So, really, you're creating a company, this new Diamondback Endeavor-merged firm, that is right up there in that top upper echelon of inventory holders in the basin."", ""So moving forward, you're going to see more and more of that region consolidated by just a few names. And it's also going to change the nature of the types of deals that we see in the Permian. As I said, there's not a lot of large private targets out there left. There are a few, but what we expect to see in the next phase is potentially some more public to public mergers of equals in order to build scale that way."", 'RACHELLE AKUFFO: And which are some of the oil companies that you think could be next, ripe for this M&A activity?', 'MATTHEW BERNSTEIN: Yeah. So several operators have, effectively, grown very quickly and organically in early-2023 prior to the Exxon Pioneer deal. So that includes some names like Civitas Resources, Vital Energy, Ovintiv, Permian Resources. And these operators were able to acquire private operators that were kind of bundled up by large private equity groups and then who were looking to exit that investment.', 'So I think as a lot of these companies that I mentioned look to gain scale in organically in the Permian during 2023, I think that some of those names could be ripe either to be acquired by a larger company that, perhaps, has stayed out of the dealmaking so far, or, potentially, merge together and create a formidably-sized company in that regard.', ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: And what do you think could be some of the headwinds that we could see when it comes to the energy M&A space here? Because, obviously, we've seen a lot of criticism here for some of these big mergers-- not so much seeing that, though, in the energy space."", 'MATTHEW BERNSTEIN: Yeah. If you look at it, obviously, the Permian Basin is the most productive and, really, the most economic region within the US onshore oil fields. That said, there are still many other areas of very economic oil production. You have the DJ basin in Colorado, the Bakken shale in North Dakota, the Eagleford shale in East Texas.', ""So while a lot of the activity for economic reasons is centered in the Permian Basin, these deals aren't necessarily, I'd say, consolidating a tremendous share of the entire US oil output in the hands of a few operators."", 'RACHELLE AKUFFO: Certainly important context to add there.

Moreover, the company's CF products share active pharmaceutical ingredients, meaning safety issues with one product could adversely affect others."", ""Market Acceptance Uncertainties: Despite the clinical benefits of VRTX's products, market acceptance is not guaranteed.

Tim, where is the caffeine meter checking in?"", ""Tim Beyers: It's all about survival today, Dylan. It's all about survival."", ""Dylan Lewis: [laughs] I hope that the rest of your day goes better than the way it started, but I do love that you are fully caffeinated and ready to go. We've got some huge names in the digital economy posting some big time results, and we're going to stop to smell the roses on a Valentine's Day stock. Tim, we're going to start with Uber because it is the end of an era at Uber. The company reported its Q4 results and its first ever full year profit. Important to note that while it did post 1.4 billion in net income, a billion of that was the investment income, but Tim, we had a legitimate operating income for a full year from Uber."", ""Tim Beyers: It's impressive. I have to give credit where it's due. There are some growth investors who saw this early on. We did make this a rerec in Rule Breakers about, I'm going to say, a little more than a year ago, but part of that was because of work done by others. I'll single out Henry Ellenbogen at Durable Capital, who was early on seeing just how good Uber was tracking. I've just a couple of numbers here, Dylan. There was a thesis for Uber that if they could start generating real meaningful gains in gross bookings. I'm not a big fan of adjusting anything, but management does get paid on what's called adjusted EBITDA. A lot of their incentives are tied to that. For those who don't know what EBITDA is, it's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, so think of it as earnings before really everything that matters."", 'Dylan Lewis: [laughs]', ""Tim Beyers: There's a real caveat here. When management tells you how they're going to get paid, you can expect them to focus on doing the things that are going to get them paid, and Dylan, they are doing the things that get them paid. Gross bookings were up 22% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was up to $1.3 billion during the quarter. That is up a full $618 million year-over-year, so not quite a double but very close to that. Their adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of gross bookings, in other words, getting leverage off of all of that business that's done on the Uber platform, that rose to 3.4%, which was up from 2.2%, so it's not right, even though Uber has been fairly criticized in the past of being a business that gets a lot of artificial sweetener and benefits from a ton of artificial sweetener, that is less and less true. In fact, I'd say for this fiscal year, Dylan, it really isn't true anymore. That's not what Uber is anymore."", ""Dylan Lewis: Tim, I was going to say Uber is like the poster child for adjusted results or has been for so much of its time as a business. You go back to 2016 all the way through to the first quarter of 2023, Uber collectively racked up close to 30 billion in operating losses, so a lot of what they were trying to get people to focus on were those adjusted numbers. I think even as we dive into this result and start looking at some of the elements that would lead to those adjustments, we're seeing positive signs, specifically, looking at things like stock based compensation."", ""Tim Beyers: When we look at SBC, so that is money that's paid out to employees in the form of stock. It's a non-cash expense, and that's been going down, not up. Uber, early in its life, did fund a lot of its more expensive endeavors by hiring very talented employees and giving them a lot of stock and deferring what would be legitimate expenses they have to pay in cash. That is, it's less of an issue now, Dylan. When we look at the cash flow statement here just year-over-year, in the fourth quarter here, stock-based compensation expense was 469 million. That would be a lot. It is a lot, but that's down from 482 million, in 2023, full on 1.9 billion, so yeah, that is a lot, and it's up a little bit from 1.8 billion. I'm rounding up here. If we really want to be specific, it's 1.94 billion versus 1.79 billion, but overall, I can't say this enough here, overall cash from operating activities. Note that I said the stock-based compensation for the full year is up, let's say, about 130 million. You know how much overall cash from operations was up during the fiscal year? It was up almost $3 billion, Dylan, so you can't say that it's just the artificial sweetener that is coming in and saving Uber. It's just not true. It's becoming a more efficient business. Trips are up, bookings are up, the core business, mobility was up 29% in the fourth quarter here. There are areas of the business that aren't holding up their end of the bargain. Freight was down 17% during the quarter, so it's not a perfect business, but the business is getting better and materially so."", ""Dylan Lewis: It feels like a great time to check in because we have these updated earnings results and because after the earnings response, stock is at an all time high. We are looking at Uber at $140 billion market cap. At this point, main competitor Lyft, a footnote at $5 billion It's hard to believe, Tim. How are you feeling about the business right now?"", ""Tim Beyers: I'm feeling pretty good about it. I'm not sure that I love the valuation here, Dylan, just because it is so massive. Having said that, this does happen from time to time where you have a company that has essentially taken a giant foot and stamped their primary competitor, and that is what's happened here. Uber is sucking the oxygen out of the room, and increasingly, they are taking the lion's share of the dollar spent on last mile logistics. As that pie grows, what we're really counting on is that there becomes a bigger demand overall for last mile logistics, delivery in its various forms and not just ride-sharing for people, delivery of groceries, delivery of other items, flowers, other types of convenience, and ultimately, I do think they've got to figure out freight in order to deliver meaningful multi-bagger returns from here. There are questions. The valuation is a little bit rich, but anybody that thinks that buying Lyft here because it's just a fraction of Uber, I think might be deluded."", 'Dylan Lewis: Similar story of industry dominance with Chipotle and restaurants and fast casual after reporting earnings, shares of CMG at all-time highs, Tim, this looks like one of those businesses where everything is working. Pick something, zoom in on it, and the numbers are going to be looking really strong.', ""Tim Beyers: It's pretty amazing. When we were talking off air here, comps, so same store sales up, 8.4%. The expectation was for a 7.1% increase. Think about that for a second. That the street was actually expecting a 7.1% increase, which is a lot, that is a lot for a company as big as Chipotle is right now. Instead, they come in with 8.4%. Just bananas, that's absolutely insane. Overall, Chipotle opened 121 new restaurants during the quarter, 110 locations include a Chipotlane drive-through, and this is something that I think is really interesting, Dylan. What these results tell me is that more and more of the square footage, including the drive-through, is delivering more efficiently for Chipotle. What's fascinating to me, this is a, more specific, industry report on the quarter from an industry trade publication called Restaurant Dive. The idea here is that apparently, Chipotle says they can get to 1,000 Chipotlane, in other words, drive-through versions of their restaurants. They are at 811 units right now and that includes conversions of their existing restaurants. It seems very likely here that what's driving Chipotle is two things, Dylan, first, better usage of the square footage they have for walk-in customers, but also really generating massive increases in order volume through those Chipotlanes. I think this is a business that's really got its mojo right now."", ""Dylan Lewis: I want to put the same question to you that we just discussed in the Uber conversation. Stocks at all time highs, it sounds like you're saying there are some good growth levers, especially with the Chipotlanes and what management has laid out there for the growth plans."", ""Tim Beyers: Yeah. They're not quite halfway to their overall goal of 7,000 restaurants in North America. I would say there's room to grow here, maybe not at the level that it has been growing. I'll just confess personally here, Dylan, that I have a fairly big position in Chipotle. There was a point about, I'm going to say three years ago, where for the individual portfolio it was in, it was a IRA, and it had occupied more than 50% of that IRA, so I sold down half of it. It is now climbing back toward close to half of that portfolio again. It's hard for me to see selling it here because the business is just getting increasingly better. I would not say that the valuation is cheap here. I need to do a little extra work on it, but boy, when you see a company that is executing at the unit level the way that Chipotle is, it's time to pay attention for sure."", ""Dylan Lewis: Tim, I think I speak for everyone when I say, I'm jealous of your problems. [laughs] We're going to wrap with a look at earnings from Roblox. Shares up 8% following the company's results that had better top line growth and narrower losses than expected. Beyond some of the top line numbers, when I look at this business, Tim, I always zoom right in on what we're seeing from the user metrics in particular. That's what makes the business go. It seems like we're seeing some pretty strong trends with those metrics this quarter."", ""Tim Beyers: The thing to pay attention on for Roblox is bookings and bookings for the quarter. We're up 25% year-over-year to 1.13 billion. I'm sorry, that was for the quarter, and for the year, 3.5 billion. That was up 23%. Bookings forecast continued revenue growth just by virtue of the way that people get in and engage with Roblox. For example, they'll spend money and buy additional digital goods, and then that revenue gets recognized over time. The bookings capture the business of the Roblox metaverse, and the revenue is what gets recognized that things get used in the Roblox universe, so you really want to pay attention to bookings here, but there's also, as you point out here, Dylan, really good activity metrics. Average daily active users, now up to 71.5 million. That's up 22% year-over-year, that's for the quarter, and for the full year, 68.4 million also up 22% year-over-year, but here's the really good metric here. I know we're audio here so you can't see me doing this, but if you want to think about how Roblox hockey sticks, there are two things. You want more daily active users. That's one thing that helps push the hockey stick up into the right. The other thing is the average bookings per that daily active user. If the number of users grows, and the amount they spend grows, you start getting up into the right. The average bookings per daily active user was $15.75 in the quarter, and that's up 3% year-over-year. That doesn't sound like a lot, and I get that that does not sound like a lot, but 3% on a vastly growing user base, Dylan, generates a whole lot of momentum. The Big Mo is really with Roblox right now."", ""Dylan Lewis: There are some interesting things in this company's future that I want to check in on. One of them is advertising, Tim. We're in the early innings here with this, and management has said, basically, it's not going to get split out, and it's not going to be something we can look at individually until it is material, but it came up 10 times in the company's earnings call, which to me is saying more and more people are starting to think about this and pay attention to it. How are you looking at it and the way it could potentially help this business?"", ""Tim Beyers: I think there is contextual advertising that really works inside of Roblox. We had things like performances inside Roblox, concerts, things like that. It's not a stretch to see the model of product placement that is so common in TV shows, and you've seen this. You watch your favorite police serial, and they're all using Dell Laptops. Who paid for that, Dylan? We know who paid for that, so product placement inside Roblox is natural. You could see this happening as the number of creative experiences and games multiply inside the Roblox universe. That increases the number of product placement opportunities. You could absolutely see why advertising is an area of discussion for Roblox. The thing that's going to make this better is something that we've yet to see. I need to go through the call to hear how they're doing more of this. The Roblox experience and the value of the platform multiplies when it's easier to create new experiences inside of Roblox. You take somebody who's a casual user of Roblox, maybe plays a game, and you make that person into a creator. One of the ways they want to do that is by automating the creation of experiences with AI. That's something they really care about, so if we have that, and the platform multiplies, and you get an explosion of creativity inside Roblox, one of the happy byproducts of that can be this really interesting advertising revenue stream that surfaces and delivers at a very high margin level, so it's an exciting time. It's a lot still to be worked out, but it is an exciting time."", 'Dylan Lewis: To use a tweak on a famous quote. If you build it, they will come and create and advertise, Tim.', 'Tim Beyers: We hope.', 'Dylan Lewis: We hope. Tim Beyers, thanks for joining me today.', 'Tim Beyers: Thanks, Dylan.', 'Dylan Lewis: Coming up, what would dating profiles look like for stocks? My colleague Mary Long cut up with Motley Fool senior analyst, Asit Sharma, to figure out which companies would make good long-term partners for investors.', ""Mary Long: Asit, Valentine's Day is just around the corner, and we're celebrating on Motley Fool Money with some love-minded episodes over the next few days. To kick that off, thought we'd play a fun little game, like a business-oriented version of The Bachelor, if you will. I have taken the time to scour through the dating profiles of some eligible companies, and I want to talk through them with you and see which out of these four contestants might wind up with a final rose from you, an investor. You ready to play?"", ""Asit Sharma: Mary, I am so ready to play. Love is in the air. Valentine's Day is coming up, and I'm such a picky bachelor. Let's get this show on the road."", ""Mary Long: Let's get this started and see who can win over your investment analyst heart. Our first contestant goes by the name of MicroStrategy, and on the surface, this is your classic tech bro, an enterprise software company that has a Cloud infrastructure business, an analytic segment, and of course, has its hands in AI. That all might sound nice and shiny enough, but there is a catch. MicroStrategy seems to be the person at the table who just can't stop talking about crypto. In 2020, the company made abrupt decision to start hoarding Bitcoin. They've been around since 1989, a legacy software business, so it seems like quite the pivot. How did we get here, Asit?"", ""Asit Sharma: It's a great question. This is one of those partners that you start dating because they look so good, then you get a sense of the personality. How we got here, there was this slow accumulation of cash on MicroStrategy's balance sheet. That is boring. Sorry, I can be a little disparaging here. That's so boring, mid link enterprise business, but they had a steady accumulation of cash flow over the years, and their CEO Michael Saylor started thinking about this cash that was sitting there, and he was also getting a little skeptical of the strength of the US dollar over the long term. A funny thing happened, this was during the pandemic, when all of us were holed up in our houses, on Zoom a lot, watching crazy stuff on the markets, and cryptos among other topics. He started to think, look, there's something here on this long-term store of value story I'm hearing about Bitcoin. The dollar is going to decrease. I think inflation is going to increase. Of course, if we go back to 2020, that was the time of low interest rate. He started subtly talking up in conference calls the fact that that money on the balance sheet was just going to lose its value. He would say it's going to get inflated away, and lo and behold, one day in July of 2020, he tells the analysts on the call, hey, we're looking for some alternative investments. Who wants to put money in the bank? We're looking at silver, gold, and bitcoin. That's how this story started."", ""Mary Long: Apart from this Bitcoin interest, we can make exceptions for the right person. Apart from this massive bitcoin crypto interest, is there promise in MicroStrategy's software business? Can you even separate the company at this point from its Bitcoin holdings?"", ""Asit Sharma: I should say, like any decent software business that has enterprise customers, sure, there's some promise in it, but it has been a very slow growth story. It's stable. A little bit of a boring business. Those who have followed MicroStrategy and Michael Saylor have watched them put all their available cash into Bitcoin, even take on more money, take on debt to buy more Bitcoin, so there's this quasi investment vehicle for people who want to participate in Bitcoin, but don't want to worry about the complexity of holding the asset. When you look at now this business that's got one shoe in Bitcoin and the other and its core revenue stream, it's still easy to separate them out if you look at the financial summary, so you can follow along the operations of the business, but some of this starts to bleed into each other. For example, Michael Saylor has been fond of saying, hey, if you invest with us, you don't have to worry about the fee you'd pay to custody your crypto assets, but look, they have a lot of expenditure for a small company in custodying the asset themselves, the insurance, the due diligence, the accounting, internal controls, and reporting. All that is a cost that actually gets buried in the G&A, general and administrative section of their core operation. There are better things out there. I want to say the last, before we move on, about this dating candidate, it's also not just like the crypto bro-type partner, but the type of partner, your friends, who say you could do better. If you want to buy an enterprise software business, there are plenty of great ones out there. If you want to hold bitcoin now there are spot ETFs that make it really super simple for the investor to get involved. I don't know about this one, Mary. It is not pushing up my romance meter at this point in the game."", ""Mary Long: We've got other contestants that might be more appealing, so let's move on to them. Up next, we've got a date that has stories galore. Disney knows how to tell a good tale, but the company is going through some tough times. Disney spent a lot of money to sit at the cool kids table aka to join the streaming club, and now, despite having more than 150 million subscribers, Disney Plus and the company's other direct-to-consumer entertainment offerings have yet to generate a single quarter of positive operating profits. How did the House of Mouse fall so far?"", ""Asit Sharma: I like that you characterize it that way, Mary, because I actually like dating people on the rebound. I find sometimes that it's easier to find a partner than going out there and doing the hard work of someone who's, like, already taken. Let's talk about Disney here. As it relates to your question on streaming content, the first thing Disney did was to misprice its IP in the market placement. They had these great assets that they had developed over decades. They come into the game to compete against the likes of Netflix and really have what I thought was a great entry point. This is a few years ago when they started their digital streaming business. From the beginning, they should have priced their subscription services a little higher. This year, they bumped up their subscription prices by about 27% without much pushback from customers. They've also started to have that ad-supported tier that we see Netflix and other companies engaging with. Another thing I think that Disney got wrong was they took a lot of time to get their cost structure right for new streaming content. This was mostly under the former CEO Bob Chapek. This is Bob Iger's handpicked successor. The other thing that Chapek did, which was hard on this streaming business, was he took too much control out of the hands of creatives and how they would manage their budgets, the kinds of ways they could dream, and then put those dreams into production on a cost effective basis. I think Bob Iger righted a lot of this, and he's making it into a more efficient business."", ""Mary Long: Let's talk about those characters, Bob Chapek and Bob Iger, because in addition to all this baggage that we've just discussed, it seems like there's another wrinkle in this Disney character, which is that they might have a bit of a helicopter parent. Bob Iger, left the company, then Bob Chapek stepped in, then Bob Iger came back. Is Iger what the company needs right now, or are Disney's current growing pains due to the fact that this is a parent who can't let its child leave the nest?"", 'Asit Sharma: It\'s so complicated. I have so many thoughts on this. I am a parent. I have for a really teeny, brief period been a helicopter parent, but for those out there who have seen their colleagues become helicopter parents, there\'s nothing more maddening. Perhaps there\'s some truth in this that Iger is helicoptering a bit, but truthfully a little bit of this is on him. He misread the capabilities and business acumen of his handpicked successor, and so he created some of the problems. Now he\'s coming in to try to fix it, so maybe we shouldn\'t say he\'s a 100% helicopter parent. He is helicoptering, but I think he sees himself more as like the hero in this story. There is a wonderful song by the indie artist M. Ward, who I think many more people should listen to. The song is called Helicopter. In this song, the protagonist has a great line. After he saves a relationship, he says, ""Helicopter, helicopter, let your long rope down. Let us sway into the sunset. I have done all I can do in this town,"" and I think that\'s how Iger sees himself. He\'s coming to fix this problem. He\'s not helicoptering down. He\'s going to fix it. In 2026, if everything works out well, the rope will drop, he\'ll go off into the sunset.', ""Mary Long: I dig to a beautiful tale. Our next contestant goes by the name of ServiceNow. Also a tech bro, they're an enterprise software company that helps businesses replace manual processes with digital ones. Basically, the name of the game here is productivity. ServiceNow seeks to sign up some of the largest companies in the world as its clients. Because of that, it faces competition from big names like Oracle and smaller but crafty players like Atlassian. Going up against that competition requires some big dollars, but ServiceNow doesn't love to spend on acquisition. Is this company a big spender? What money is ServiceNow spending on research and development or sales and marketing?"", ""Asit Sharma: When you put them both together, Mary, they are a pretty big part of the company's cost structure. In the last trailing 12 months, general and administrative expenses have been about 46% of the company's top line, and R&D has comprised about 24% of every dollar of revenue. When you look at those together, they've been actually a little bit equal to gross profit for the last several years. ServiceNow has had anemic profits for such a big company and one that has these great relationships with enterprise customers, but in the last couple of years, especially in the last 12-18 months, they've hit that magical thing that every big company strives for. They've hit scale. Now you're starting to see that gross profit is growing in excess of the combination of sales and marketing expenses, G&A, and research and development. They spend big money, but they're getting a yield out of that."", ""Mary Long: They're spending big money. How do they act when it comes to tipping? Are they generous, or are they a bit stingy there? Basically, what's their stock-based compensation system look like? Does that change this earnings picture at all?"", ""Asit Sharma: They're a very handsome tipper. They have a very large percentage of their expenses that are expressed as stock-based compensation, meaning, thereby, if you're paying your employees a certain dollar amount, when we say stock-based compensation is high, it means the employees are getting a lot of stock as well as salary, and that dilutes shareholders, but I think ServiceNow gets a great yield out of that. They compensate a small army of software engineers and they're technically better than so many companies they compete with. They were able to pivot very quickly into generative AI, had great relationships with Nvidia. The core structure of their platform is very sophisticated. Now they're selling a lot of AI services that have a good return on investment. Not just like window dressing, AI-type stuff. The real core AI businesses that help companies get a little bit more productive. By the way, used that word earlier, Mary, productive is one of those characteristics that starts to get me flirting. When I see a company's productive, I start looking their way."", ""Mary Long: Last but not least in our lineup, we've got a character who's a little bit different than our other contestants. Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a dreamer. The biotech company builds innovative therapies to address and potentially eradicate severe diseases, especially cystic fibrosis. But, Asit, lots of people, lots of companies have big dreams. Vertex stands out from the pack by not just having big dreams but being pretty stable. They're a stable biotech, and you don't often hear those two words, stable and biotech go together. How has Vertex managed to find stability in an otherwise volatile sector."", ""Asit Sharma:\xa0Vertex got an early lock on the cystic fibrosis market through a drug called Trikafta. This is a drug that has helped a lot of people around the world deal with their CF, cystic fibrosis, and they've done really well at expanding the drug around the world and also getting approvals to market it to younger populations. That's been its core, stable revenue stream. For someone who has been through several relationships in his life, when you get to that person who has that steady income, they don't have a lot of emotional baggage, but they've got some fun things about them. Think they're ready to do new things, novel things, travel. You start looking at them as well and I think this is something that Vertex is very good at. Mary, you were talking about this when we were prepping for the show. That you think they've got some interesting other parts of their business that we should look at?"", 'Mary Long: The thing with dreams is they just keep going. Keep expanding. What other therapies is Vertex exploring beyond cystic fibrosis?', ""Asit Sharma: Sure. They've got a whole host of therapies in their pipeline, and they're all really ambitious. So just briefly, one is called Casgevy. I hope I pronounced that correctly. That's a gene editing therapy that they have developed alongside their partner CRISPR Therapeutics. It treats sickle cell disease. Also, something called transfusion-dependent Beta-thalassemia, which has to do with anemia in the blood. Both of these or this drug in both forms has just received approval from the FDA recently, so they're off to the racist with this therapy. They also have something that a lot of people are paying attention to called VX-548. This is a drug that's in development. It's a non-opioid pain drug. The potential, if it works out, is to really replace some of the potentially addictive medicines that some patients are reluctant to take when they have pain medication. Finally, they have something called inaxaplin. This targets APOL1-mediated kidney disease. It's in pivotal clinical testing. Now they've got a slew of other therapies that we don't have time to discuss, but this just gives you a picture. It's an ambitious company which is trying to lean on those stable cash flow streams that it's got from its CF drugs and move into different parts of the market and just get even stronger."", ""Mary Long: Asit, we've gone through a number of contestants, each with some green flags, some red flags. Out of these four lovely options for you, we've got MicroStrategy, Disney, ServiceNow, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which company are you giving your final rose to today?"", ""Asit Sharma:\xa0First, I have to say to all four companies, I really think there's something nice about each of them. I don't want anyone to go home heartbroken. They've all got some type of future, but I have to say that my rose goes to ServiceNow. This is a company that is executing on all fronts. It's just getting bigger at scale, and it is relentlessly ambitious. They're the kind of partner that I think always keeps it exciting and is always investing for the future. I like long-term relationships, and I think I could be happy with this one for a long time from now."", ""Mary Long: I wish you and ServiceNow a very happy future together. I'm so glad that we got to see the start of this budding romance here on Motley Fool Money."", ""Asit Sharma: Thank you so much, Mary, for being so patient as we worked through these very fine candidates, and now I'm off to my date."", 'Mary Long: [laughs]', ""Dylan Lewis: As always, people in the program may own stocks mentioned, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis. Thanks for listening. We'll be back tomorrow."", 'Asit Sharma has positions in Atlassian, Roblox, ServiceNow, Walt Disney, and Zoom Video Communications. Dylan Lewis has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Mary Long has positions in Roblox. Tim Beyers has positions in Chipotle Mexican Grill, Walt Disney, and Zoom Video Communications.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you may go to 5 Overlooked Tax Deductions for Retirees That Could Save Them Money.', ""If you get a notice from the Internal Revenue Service, don’t panic. Not all notices from the IRS are meant to be related to tax audits or collection notices anyway. This statutory service sends around 170 million notices to individual taxpayers on an annual basis. These notices are sent to help individuals claim the deductions and credits that they are eligible for, as well as meet their tax obligations. Many Americans are missing out on many of the valuable tax breaks being offered by the IRS, simply because they are unaware of them. Many times, they find the tax code too complicated, or simply don't fret because the rules on these tax exemptions keep on changing. However, individuals, especially retirees, must realize that they save on taxes in several ways. The two most popular ones that they can use are tax breaks and tax deductions. A tax deduction works by lowering an individual's taxable income for the year. On the other hand, a tax break gives a dollar-for-dollar deduction for the tax that is owed."", ""For our article, our main focus is going to be on tax deductions. These deductions can be claimed through two ways, the popular one of which is standard deductions. This deduction can be claimed automatically. The other way of claiming the deductions is to itemize your deductions instead. In the latter, an individual lists out individual expenses that they want written off in their returns. H&R Block, Inc. (NYSE:HRB) explains the difference between standard and itemized deductions in detail. According to H&R Block, Inc. (NYSE:HRB), an American tax preparation company, understanding these deductions can help individuals in maximizing their potential refunds, or minimize the amount that they owe. When claiming a deduction through either the standard deduction method or itemized deduction, an individual is allowed to claim the deduction that reduces their tax bill the most. However, claiming both isn't allowed."", 'The standard deduction was nearly doubled in 2018. The 2023 standard deduction for tax returns filed in 2024 is 13,850 for single filers, $27,700 for joint filers, and $20,800 for the head of household. However, many individuals do not know that this standard deduction is even higher for seniors who are aged 65 or older. As of tax year 2023, the extra standard deduction for seniors over 65 who are married and filing jointly is eligible for a standard deduction that is $1,500 more per qualifying spouse. On the other hand, an older individual who is the head of the family or is filing as a single is eligible for a standard deduction that is $1,850 more. For many individuals, it is easier to take this standard deduction because they perceive it to be higher. In other cases, according to Turbo Tax by Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), a looming tax deadline may otherwise pressure individuals to take the standard deduction rather than going for itemizing their deductions.', 'Nevertheless, there are many instances where itemizing tax deductions can make more sense, notes Turbo Tax by Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). For instance, your itemized deductions total is more than the standard deduction you would receive. Another case is when an individual has incurred significant out-of-pocket unreimbursed medical and dental expenses within the tax year. There are many more instances discussed below that individual taxpayers can use to save themselves money. According to H&R Block, Inc. (NYSE:HRB), individuals should get help for claiming their deductions. They can choose to file with a tax professional or even file with H&R Block Online to navigate their taxes. Whatever the option that they choose, the end motive is to avail of the biggest refunds possible.', 'A brokerage employee huddled with a group of retirees discussing retirement portfolios.', 'To compile the list of 13 overlooked tax deductions for retirees that could save them money, we have consulted various sources such as the IRS, Turbo Tax by Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), Kiplinger, Nasdaq, Investopedia, and AARP, to name a few. A consensus approach was adopted to award each tax deduction a point. Every time a source recommended a tax deduction, it was awarded a score. Scores were summed up and deductions have been listed in an ascending order from the lowest to the highest scores.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.', 'Here are the 13 overlooked tax deductions for retirees that could save them money:', 'Insider Monkey Score: 3', 'Seniors often miss out on claiming tax deductions on medical and dental expenses. The medical and dental expenses that are qualified for a deduction, however, are determined by the IRS. These deductions are applicable only for the portion of expenses that exceed 7.5% of your AGI. Some of the medical expenses that can be written off include insurance premiums, nursing services, eye care, long-term care, and psychiatric care.', ""If you're paying for prescription medications, those costs can be deducted from your taxable income as well. Items like insulin, eyeglasses, contacts, hearing aids, practitioner fees, and certain weight loss and nutrition programs are also included. Attending a medical conference about a disease that you, your spouse, or your dependent may have can also be claimed (excluding meals and lodging). For further details and information on how to calculate your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), you can visit the IRS website."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 3', 'One frequently overlooked tax deduction that retirees could save money on is charitable contributions. Incorporating charitable donations into your itemized deductions on your tax return has the potential to decrease your taxable income. When itemizing deductions surpass the standard deduction, the extra amount can lead to a tax reduction of approximately $1 to $12 for every $25 to $50 of value. For tax years 2023 and 2024, individuals can no longer deduct up to $300 in cash donations to qualified charities even if they take the standard deduction.', ""Those who are itemizing can in turn write off up to 20% to 60% of the AGI for charitable contributions. Individuals must also note that the 100% deduction of your AGI for cash contributions to qualifying charitable organizations was only a special deduction for 2021 and no longer applies. Moreover, seniors aged 70 ½ or older can also donate directly from a traditional individual retirement account known as a qualified charitable distribution (QCD). This is a direct transfer from an IRA to an eligible charity, where an individual can give up to $100,000 a year. Since the donation doesn't show up as income, seniors can get a tax break even if they don't itemize."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 3', ""Another overlooked tax deduction for retirees that could save them money is through IRA contributions from a spouse. To make contributions to an IRA, an individual needs to have earned income. However, just because you've retired doesn't mean that these contributions will stop. For those who are married and their spouse is still working, the spouse can generally contribute up to $6,500 to a traditional or Roth IRA that you own. The 2024 contribution limit by IRA has jumped to $7,000."", 'Therefore, an individual whose spouse is contributing to their IRA is eligible for the tax benefit. For tax year 2023, total combined contributions to an IRA cannot exceed $13,000 for 2023 tax year if only one of the couple is 50 or older. Meanwhile, total contributions cannot exceed $15,000 if both of them are at least 50 years old ($16,000 for 2024).', 'Insider Monkey Score: 4', 'While not exactly a tax deduction, seniors can also save themselves some money by availing of a tax credit specifically designed for low-income seniors. To be eligible for this tax credit, an individual must be ""qualified"" and pass two income tests. You are a qualified individual if you are 65 years or older or you were under age 65, you retired on permanent and total disability, and you received taxable disability income.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 5', 'Many seniors engage in a side business and similar entrepreneurial opportunities they can grab their hands on to enhance their retirement savings. These people need to pay income taxes on their self-employed income. However, those who are over 65 can gain deductions such as on the costs associated with running the business. Some of these costs include advertising expenses, supplies, home office expenses, expenses paid to consultants, and even business education expenses.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 6', 'Many employers offer Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) but retirees often overlook it as a strategy that could save them money. HSAs offer a triple tax advantage. These include pre-tax contributions, tax-free earnings, and withdrawals for qualified healthcare expenses on a tax-free basis. Once individuals reach 55, they can also get an immediate tax deduction for a small catch-up contribution on their health savings account. As of 2024, individuals can contribute up to $4,150 if they have coverage for themselves, plus the additional $1,000 catchup contribution if they reach 55 during the year.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 7', ""If you're into gambling as a senior or even as an individual, it pays to know that gambling losses are also tax deductible. However, these gambling losses are tax deductible only to the extent of your winnings. Moreover, all your winnings must be reported as taxable income on your return. This deduction is available on itemizing deductions on Schedule A and requires having a record of all winnings and losses."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 8', ""Seniors who become self-employed after retirement can deduct the premiums that they pay for Medicare Part B and Part D, as well as the cost of supplemental Medicare policies or Medicare Advantage plans. Whether a self-employed employee itemizes or not, they can deduct these expenses. However, those covered under an employer-subsidized health plan offered by either their employer or their spouse's employer can’t claim this deduction."", 'Click to continue reading and see the 5 Overlooked Tax Deductions for Retirees That Could Save Them Money.

(NYSE:DVA) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest full-year results, and the shares gained 8.2% to US$120. It was a credible result overall, with revenues of US$12b and statutory earnings per share of US$7.42 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that DaVita is executing in line with expectations. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year."", ' View our latest analysis for DaVita ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from DaVita's eight analysts is for revenues of US$12.6b in 2024. This would reflect an okay 3.5% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to increase 9.5% to US$8.64. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$12.4b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.36 in 2024. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates."", ""The consensus price target rose 12% to US$121, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. Currently, the most bullish analyst values DaVita at US$145 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$99.00. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation."", ""Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's clear from the latest estimates that DaVita's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 3.5% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 1.0% p.a. over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to see revenue growth of 6.4% annually. It seems obvious that, while the future growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, DaVita is expected to grow slower than the wider industry."", ""The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards DaVita following these results. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that DaVita's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving."", 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

In the past few years, there has been a significant rise in demand for telemedicine-focused online medical and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology services. Owing to the pandemic, many healthcare companies that were traditionally not technology-based transformed to survive in the market. Per a report by Precedence Research, the global healthcare analytics market was valued at $37.15 billion in 2022 and is expected to exceed $121.1 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 15.9%. Another factor prompting these MedTech players to embrace digital healthcare is skyrocketing healthcare costs.', 'On a positive note, rising dependence on telehealth and AI is likely to help the industry thrive in the near term. DaVita Inc. DVA, Encompass Health Corporation EHC, Option Care Health, Inc. OPCH and Addus HomeCare Corporation ADUS are likely to gain from the prospects.', 'Industry Description', 'The industry comprises companies that offer ambulatory care in an outpatient setting or at home. They use advanced medical technologies for diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation services. The players include operators of HMO medical centers, kidney dialysis centers and other outpatient care centers. After navigating a tough pandemic era, the payers and providers have been seeing steady growth on the back of innovation in services. This buoys optimism about prospects over the next few years, although persistent inflation in consumer prices could dent the outlook. The potential for scaling up innovation is an added plus. Also, the acceleration of value-based care models and the increasing application of technology across the healthcare industry are likely to continue in the long run.', 'Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Outpatient and Home Healthcare Industry', 'Cost Effectiveness: The primary advantage of outpatient clinics is cost-effectiveness. Outpatient medical care clinics do not retain patients for long hours (overnight) or charge exorbitantly. Modern-day outpatient clinics offer a broad spectrum of treatment and diagnostic options and even conduct minor surgical procedures. Financial incentives like health plans and government program payment policies supporting services in lower-cost care settings have also been driving outpatient care.Additionally, with value-based models of care steadily emerging as the future of healthcare, the shift from fee-for-service (FFS) to alternative payment models (APM) is an ongoing parallel trend. FFS will be crucial to care organizations as a benchmark through which providers can assess APM.', 'AI’s Dominant Role: AI has been a roaring success in healthcare, taking the outpatient and home healthcare space by storm. Outpatient companies prefer bots and automated techniques for managing health information. With the help of AI, hospitals have been achieving better outcomes, with patients receiving more efficient and personalized care. The outpatient industry has been generating huge profits from Electronic Health Records and ePrescriptions.The most visible area where AI can make a significant difference is in mental healthcare at home. Addressing the most prevalent mental health conditions among home care patients —depression, anxiety and dementia — is essential to improving overall patient well-being. In recent years, complex machine learning algorithms have become capable of analyzing large datasets of patient information, including clinical and social diagnoses. These systems can alert caregivers regarding potential triggers or warning signs of mental health deterioration.', 'Dependence on Telehealth: The pandemic caused a decline in outpatient clinic visits where home healthcare providers struggled to offer quality care due to the risk of exposure to the virus. Though the impact of the pandemic has been far-reaching, it has accelerated healthcare innovation. Home healthcare can gain from benefits provided by Medicare (and several other payers), comprising a broad range of services that can be delivered in a patient’s home, including post-operative and chronic wound care. Home healthcare has seen a surge in the utilization of the telehealth platform in response to the pandemic. With a rise in the elderly population and increasing costs of in-person health care, the demand for home-based health care will rise. People with chronic illnesses and disabilities also require home-based care.The rising demand for remote patient monitoring (RPM) has considerably driven the demand for wearable technology to monitor patient’s health. Although wearables have been popular for several years, their integration with AI has recently increased their popularity. Wearables have become a powerful home healthcare tool. AI technology-powered RPM enables healthcare firms to provide consistent patient care without occupying space in their hospitals and facilities, thus reducing overcrowding.', 'Staffing Shortages: The U.S. healthcare industry has been experiencing a severe shortage of workers at every level, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among support personnel, there is a laxity of home health aides. Increasing international migration of health workers may aggravate the health workforce shortfall, especially in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Another reason for the acute staffing shortage is high burnout due to physical, emotional and mental exhaustion. Overworked employees are leaving the profession at an accelerating rate.Healthcare staffing shortages lead to poor patient outcomes that can include hospital-acquired infections, patient falls and increased probabilities of death. With a lesser number of staff available in hospital settings for patient care, there has been a gradual shift toward home healthcare for non-critical patients who can be monitored remotely.', 'Zacks Industry Rank', 'The Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #69, which places it in the top 28% of nearly 250 Zacks industries.', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.', 'Before we present a few outpatient home health stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.', ""Industry's Stock Market Performance"", 'The industry has outperformed its sector but underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite in the past year.', 'The industry has risen 8.3% over this period compared with the S&P 500’s rise of 22.6%.

With an aggregate market value of $15.9 billion as of mid-2023, VeriSign Inc continues to be a formidable player in the domain name system (DNS) industry. The company's financial health is underscored by its operation of two of the thirteen global internet root servers, a critical component for internet traffic routing. The divestiture of its Security Services business in 2018 has allowed VeriSign Inc to concentrate on its registry services, which support the majority of global e-commerce through the .com and .net top-level domains (TLDs)."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with VRSN.', ""Market Dominance and Brand Recognition: VeriSign Inc's strength lies in its unparalleled position as the sole registry for .com and .net domains, which are foundational to the global e-commerce infrastructure. The company's brand is synonymous with trust and reliability in internet navigation, a reputation built over years of consistent service. This brand equity translates into a competitive advantage, as evidenced by the company's substantial market capitalization and the sheer volume of transactions processed by its servers daily."", ""Technical Infrastructure and Expertise: VeriSign Inc's operational excellence is a key strength, with a robust infrastructure that includes secure data centers and a global constellation of DNS servers. The company's technical prowess ensures high availability and security, which are critical for maintaining the DNS's integrity. VeriSign's commitment to R&D further solidifies its leadership in the industry, allowing it to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats and internet standards."", ""Regulatory and Pricing Constraints: VeriSign Inc's pricing power is limited by its agreements with ICANN, which impose restrictions on the fees it can charge for .com and .net domain registrations. This regulatory environment constrains the company's ability to rapidly adjust prices in response to market conditions, potentially impacting profitability and growth."", ""Reliance on Specific TLDs: The company's focus on a select few TLDs, while a source of strength, also represents a concentration risk. Any shifts in market preferences or regulatory changes affecting these TLDs could disproportionately affect VeriSign's business. Diversification into additional TLDs or internet services could mitigate this weakness."", ""Global Internet Growth: The continued expansion of the internet, particularly in developing markets, presents significant opportunities for VeriSign Inc. As more businesses and individuals seek online presence, the demand for domain registrations is expected to rise, potentially driving growth for the company's registry services."", 'Technological Advancements: Innovations in internet infrastructure, such as the adoption of new DNS protocols or the expansion of IDN TLDs, offer avenues for VeriSign to enhance its service offerings. By leveraging its R&D capabilities, VeriSign can develop new products and services that cater to the evolving needs of the internet community.', ""Cybersecurity Risks: As a guardian of critical internet infrastructure, VeriSign Inc faces persistent threats from cyberattacks, including DDoS attacks and social engineering. Despite robust security measures, the sophistication and frequency of these threats pose a constant challenge to the company's operations and reputation."", 'Competitive Pressures: The domain name registry market is highly competitive, with numerous gTLD and ccTLD registries vying for market share. VeriSign must continuously innovate and demonstrate the superiority of its services to maintain its market position against emerging competitors and alternative online identity solutions.', ""In conclusion, VeriSign Inc's SWOT analysis reveals a company with formidable strengths in market dominance and technical infrastructure, balanced by regulatory constraints and reliance on a few key TLDs. Opportunities for growth are abundant, given the global expansion of the internet and technological advancements. However, VeriSign must navigate the threats posed by cybersecurity risks and competitive pressures to sustain its leadership in the domain name registry space. The company's strategic focus on its core registry business and commitment to R&D positions it well to capitalize on these opportunities while mitigating its weaknesses and threats."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Ingersoll Rand believes Organic Revenue Growth is a helpful supplemental measure to assist management and investors in evaluating the Company’s operating results as it excludes the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions on revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain non-cash, non-recurring and other adjustment items. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income including interest, depreciation and amortization of non-acquisition related intangible assets and excluding other items used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and further adjusted for the tax effect of these exclusions. Organic Revenue Growth is defined as As Reported Revenue growth less the impacts of Foreign Currency and Acquisitions. Ingersoll Rand believes that the adjustments applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about non-recurring items that the Company does not expect to continue at the same level in the future. Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by Adjusted Diluted Average Shares Outstanding. Incrementals/Decrementals are defined as the change in Adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year period divided by the change in revenue versus the prior year period.', 'Ingersoll Rand uses Free Cash Flow to review the liquidity of its operations.

In addition, Ingersoll Rand believes that Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Incrementals/Decrementals and Free Cash Flow are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers, many of which also present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, and Free Cash Flow when reporting their results in an effort to facilitate an understanding of their operating and financial results and liquidity.', 'Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as alternatives to revenue growth, net income, diluted earnings per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

In these documents and during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.

On the call today from management for our opening comments are Steven Roth, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Franco, President and Chief Financial Officer. Our senior team is also present and available for questions. I will now turn the call over to Stephen Roth."", ""Steven Roth: Thank you, Steve and good morning, everyone. We ended the year on a high note with a good fourth quarter. The quarter and the year were right on target. Although as expected, our results were negatively affected by the dramatic increase in interest rates. This will carry through next year but I expect will reverse as interest rates receive. It's important to note that our business has continued to perform well. Michael will review the quarter and the year with you in a moment. This year, our New York City office leasing team won the gold medal. In the fourth quarter, we leased 840,000 square feet. For the full year, we leased 2.1 million square feet. Average bidding rents for the quarter and the year were record-breaking at $100 and $99 per square foot, respectively."", ""In more gold medal stuff for the year, we leased 1.2 million square feet at over $100 a square foot rents. The office leasing market is on the foothills of recovery but the capital markets still remain challenged and are even tightening -- and even tightening slightly as we speak. Foreclosures and givebacks are still in front of us and therefore, so is the opportunity. As Michael and I have said on the last few calls, retail in New York City has bottomed and is recovering rapidly. While rents have a way to go to reach peak pricing of 5 years ago, we feel very good about the activity level and strength of the retail recovery. And there's more big retail news. In 2 blockbuster deals announced in December, major global luxury retailer's product at time block front Upper Fifth Avenue properties for their own use as stores."", ""One deal was $835 million and the other was $963 million. So in round numbers, call it about $900 million for a half block front on Upper Fifth Avenue. So we now have the most important retailers in the world investing aggressively in real estate for their own use on the most important retail street in our country. This is only happening in the most important world cities, New York, London, Paris. Now we take this mark very personally because we own in our retail joint venture, so 52% on our share, a 26% market share of available Upper Fifth Avenue in 4 blocks -- half block -- 4 half blocks of similar AAA quality. I'm sure you can all do the math here. We also own in that same joint venture, the 2 best full blocks. So that would be 4 half blocks in Times Square and we have the largest signed business in town."", ""It's been a long ride and we announced just about completed construction of our renovation of the double block-wide PENN 2 and we are about 90% complete with the surrounding clauses. The huge positive in front of PENN 2, combined with the 33rd Street Promenade and the 33rd Street setback at ton [ph] have created an enormous open public space which I might say will be quite logistic. Directly core 7th Avenue [ph], the hotel PENN is now down to the ground, creating our PENN15 site. All this taken together is for sure a game trader. If you are a shareholder of Vornado or are interested in Vornado, this is an immediate must go see. The world turns in funny ways that creates opportunity. The Apocalypse is now passing, having handily survived the e-commerce attack."", ""But now we have a CBD office Apocalypse involving the work from home threat and the total black listing of office in the capital markets. In the end, the major cities of America will continue to grow and thrive with New York, our hometown leading that. All these workers will gather in offices with their colleagues rather than be alone at home at a kitchen table. And in the end, the supply-demand equation will come into balance and bring on a landlords market by a total cut-off of new supply. You can't build anything in these frozen capital markets. and in New York, the evaporation or relevance of, say, 100 million square feet of old, obsolete, unrentable space. This cycle was not over yet. There remain challenges but for forward-looking investors, the time is now."", 'My colleagues and I at Vornado are optimistic and excited. Now over to Michael.', ""Michael Franco: Thank you, Steve and good morning, everyone. Though 2023 was a challenging year, our core of retail businesses proved to be resilient. Our overall New York business same-store cash NOI and was up a healthy 2.8% for the year and was up 2% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Comparable FFO as adjusted was $2.61 per share for the year, down $0.54 from 2022 and largely due to increased interest expense which is in line with the expectations that we previously communicated. Fourth quarter comparable FFO as adjusted was $0.63 per share compared to $0.72 per share for last year's fourth quarter, a decrease of $0.09. Overall, the core business was flat and the entire decrease in the quarter was driven by increased G&A and lower FFO from sold properties."", ""We have provided a quarter-over-quarter bridge in our earnings release and in our financial supplement. We recorded $73 million of noncash impairment charges during the fourth quarter, primarily related to joint venture assets that we intend to exit in the next few years. It should be noted that in accordance with NAREIT's FFO definition, this impairment charge is not included in FFO. Now turning to 2024. While forecasting remains challenging in the current economic environment, we expect our 2024 comparable FFO to continue to be impacted by higher interest rates and be down from 2023 which already seems to be in the market. We project a roughly $0.30 impact from higher net interest expense due to extending hedges at higher rates on our variable debt."", ""Additionally, there will be a ding to earnings as we turn over certain spaces. Primarily at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 770 Broadway and 280 Park Avenue. This is temporary as we have already leased up a good chunk of this space but the GAAP earnings in these leases won't begin in 2024. We expect 2024 will represent the trough in our earnings and for earnings to increase meaningly with mayor [ph] as rates trend down and as income from the lease up of PENN and other vacancies clients. Now turning to the leasing markets. New York is clearly leading the leasing charge nationally as the city continues to experience strong employment growth. 2023 leasing in Manhattan ended on a strong note. And as we enter 2024, market conditions are more favorable in any year since the pandemic ensued in March 2020, providing support for the continued recovery in Class A office market."", 'The economy is healthy, most employers are back in the office at least 3 to 4 days per week. Competitive sublease space is tending and the market for higher-end space is tightening, fueled by a decline in the new development pipeline. Now that companies have greater clarity on their space needs, tenant demand is growing which is translating into more leasing transactions. With new supply of operating, tenants are increasingly focused on the highest quality redeveloped Class A buildings their PENN Station and Grand Central Station as they seek to attract and retain talent. Activity in the best buildings has been strong with vacancy at less than 10% and rents rising. Our best-in-class portfolio has been a major beneficiary of this trend and the stats bear out this that we consistently outperform the marketplace, as Steve mentioned earlier.', 'In 2023, we leased 2.1 million square feet and average starting rents of the industry-leading $99 per square foot with 1.2 million feet at triple-digit starting rents. Importantly, we made significant strides in addressing our upcoming vacancy and tenant roll at some of our most important assets with leases with the following important customers. Citadel at 350 Park Avenue, PJT Partners and GIC at 280 Park Avenue, King & Spalding, so in game and Cushman & Wakefield at 1290 Avenue Americas and Shopify at 85 Tenth Avenue. Additionally, at PENN 1, we maintained strong momentum with another 300,000 square feet of deals, highlighted by new leases with Samsung and Cannacord Genuity. Just as a reminder, since we started our redevelopment efforts in the Penn District, we have leased over 2.5 million square feet of office at average starting rents of $94 per square foot, a significant increase on what these buildings achieved previously.', ""Our fourth quarter activity led the overall market's leasing volume upturn as we completed 17 leases comprising 840,000 feet at starting rents of $100 per square foot. Even with our very strong close to 2023, our leasing pipeline heading into 2024 is robust. We currently have almost 300,000 feet of leases in negotiation with another 2 million feet in our pipeline at different stages of negotiation, including a balanced mix of new and renewal deals. Turning to the capital markets now. While the financing markets for office remain very challenging as banks continue to deal with problem loans, we are starting to see some stability with the Fed potentially cutting rates in 2024. Fixed income investors are constructive again on high-quality office and unsecured bond spreads for office have tightened significantly over the past couple of quarters."", ""That being said, we are still a way away from a healthy mortgage financing market in office. And most office loans will have to be restructured or extended as they aren't refinanceable at their current levels. More broadly, lenders have no appetite for construction financing across most property types which should keep a lid on new supply. Conversely, the financing market for retail is now wide open now that the sector has bottomed. As always, we continue to remain focused on maintaining balance sheet strength. Even in this challenging financing environment, our balance sheet remains in very good shape with strong liquidity. We are actively working with our lenders and making good progress pushing out the maturities on our loans which mature this year."", ""Our current liquidity is a strong $3.2 billion and $1.3 billion of cash and restricted cash and $1.9 billion undrawn under a $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."", 'See also Top 15 Electric Bike Brands According to Reddit and 25 Most Spoken Second Languages in the World.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Well, Homebuilders are feeling a lot more confident in February. The National Association of Home Builders reported that the index rose four points to 48 points in February. And builders are expecting for more buyer appetite to enter the market as these mortgage rates soften a bit. But what stood out to me from this report is really that builders will be pulling back on incentives. 20%, 25% of builders reported cutting home prices-- that's down from 31% in January."", ""While meanwhile, the share of builders offering some form of an incentive dropped to 58% in February-- that's down from 62% in January. So that's really different from what the public home builders have been saying on their earnings call. We've heard from DR Horton, Lennar. They've really pointed out that they are not going to be pulling back on incentives, especially that popular incentive, the mortgage rate buy down-- that is when you upfront the builder, upfronts the cost to lower the rate on the loan."", 'But another thing that really stood out to me from this report is the sales expectations in the next six months. That rose three points to 60, and any number that is higher than 50 really signals a good market. So that really does signal that they are confident about this market, that there will be some rebound and some turnaround ahead.', ""- I'm sure even without those incentives people trying to jump into that market.

And finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and diluted earnings per share. After our prepared remarks, we'll then close by answering your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Hardwick."", 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Thanks, Aaron. Good morning, everyone. As we announced yesterday, we finished 2023 with very strong financial results that were right on plan. As shown on Slide 5, earnings were $4.90 per share for the year, which included $0.13 per share of favorable weather, most of which we discussed earlier in the year. Excluding the estimated weather impact, earnings of $4.77 per share were at the midpoint of the guidance range we shared originally back in November of 2022.I'm very proud of our company's ability to stay focused on serving our customers safely and reliably through numerous economic events this past year, which gave us the ability to confidently execute on the plan we had for 2023. And I'm also proud of the resilient service we consistently deliver and especially over the past few months during a cold January and active storm season across the country. I want to thank our employees for safely providing reliable service to the 14 million people we serve in their homes, businesses and communities.You can see here on Slide 5, an abbreviated list of some of our key accomplishments in 2023, and John and Cheryl will add to these in their remarks. Overall, we believe the takeaway today for investors is that our strong execution in 2023 amid the challenging macro backdrop, coupled with our clear top tier growth plan demonstrates American Water's ability to deliver on our long-term plan. I'm very confident we will execute our plans in 2024 and beyond with the great momentum we have from 2023.Turning to Slide 6. As you can see, we have delivered an excellent total shareholder return over the past 5 and 10 years, including our growing record of significant dividend increases. We're proud of this history, which compares very favorably to other utilities. I want to acknowledge, though, that our stock and utility stocks in general did not perform nearly as well as the S&P 500 in 2023, which dampened the outperformance we've had versus the S&P 500 over the last decade or so.Relative valuations of utility stocks fell without regard to specific performance. All of that, while we continued our very strong performance. I'm confident our company's fundamentals and the execution of our strategies will continue to produce superior shareholder value and very competitive total shareholder returns for years to come, which takes us to Slide 7. The comments that we'll share today are largely an affirmation of the financial plan, long-term targets and guidance we laid out last November, highlighted by 7% to 9% EPS and dividend growth.Later, John will recap the drivers for our growth in 2024, including the increase to our EPS guidance range that we announced yesterday. Big picture, though, we believe the combination of our EPS and dividend growth are low-risk capital plan, our ESG leadership and the affordability of our service continues to be rewarded by investors and distinguishes us from other utilities in this sector. I'll remind you that we believe the runway for our growth and for achieving these targets is very long, certainly through 2028 in our 5-year plan and beyond that.This, of course, is driven by significant investments in infrastructure and acquisitions, coupled with our track record of constructive regulatory outcomes, all with a keen focus on affordability. And on top of all of that, we continue to grow organically, including in our military services business that successfully serves 18 military installations across the country. One final thought I want to leave you with as we begin 2024. American Water continues to receive tremendous support at the state and federal level for the work we do across the country. The impact we are making in communities across our 14 states to improve water and wastewater service is critical to the well-being of the citizens we are proud to serve.As we've told you many times, we are committed to solving local infrastructure issues, while at the same time, driving efficiencies in our business to remain very affordable to our customers. Policymakers frequently encourage our leadership to keep growing, keep investing and keep solving problems in their states. And this includes Pennsylvania, where we applaud the Public Utility Commission's proposal on February 1 to enhance the process around the implementation of fair market value legislation. We believe the spirit of the enhancements is to increase public awareness and establish greater procedural consistency, all in support of much-needed consolidation of the common wealth, water and wastewater systems.While the business of providing these critical services can at times lead to enhancements in the way we do business, including in the regulatory construct, we have no doubt about the overwhelmingly positive support we received from stakeholders as we pursue our company's mission. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about rate base growth, our regulatory plan and some recent news around lead service lines. Cheryl?"", 'Cheryl D. Norton', ""Thanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by turning to Slide 9 where these graphs illustrate that our continued successful execution of our capital investment plan is succeeding in growing regulated rate base consistent with our long-term rate of 8% to 9%. Rate base growth, of course, will drive earnings growth. We believe the high degree of visibility to our capital investment plan, combined with the low-risk nature of the plan, uniquely positions American Water in the utility sector and is fundamental to our investment thesis.Turning to Slide 10. I'll cover the latest regulatory activity in our states, beginning with our most recently filed cases. In Pennsylvania, we filed a general rate case in November and are seeking recovery of $1 billion of investments. The case is proceeding as planned, including testimony and evidentiary hearings that are scheduled for February and March. With rates still expected to be effective in August. As a reminder, Pennsylvania uses a forward test year for ratemaking purposes. In New Jersey, we filed a general rate case in January and are seeking recovery of over $1.3 billion of investments through December 2024. This case includes, for example, infrastructure improvement projects at all seven of our surface water treatment plants in the state.We expect the New Jersey case to be completed sometime later this fall. We also filed a general rate case last month in Illinois, where we have invested over $550 million since our last case. Our general rate cases in California, West Virginia and Virginia, are all progressing well and as expected. In California, we reached a partial settlement in the case in November related to the revenue request. We will prepare to implement the new rates retroactively to January 1, 2024, upon receiving the CPUC's decision on the settlement agreement and outstanding topics related to rate design and revenue stabilization mechanisms.Our request for a 1-year extension on the cost of capital was also granted, pushing the next filing out to May of 2025. In Indiana, we received a final order just yesterday, and it looks very constructive. We are currently evaluating it, and we'll share key takeaways in the next day or two, but overall, we're generally pleased. And finally, in Kentucky, we expect to receive a final order very soon.As a reminder, we expect to file general rate cases about every 2 years in our larger jurisdictions. Because we make prudent investments and have skilled and dedicated employees working on these cases, we're very confident in obtaining constructive outcomes again in 2024 as we did in 2023. On the legislative front, in New Jersey, new legislation supporting capital investment was passed and was signed by the governor in January. The Resiliency and Environmental System Investment Charge or RESIC, for short, establishes a new regulatory mechanism that will enable water and wastewater utilities to recover in a more timely manner, capital spending related to investments in resiliency, environmental compliance, safety and public health. This includes capital related to PFAS remediation.In fact, most of our states where PFAS is present. There are either existing environmental mechanisms that we believe PFAS investments will fit under or we're proactively advocating for such mechanisms. To show the magnitude of our regulatory execution efforts, you can see on Slide 11 that we have $390 million in annualized new revenues in rates since January of 2023. This includes $273 million from general rate cases and step increases and $117 million from infrastructure surcharges. We also have $670 million of total annualized revenue request pending. As a reminder, American Water recovers about 75% of our overall capital spend through infrastructure mechanisms or forward test years, which greatly reduces regulatory lag.Alongside all of the investments we're making, we remain extremely focused on customer affordability and operating efficiently. We are continuing to evolve our strategies around rate design and programs to assist our customers who are challenged with affordability. We are also continuing our focus on technology, efficiencies of scale and cost management to deliver on customer affordability, especially as the regulatory demand such as the proposed PFAS rule and lead and copper rule improvements drive increases in -- on our capital program.On Slide 12, I'd like to cover our recent announcements regarding the U.S. EPA's proposed Lead and Copper Rule Improvements. Like PFAS we think clear rules are important and should be enforced for all providers. American Water consistently meets water quality standards related to the lead and copper rules across our footprint and believes removing the risk of lead service lines over time is the right thing to do for the health and safety of our customers. But also like PFAS, we believe all stakeholders must understand the costs associated with the proposed improvements to the lead and copper rule and that the EPA estimates are likely understated.The cost to identify the material of all unknown service lines and replace all lead service lines, including the customer owned lines and galvanized lines were needed by 2037, will require significant investment for all water systems. We are currently developing preliminary estimates based on the proposed rule. Unlike PFAS though, the expected time line for complying with the Lead and Copper Rule Improvements is much longer, so the impact on capital spend will be more gradual. Providing safe, reliable and affordable water is American Water's business.We continue to work with the EPA, Congress, regulators and policymakers to ensure that the implementation of any final standards protect customers, community and the general public. As I close on Slide 13, you can see that our 5-year capital plan, which is unchanged from November, has $1 billion for PFAS and approximately $500 million for lead service line replacements. We have been proactively investing about $100 million per year to replace lead service lines for several years now and expect to continue that level at least through 2030 or beyond.Depending on the EPA's requirements in the final Lead and Copper Rule Improvements such as for customer-owned service lines, our annual investment level may need to be revised and likely over a longer period of time. Also, we are still awaiting a final rule from the U.S. EPA on PFAS. We continue to expect that there will be no material changes to the proposed rule, and we have not changed any of our announced plans or estimates last November related to PFAS compliance. We continue to treat for PFAS in compliance with state regulations and we continue to prepare for full compliance with the new federal rule once released.Previously, we have disclosed that we are a party to the multi-district litigation, or MDL lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina against manufacturers of certain PFAS like 3M and DuPont for damages. In early December, there were deadlines to decide whether or not to remain partly to the two potential settlements with manufacturers, and we did remain a party to both settlements. We believe this is the optimal path to recouping the most dollars possible from PFAS manufacturers in expedient manner for our customers. On February 8, the MDL Court issued its final approval of the DuPont settlement. We will now begin the process of perfecting our claims under this settlement within the time period provided by the MDL.A fairness hearing on the 3M settlement was held on February 2. This matter remains pending. In closing, it's important for investors to understand that the ever-changing regulatory environment is leading to significant industry challenges, including those related to lead and PFAS, but also with issues like cybersecurity, for example. Each change on its own is significant, but the layering effect of all these changes is even more dramatic. The expertise we bring to the table to solve these challenges is well recognized across the states where we operate and sets us apart from others.It's a privilege and a great responsibility to deliver safe, clean, reliable and affordable services to our customers and communities. With that, I'll hand it over to John to cover our financial results and plans in further detail. John?"", 'John C. Griffith', ""Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 15. Let me provide a few more details on financial results for 2023. The appendix also has details of fourth quarter EPS. Consolidated earnings were $4.90 per share in 2023, up $0.39 per share compared to 2022 and up $0.32 per share on a weather-normalized basis. Increased revenues were driven by general rate cases we completed in late 2022 and early 2023 in our larger states. These additional revenues are driven by the significant investments we've made and continue to make in our systems.As noted, earnings were higher in 2023 by an estimated net $0.13 per share as a result of weather in the second, third and fourth quarters due to warm and dry conditions, primarily in Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. This compares to net favorable weather in the third quarter of 2022 of $0.06 per share, which related to (inaudible) warm and dry conditions in New Jersey.And looking at operating costs, higher pension expense of about $0.13 per share and increased chemical costs of about $0.11 per share, including inflationary pressures are being recovered in large part through higher revenues we proactively sought in general rate cases we completed in the last 12 to 18 months. In the fourth quarter, we also had higher costs of about $0.10 per share related to waste disposal, equipment repairs, tank painting and other maintenance costs across our footprint.Supporting our investment growth, depreciation expense increased $0.24 per share and the cost of additional long-term financing increased $0.38 per share, primarily related to share count dilution. As I have mentioned all year, the EPS impact of the higher share count from our equity issuance back in early March was offset by avoided interest on the year. An additional benefit realized this year from the equity issuance is the interest income we have been earning from the cash balance held since March. Other reflects primarily post-closing acquisition adjustments in 2022 from the sales of HOS in New York, which added to EPS.Turning to Slide 16. You'll see that we continue to be set up for strong growth through acquisitions. We closed on 23 acquisitions totaling $77 million across eight states in 2023. We also have 25 transactions under agreement across seven states at year-end, totaling $589 million and 88,000 customer connections. This total includes both the Butler Area Sewer Authority wastewater system in Pennsylvania and the Granite City wastewater treatment plant in Illinois. We are very close to completing the Granite City acquisition, where we already provide wastewater collection service for approximately 12,000 customers.In Pennsylvania, as Susan briefly discussed, the regulatory environment relating to acquisitions is undergoing change, which we think is ultimately necessary and positive, but will take a period of time to sort out. We are very confident that Act 12 fair market value legislation will remain in place and continue to have strong support. As is often the case, implementation of legislation needs to be worked through in the regulatory arena, and that is what is happening now. In the meantime, closing of our current pending transactions will likely take more time than usual. But to be clear, we are confident that the previously approved Butler acquisition will close soon.We are continuing to invest in regulated acquisition opportunities in Pennsylvania, driven by the continued need for system consolidation and upgrading for the benefit of communities in Pennsylvania who deserve safe and reliable water and wastewater service. As you know, we have a strong track record of closing acquisitions. Over the past 5 years, we've closed over 100 acquisitions across 12 states, totaling nearly 200,000 new customer connections. Of course, as we close transactions, the work to build and refill our acquisition pipeline is continuous. Our pipeline of more than 1.3 million customer connections with meaningful contributions from across our platform continues to be a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our rate base growth outlook.As you recall, in November, we introduced our long-term target of 2% annual customer growth from acquisitions as shown on Slide 7. This equates to about 70,000 acquired customers per year based on our current customer count of approximately 3.5 million customers. We are proactively investing in our capabilities across our platform to bolster our system-wide contribution to acquisitions to support this growth and are confident in meeting our 2% long-term target.Turning to Slide 17. Here, we show the buildup from 2023 weather-normalized actual to the 2024 EPS guidance range of $5.10 to $5.20 that we introduced last November, which reflects 8% growth at the midpoint of $5.15. Working from that same buildup yesterday, we announced an increase of $0.10 per share to our 2024 EPS guidance range, which is now $5.20 to $5.30 per share. The increase is due solely to additional interest income we will receive in 2024 and expect to receive annually through 2026 from the amended terms of the secured seller note from the sale of HOS.As we described in the 8-K we filed on February 5, the note balance has been increased to $795 million from $720 million which satisfies payment of the contingent consideration owed to American Water of $75 million triggered by the extension of HOS's service agreement with the New York City water board. In addition, reflecting current market interest rates and removal of American Water's option to require prepayment of the note at a future date, the annual interest rate on the note has been increased from 7% to 10%.American Water is pleased to see the continued growth of the HOS business under its new ownership, including the service contract extension with New York City as well as the significant acquisition recently announced by HOS, which will be funded with new equity from HOS's owners. As it relates to future earnings guidance, it will be important for investors to be able to track the ongoing growth of American Water from its core regulated strategy before this additional interest income. Therefore, when we provide forward year EPS guidance each November, we will be sure to note the EPS associated with the additional interest income from the secured seller note in that guidance.To wrap up, Slide 18 is a summary of our continued strong financial condition, which we further solidified in 2023. Just last month, Moody's affirmed our solid Baa1 investment-grade credit rating and stable outlook and noted our improved FFO to debt ratio. We are confident our FFO to debt ratios will continue to support our current credit ratings. Our total debt-to-capital ratio as of December 31, net of our roughly $330 million of cash on hand is 55%, which is comfortably within our long-term target of less than 60%.While having moderated somewhat, the current higher interest rate environment continues to be challenging. As I said in November, though, we are in a position of strength on a number of fronts in dealing with this challenge. Our strategy of issuing debt at the holding company level allows us to take advantage of our scale and pricing debt issuances and we will remain proactive in managing risk and achieving a low cost of capital to the best of our customers and shareholders.With that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.', 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""I don't usually lead off with sort of an M&A question, but I know John loves talking about M&A, and we saw that in the prepared remarks. And obviously, it's timely given the Eversource news yesterday where they essentially put Aquarion on the block. Can you speak maybe to your appetite for larger inorganic opportunities? And specifically, any geographic aversions to the Northeast in light of the developments yesterday."", 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Shahriar, I think it's a great question. Obviously, we saw the news as well. And John certainly can comment more. I'd say, first of all, of course, we don't comment on any activity in the M&A space of that nature. I think for us, it continues to be our standards that we've shared. We have to be confident in the ability to grow. We have to have confidence regulatory environments, confidence in policy, support in any jurisdiction that we're currently in or other jurisdictions we may be looking at. So I think that's always the gate at which we evaluate opportunities. So I'd probably just say that, John, any additional comments from your side?"", 'John C. Griffith', 'Well said.', 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Perfect. And then just a follow-on. I know you're still kind of working through some of the ins and outs lead and copper rule. Is there even a general CapEx upside amount you could give us to think about would the spend sort of be additive in your view to the current plan? Or would it shift out some spend out like we saw with -- obviously, with PFAS spend on the last update."", 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Yes, Shahriar, let me again sort of generally answer and then Cheryl can add to it. I think it's -- first of all, it's sort of too early to be able to give any additional guidance around impacts to our overall plan. I think the important thing to remember here is it is over a much longer period of time than what we're seeing with the PFAS rules, for example. So it will give us more time to figure out what the actual impacts are to the plan, give us more opportunity to look at -- opportunity to move other projects around to sort of accommodate whatever spend we think maybe incremental here for us.So we just probably need a little bit more time to sort through it and then we can give a clearer guidance. Again, as Cheryl said in her prepared remarks, we know it will be significant. I don't think it will have the dramatic impact on our plan for shorter-term windows like we saw with PFAS, for example. Cheryl, anything you want to add to that?"", 'Cheryl D. Norton', ""Yes. The only thing I would add, Shahriar, is just that we have been making really good progress in that space. And we'll continue to be focused on removing our lead service lines and the customer lead service line where they exist. But this is a more inclusive rule that, as Susan said, is over a longer period of time. So we'll continue to look at how we can layer that in."", 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Yes. I think just to sort of punch line on that one, and Cheryl again made the comment in her prepared remarks, this is about unknown service lines, unknown material, and it is about customer owns. So as we've been working through our own program of replacing our lines, now we have the added requirement to look at unknown pipe and customer service lines. So that's why it gets bigger. And then again, the long-term time horizon to deal with it, I think, is also important to keep note of."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.', 'Durgesh Chopra', ""Just -- I hate to go back to the M&A. I know you're kind of going to be very limited in what you can say. But we've been getting a ton of questions on this. So I just want to be clear about something. In your seat, your peers generally describe M&A as a high hurdle rate, right, with the organic growth opportunities that they have as a company. How would you characterize the Connecticut water assets? Are these ones -- one-of-a-kind assets, those large assets that don't often come to markets extremely attractive? Or would you say the M&A opportunity is still a high hurdle rate versus the organic CapEx that you have? And I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I just want to see how you're thinking about it."", 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Yes. Durgesh, I'll tell you at the outset, you're not going to be happy with my answer because I'm not going to sort of go into a whole lot of detail here. I think -- our focus continues to be on the communities and the states that we currently operate in. And as you know, we're in 14 different states. We think there are just a significant number of opportunities in those states, and we're going to continue to focus on that. As you would expect anyone to do, we'll take a look at this kind of an opportunity as everyone would, but I think, again, our screens are the critical thing you should focus on. Regulatory environment, legislative environment, business climate and the ability to grow and that we're always going to look at opportunities from that perspective."", 'Durgesh Chopra', 'Understood. Susan, I appreciate that. Maybe then switching gears. Can you just update us on the Pennsylvania rate case, the commission, I think, came out in December, I think they may have suspended the rate case schedule. Maybe just talk to that, what does that mean? What are the next steps there, please?', 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Yes. Cheryl, I think laid out the details around timing. We've disclosed the size of the case, et cetera. Sort of big picture for me on this case. As is the case really with all of our general rate cases we have in progress, it's all about investment. We're not trying to do anything tricky in any of these cases, no significant policy changes from our perspective. This is simply about investment. That's what this Pennsylvania case is about and we'll continue to work through the process. There are no indications of any issues associated with this case as we work through the process, and we'll continue to stay on that path. I'd say that's generally the case on all of our jurisdictions, all the cases that we have on file today.We've been signaling this, I think, for quite some time that the expectation to be in for general rate cases on this roughly 2-year cycle. We've been saying that for probably 2, 3 years now, and this is just the continuation of that program. And it's all really driven again by our investment -- the pace of our investment, we've been increasing our capital spend plan for a number of years now to really address the needs that exist in the communities that we serve. And I think our regulatory strategy is consistent with that approach. So Pennsylvania is no different than any other state in terms of our approach to it, and we'll continue to work the process there like we always do. And we think Pennsylvania again, is a very constructive state, and we're confident in our ability to work through that case."", 'Durgesh Chopra', ""Got it. Just a quick follow-up there, Susan, -- like do -- does the procedure like the steps in the rate case in terms of testimony, intervenor testimony and all that stuff. Does that go along as planned with the suspension? Or is that on pause? I might have seen something that you maybe on pause. I'm not sure if..."", 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""No, no change. Yes, no change. It's on schedule and on the normal process."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport.', 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""I'm going to ask about Illinois first. I mean we have some very bad outcomes, regulatory outcomes on the electric and gas side in the states. You have a case there where we're already seeing some noise around it. So I'm just wondering how -- if there is any lesson learned from what happened in December and if you've incorporated that into the current timing? And then secondly, on PFAS, so we're seeing some lawsuits against investor-owned utilities on the back of PFAS. I understand that you've mentioned that you've been in compliance and going beyond requirements, but I'm just wondering how you manage this risk."", 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Yes. Again, let me sort of start off here. On Illinois, I would take my answer to Pennsylvania and insert the word, Illinois. We are proceeding there as scheduled with no significant issues in that case. It is about investment, and we'll continue to process that case like we always would. Certainly, there is noise around the electric and gas industry cases there. We think, again, our cases are different in that they are about investment only, and we're confident in our ability to continue to work through that case as well.On PFAS, Cheryl, you might just actually want to comment on Illinois, if you like. And then on PFAS. There's obviously a lot going on here, too. I think the litigation environment around this is probably not surprising. There'll be all sorts of plaintiffs' attorneys looking for an angle here. And I think that's probably what mostly you're referring to and what we're seeing. But Cheryl, anything you want to add on either of these topics?"", 'Cheryl D. Norton', ""Yes. I would just say, Susan, you were completely accurate on Illinois. We built a really strong case based on capital investment and we feel good about that case and the process. We're just going to go through the process there, the way we normally would. As far as the PFAS stuff, I do believe that there -- we've seen some lawsuits out there, [Julien], as you mentioned. But we've been working really hard both to make sure that we're in compliance with all the rules that are out there that we're being proactive in our approach. But we're also working with EPA on the CERCLA designation and working at the federal level to try to get protections for water utilities all across the U.S. because we believe that we shouldn't be held accountable for polluted waters that are coming to us, and we're doing everything we possibly can to treat for that pollutant. And so we think that we should be protected from that.So we're going to continue to work in that vein and in that space. And being part of the MDL, that's one step in that process to get recovery from the people who caused the pollution in the first place."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.', 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', ""And nicely done on the guidance here, I got to say. Maybe actually, to that point on guidance, given the bump here. Just with respect to resetting higher the CAGR going forward, I just want to recognize that this goes through '26. Implicitly, could we say this is a statement of confidence through the forecast period? Or is this more nuance to the specific 3-year forecast period, '25 -- '24 to '26 here, if you will?"", 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Yes. I think we've tried to be clear, Julien, on the sort of duration of this additional interest we'll have on the [NOL]. But John, do you want to comment on this further?"", 'John C. Griffith', ""Yes, I think you've got it right, Julien. It's -- think of this as an increase over our ongoing guidance for that period through '26. And that's -- but we've not made changes as we tried to describe in our comments from our original guidance on the regulated strategy from back in November?"", 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', ""Right. Yes, understood. I just wanted to clarify that extra clear. With respect to Illinois here, obviously, you've got this case out there, there's a certain degree of attention. Can you comment a little bit about maybe some of the rate mitigation factors, what other pieces could help offset some of the rate increases to customers in Illinois? And any other mitigating factors and circumstances around that case that we can speak to here, for instance."", 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Yes. I'll comment on sort of overall strategy on that point. I think we treat Illinois the same as we do our other states. I mean we've been very focused on mechanisms or approaches to regulatory solutions that will help lessen and mitigate the direct impact of inflationary cost pension and other things, we've done that via trackers, we've done that via deferrals, and we've done that sort of across many of our jurisdictions, and we have a good amount of those costs actually, frankly, already sort of dealt with and embedded in rate structures across our territory.No, Illinois, really no different than that. And as Cheryl said, we're just not experiencing other issues currently in that case. Now we obviously have to finish it. We have to get through the rest of the procedural schedule. And and work through any issues that may come up. But we're not anticipating anything materially different there."", 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', ""Yes. Excellent. And then lastly, just going back to the M&A point you were making earlier. I thought you were pretty clear about this. It needs to be accretive and/or provide robust visible growth. I just want to make sure I'm hearing you right about the growth piece there in terms of a key element in ingredient."", 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Well, I don't know that I said it has to be accretive. Are you -- I guess you're talking about the M&A piece. I think, again, I'll just repeat it. I think our view is that for us to look at new jurisdictions, it has to be productive, regulatory, legislative business environment. And the opportunity for growth, and I really, I guess, was referring to sort of footprint growth there. And obviously, you would apply a meaningful financial contribution from that too. So it's the same screens we've always had. It's the same dialogue we've always had on potential expansion into other territories. So I don't think this particular situation changes anything about how we feel about growth in other jurisdictions."", 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', 'Got it. And just going back to lastly on that FMV piece, you guys commented extensible here, but just the time line on getting that clarity there. And you talked about being a little bit more protracted. Just how does this sort of at least from a process perspective, finally get to some resolution as far as you guys are concerned? And then prospects on expanding it even from there, given where we stand.', 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Well, Julien, you're going to have to help me. On the first part of your question, I'm not sure what you're referring to."", 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', 'Well, just on the fair market value just in terms of potentially taking a little bit longer yes, indeed.', 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""I got you. I just didn't hear the first part. Yes, I think that, as I said in my remarks, and John expanded on a bit, I think that what the PUC has done in Pennsylvania is actually quite helpful. And I've got a lot of experience in the regulatory world over the last 40 years or so. I've seen many pieces of legislation enacted, and I've seen many situations where commissions have to work through the implementation of that legislation. And I think that's exactly what we're doing here. And as we said, we applaud the commission for taking this approach and really being thoughtful about it and understanding the importance of this legislation to the larger strategy in the Commonwealth. So I think the steps that are being taken make good sense.Now -- having said that, we do have to continue to work through how those guidelines ultimately may be employed. But we think it's just helpful. And we'll give a framework for all of us to be able to work more productively in. Now having said that also, we do have to sort out what it means in terms of timing, and we've got a number of cases, acquisitions that we're working on in Pennsylvania through the regulatory and approval process, and it's obviously impacting that a bit currently, but we expect that to clear soon and be able to get back on our way here."", 'Operator', 'Next question Comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.', 'Anthony Christopher Crowdell', ""Just a quick housekeeping question after Julien. You talked about the HOS note in the income, and you're very clear about that, that's more -- or not much of an ongoing earnings number. I think you talked about maybe it rolls off in 2026. When we move forward post '26, should we think about additional rate base that maybe backfills that on a more linear growth rate? Or -- and I know $0.10 of a $5 and some number is very small, but just does something backfill that to keep their earnings trajectory pretty linear?"", 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Yes. I think you hit on it, Anthony, there at the end. It's not terribly material. We think this is a great benefit from a cash flow perspective. The additional interest is nice to have. We think the certainty associated with the -- that contingent payment we had on the New York contract extension is quite helpful now to have that secured. So we think there's just a variety of things about the restructuring that made a lot of sense for us that don't necessarily translate into any material impact to our overall plan. So long answer to your question, we would not expect there to be a need for finding additional capital to sort of fill in that very minor hole that this $0.10 will create."", 'Anthony Christopher Crowdell', ""Great. And just if I could squeeze one more. And it's -- it's to Cheryl's comments earlier and unfortunately, it looks like most of the Q&A has been sidetracked by Eversource question. So I'm not asking an Eversource question. Just when Cheryl talked about the increased needs on water systems, cybersecurity, you just think of that, is that maybe a foreshadow to that maybe the smaller bolt-on acquisitions may come at a greater frequency because of the requirements that are being -- the compliance requirements that are being put on these smaller systems, was that where that was headed?"", 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Yes. I think this is an area we've tried to signal, I think, for the last several discussions we've been having, and I think really probably what prompted that even was PFAS as an example. We see that as just another area that may be difficult for some of these smaller systems to be able to manage, both from an investment standpoint as well as an expertise standpoint. Cyber is another great example. Interest rates is another great example. I mean, the list just gets longer, not shorter for these communities to sort of have to deal with.And from our perspective, we have always been very focused on trying to define what the need is for a community and helping satisfy those needs. And again, from an M&A perspective or an acquisition perspective, as that list gets longer, it creates more opportunity for us to have that dialogue and work with communities to solve those kinds of problems. So yes, we think it does have upside to our acquisition strategy. it's probably not a Tsunami though to use a water term. It's probably a much sort of longer-term impact I think it takes a bit of time for communities to sort of wrestle with these issues and determine impacts to them before they are ready to make a move.So again, we use these kinds of issues in our discussions. I think it will take some time before we see any measurable impact directly related to these issues."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.', 'Steven Isaac Fleishman', ""Not an M&A question. So the -- a couple of things on the HOS changes. So -- just the -- thinking about the shift in the interest rate on the note 7%, 10%, which is great. I mean that's a pretty high rate to pay for the seller and I guess soon to get rid of the prepayment. And so I guess I'm just wondering how do I think about just making sure that, that seller in terms of getting paid back -- getting paid."", 'M. Susan Hardwick', 'Great question, Steve.Yes. John, do you want to take this question?', 'John C. Griffith', ""Sure. From a credit perspective, we stay very close to the HOS business. We're, in fact, a partner. And as lender, we're constantly in touch with the business. The company has evolved, the credit has improved. Extending the New York contract is a significantly positive credit move and as I mentioned in my comments, the company is currently making an acquisition with new equity funding from their owners as well as cash on their balance sheet. So we do have covenants. They've remained in compliance with the covenants. And in fact, we've taken the opportunity to tighten covenants as well. But when you look at the underlying business, it's frankly doing better than it ever has. So we feel very, very good about the underlying credit here."", 'Steven Isaac Fleishman', 'Okay. Does the owner, does the private -- does the firm back it up to? Or is it just the business back up paying the rest?', 'John C. Griffith', ""Yes. No, the owner backs it up, and that's what I was trying to say. So when there's fresh equity coming into the business to make this acquisition, that's coming from APAC to who owns the business."", 'Steven Isaac Fleishman', ""Got it. And then just -- I know you have that sharing mechanism, too for the business. Could you just maybe let us know kind of how much income you made on the sharing mechanism part in, let's say, 2023 or -- yeah."", 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Yes. Steve, I don't know if we had that disclosed. Is it separate in the 10-K? Yes. Steve, we can point you to it. I'll have Aaron follow back up with you to point you to it. But I think it is in the 10-K, which obviously, we filed last night. And this is the revenue-sharing mechanism you're referring to, where we collect the share of the revenue that's generated from the warranty work that they're doing in our various state jurisdictions where we have (inaudible). Yes, yes. So Aaron will (inaudible)."", 'Steven Isaac Fleishman', ""Last on the Pennsylvania case, I think two of the commissioners sent a letter at the beginning of the case, just kind of framing it. I'm not sure -- is that abnormal would you say? Or is that normal for your Pennsylvania cases? How would you characterize that?"", 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Yes, I would say it's probably not necessarily customary, but again, we think that this case is proceeding as it should. We don't really see, again, any issues here. It's a big case. I mean it's $1 billion worth of investment and we were in just a little under 2 years ago on this case. So it's certainly material. And again, solely driven by investment in the jurisdictions that we -- or the communities that we serve there."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo.', 'Jonathan Garrett Reeder', 'I just wanted to come back to [PA] and the fair market value stuff, do you anticipate that all the changes to the fair market value will come via the commission process? Or do you think some of the bills in the legislature will make it across the finish line?', 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Yes. Our view is that this is the best path and the likely path to sort of resolve issues around fair market value in Pennsylvania. Again, I think this is normal practice. And I'm not speaking specific to Pennsylvania. I'm just saying normal in my 40 years of experience, this happens fairly regularly where commissions are charged with interpreting legislation and applying the provisions of it. And that's what I think this commission is doing, and I think they took a very proactive step here to do exactly what you're talking about to resolve the issues and be able to effectively implement the legislation.I think there's no one -- well, I shouldn't say no one. There are a few probably that have conceptual problem with what fair market value legislation was intended to do. I think there's a good understanding of the need for consolidation in the state, and this is the mechanism to allow for that to occur. So I think it stands, and I think the commission will do the work necessary to make sure that the legislation is effectively enacted and implemented."", 'Jonathan Garrett Reeder', ""Yes. So I mean you're saying PA is, in your opinion, very much fully behind continued promotion of consolidation."", 'M. Susan Hardwick', 'Yes. I think as a state, as a Commonwealth, I believe that is a true statement, yes.', 'Jonathan Garrett Reeder', 'Okay. what sort of impact do you think it will have on the deal activity? And would you say the proposed RRR will make it tougher for AWK to deliver on the M&A CapEx placeholders?', 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""I think we'll have to see how it plays out and how ultimately it gets worked from a procedural standpoint. But I'd say, generally speaking, no. we do not see it having a material impact on available opportunities and then ultimately, the outcomes on transactions."", 'Jonathan Garrett Reeder', ""Okay. And then last question for me. I saw that in at least the PA and New Jersey rate case filings that revenue decoupling requests were made, possibly, it's in the Illinois case, too. Do you typically make those decoupling requests and just don't get them? Or is that something new that you're pursuing?"", 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Yes, it's a good question. I'd say it varies across jurisdictions. And again, part of our job here is to really understand what each commission is comfortable with and what mechanisms work or don't work in a particular jurisdiction. And it's also part of our responsibility to educate and to inform commissions and their staffs about how various mechanisms can work and what the impacts are. So we do that across our jurisdictions. And I think we have really been more proactive in that regard over the last couple of years.And so I think as we do that education and that dialogue, it will inform where we propose what mechanisms. So I wouldn't necessarily say it's a broad application. The decoupling is always on our list. In every jurisdiction, I think it's all circumstantial. What mechanisms work best in what jurisdictions and we work accordingly."", 'Jonathan Garrett Reeder', 'Okay. But for PA in New Jersey, are these new proposals? Or have they been there and, say, your most recent case, too?', 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Yes. I'd have to go back and look to see if we had them specifically in those cases. I don't actually recall. But again, I wouldn't necessarily think this is breaking new ground on either of these proposals."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS.', 'Gregg Gillander Orrill', ""Yes. Thank you. Just a question on the PFAS settlements. Just sort of your expectation on the outcome following up on the 3M settlement there. And thanks for the additional updates. I'm just curious if anything's changed around your view of the company's sort of legacy liability to PFAS if there is one?"", 'M. Susan Hardwick', ""Yes. On the first question, Gregg, around just settlement expected outcomes. Obviously, that process is proceeding. And we had one settlement approved and the other one fairness hearing has occurred, and we would expect it to ultimately get approved. And then the process begins of claim submittals and really going through the settlement allocation process. So obviously, it's too early for us to be able to give you any indication of what we think the outcomes will be financially. But as we've said all along, these will be cents on the dollar in terms of recovery. We don't expect, obviously, for it to cover the full cost of exposure here. But the amounts to be recovered through the settlement, we think is quite important and the best avenue, as Cheryl said in her remarks, to collect dollars on behalf of the customer to reduce the overall obligation the customer has.So it's a good process. We've been happy to be involved in it. Our team, I think, in a lot of ways, is leading much of the effort around getting this work through the courts and getting outcomes here that are quite favorable.To your second question on how do we view sort of legacy exposure here. I don't think our view changes.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments."", ""While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases."", 'American Water Works in Focus', ""American Water Works (AWK) is headquartered in Camden, and is in the Utilities sector. The stock has seen a price change of -8.72% since the start of the year.

Over the last 5 years, American Water Works has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 9.28%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend.

However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.', ""For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, AWK presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy)."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan has granted marketing and manufacturing authorization for Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in people aged 12 years and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with existing therapy. Japan is the first country to approve Dupixent for CSU, emphasizing the value of Dupixent as a novel treatment option to manage this disease in patients with unmet needs.', 'CSU is a chronic inflammatory skin disease driven in part by type 2 inflammation, which causes sudden and debilitating hives and persistent itch. CSU is typically treated with histamine-1 (H1) antihistamines, medicines that target H1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of urticaria. However, the disease remains uncontrolled despite antihistamine treatment in many patients, some of whom are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms that can be debilitating and significantly impact their quality of life. Approximately 110,000 people aged 12 years and older suffer from uncontrolled moderate-to-severe CSU in Japan, for which there are currently limited treatments.', 'The Japanese approval is based primarily on data from Study A of the LIBERTY-CUPID clinical trial program evaluating Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care H1 antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone (placebo) in 138 patients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine use and were not previously treated with omalizumab. This study met the primary and all key secondary endpoints. Patients taking Dupixent added to standard-of-care antihistamines experienced a significant reduction in itch severity compared to standard of care alone at 24 weeks. The safety profile of Dupixent in CSU was generally consistent with the known safety of Dupixent in its approved dermatological indications.', 'In addition to CSU, Dupixent is approved in Japan in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), and prurigo nodularis.', ""About DupixentDupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, prurigo nodularis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)."", 'Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE, prurigo nodularis, and CSU in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in Japan, Europe and the U.S. More than 800,000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.', 'The potential use of Dupixent in CSU is under clinical development in additional countries around the world, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of Japan.', ""About Regeneron’s VelocImmune Technology\xa0Regeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb), Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz™ (pozelimab-bbfg)."", 'Dupilumab Development Program\xa0Dupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.', 'In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including chronic pruritus of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with evidence of type 2 inflammation, and bullous pemphigoid.

Dermatologists and other providers nationwide can begin ordering the test from the company as well as through Dermpath Diagnostics — Quest's subspecialty pathology business."", ""The Netherlands-based SkylineDx focuses on the research and development of molecular diagnostics in oncology and inflammatory diseases.

MelaNodal Predict incorporates SkylineDx's innovative technology, which utilizes a combination analysis of patient age and tumor thickness with advanced gene expression profiling technology. The test examines a patient's original diagnostic tumor biopsy and applies an algorithm to help providers identify patients with a low or high risk of nodal metastasis (melanoma that has spread to the lymph nodes)."", 'Findings from the test can help providers identify patients who could, with less risk, avoid a potentially unnecessary, expensive and invasive surgery called a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). By reducing SLNB interventions, providers who utilize the test may be able to more effectively use healthcare resources and manage patient risk. It is estimated that patients who receive an SLNB have a greater than 10% risk of surgery-related complications, including bleeding, infection and limb swelling.', ""The test also provides insights into a patient's long-term outcome, as patients with a low-risk result have reported better survival rates. All studies of the algorithm utilized have reported minimal follow-up after five years. In addition, recent data from six U.S. institutions shows that patients classified by the algorithm as low risk have a survival rate of more than 90 percent."", 'The new collaboration leverages Quest Diagnostics’ expertise and national scale in the United States, which includes broad electronic health record connectivity and health plan relationships and more than 400 Quest, Dermpath, AmeriPath, and PhenoPath pathologists.', 'Per a research report, the global melanoma therapeutics market was valued at $5.5 billion in 2022 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 10.3% by 2032.', 'Oncology has been one of the focus areas for high growth within DGX’s highly specialized advanced diagnostics offering.
