Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Verisk Analytics (NASDAQ:VRSK). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Verisk Analytics How Quickly Is Verisk Analytics Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Impressively, Verisk Analytics has grown EPS by 35% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. It was a year of stability for Verisk Analytics as both revenue and EBIT margins remained have been flat over the past year. That's not a major concern but nor does it point to the long term growth we like to see.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Verisk Analytics' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre Verisk Analytics Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$29b company like Verisk Analytics. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$257m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.9% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Verisk Analytics, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$13m.The CEO of Verisk Analytics only received US$3.9m in total compensation for the year ending December 2021. That looks like a modest pay packet, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Is Verisk Analytics Worth Keeping An Eye On?For growth investors, Verisk Analytics' raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. If you still have your doubts, remember too that company insiders have a considerable investment aligning themselves with the shareholders and CEO pay is quite modest compared to similarly sized companiess. This may only be a fast rundown, but the key takeaway is that Verisk Analytics is worth keeping an eye on. Before you take the next step you should know about the 4 warning signs for Verisk Analytics (1 can't be ignored!) that we have uncovered.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want. But if you prefer to focus on stocks that have demonstrated insider buying, here is a list of companies with insider buying in the last three months.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

8,8825fc70-9661-3c84-8420-f09261853e44,SCHW,2023-03-31,12 Questions to Ask Before Early Retirement,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-questions-ask-early-retirement-153159971.html,1680190319,STORY,"['SCHW', 'IBKR']","[In this article, we discuss the questions to ask before early retirement. For more on this, go to 5 Questions to Ask Before Early Retirement.Early retirement is a big decision to make. When done right, you get to live your dream life and when done wrong, it can come back to haunt you. While early retirement is a normal phenomenon for various reasons, the pandemic has skewed the retirement numbers. According to the National Institute on Retirement Security, more than a quarter working Americans moved up their retirement dates because of the pandemic in 2021, with 3 million Americans retiring earlier. However, there’s more to the increasing number of early retirements than just the effects of the pandemic. The number of retiring Americans aged 55 years or older grew by 1 million every year, on average, between 2008 and 2019, as reported by a Pew survey.Many factors have played a role in this phenomenon, including rising household wealth, safety and health concerns in the workplace, as well as burnout, with the latter impacting slightly more than half of the Americans, as noted in an Indeed survey in 2021. The Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) MovementAmong other reasons for early retirement include the influence of the Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement, whose proponents aim to retire earlier by saving up to 70% in their annual income, and then withdrawing 3% to 4% from their retirement fund to cover their post-retirement expenses.The movement’s subreddit, by the same name, has close to 2 million members as of 2023. Other movements influencing early retirements include the Anti-Work movement, whose subreddit has 2.5 million members. Early retirement takes a lot of planning and you have to make a lot of preparations in order to make sure you don’t go broke after retirement. A 2021 update of the 2019 National Retirement Risk Index showed that 50% of households were at risk of not being able to maintain their standard of living after retirement. In 2021, only 50% of Americans calculated how much they would need in retirement savings, according to the US Labor Department.Story continuesThere are several factors to account for, in case you decide to retire early, like healthcare, benefits, investment and spending. Most people take care of their expenses through social security, where some of their taxed income is marked for retirement benefits, which can be applied for, to obtain financial benefits from the state once they retire. Then there are retirement investment services by companies like Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). Other options include The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) and Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR), which retirees can avail to help them increase their financial resources.Both The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) and Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) offers Individual Retirement Accounts.A note on social security, if you retire early and tap into your social security, your benefits would be reduced. The Social Security Administration (SSA) uses a formula to determine your benefit amount based on your highest 35 years of earnings. If you retire before your full retirement age, which is currently 66 or 67 depending on your birth year, your benefits will be reduced by a certain percentage for each month you receive benefits before reaching full retirement age.If you retire early but continue working in some capacity, your social security benefits may be further reduced if you earn more than the earnings limit set by the Social Security Administration. In 2023, the earnings limit is $21,240 per year, and for every $2 earned above that limit, $1 of your benefits will be withheld.You should speak with a financial advisor or Social Security representative to better understand how your specific retirement plans and timeline may impact your Social Security benefits. Below, we outline 12 questions to ask before early retirement. These would allow you to make a better decision and also prepare you with the knowledge-base to allow you to keep maintaining your living standard post-retirement.With that said, we move to the 12 questions to ask before early retirement.Questions to Ask Before Early Retirement Photo by Ovidiu Gruescu on UnsplashMethodologyFor the list of 12 questions to ask before early retirement, we've observed what people are talking about, what their major concerns are and how they're preparing for early retirement on subreddits like r/FIRE (Financial Independence &amp; Retiring Early). If a matter/question appeared frequently and repeatedly during our research, we assigned it more importance. We've then picked up the consensus points of concern and listed them here in ascending order of importance. We’ve also gathered data from various credible and authoritative sources like AARP, Forbes, Investopedia, US Department of Health and Human Services, just to name a few, which will help quantify the substance we discuss for the questions.Here are the 12 questions you need to ask yourself before deciding to retire earlier:12. What Effects Will Early Retirement Have on my Social Security?This is one of the most important questions out of the 12 questions to ask before early retirement. As mentioned earlier, social security is a retirement security system in place in the US. Some of your taxed income during your lifespan is reserved to be paid to you episodically in benefits once you retire. According to the Social Security Administration, the retirement age, if you were born in 1960 or later, is 67. Medium income earners get 42% of their pre-retirement income in social security if they avail it at the retirement age. However, applying for social security due to early retirement reduces the percentage you’d be getting episodically.According to AARP, If you apply for social security earlier than the retirement age, it reduces the benefits by 5/9 of 1% for each month until you reach the full retirement age up to 36 months, and 5/12 of 1% for each individual month. So before you make a decision on early retirement, you need to have plans to apply for social security at an appropriate time so that it doesn’t affect your or your family’s standard of living.11. Should I Relocate After Early Retirement?Once you take early retirement, there may not be a stable source of income for you and you want to make sure your savings are not exhausted. For this purpose, you might want to consider moving to another place, where cost of living is relatively affordable, without any effects to the standard of living.You can consider various places within the United States. California and New York top the charts in being the most expensive states in cost of living and taxes. So, if you happen to live in either California or New York, you could consider moving to another state like Indiana or Texas, where cost of living isn’t as high and does not impact the standard of living either.10. Do I Have My Future Covered?This is another very important question out of the 12 questions to ask before early retirement. One of the best ways not to get caught off-guard by circumstances after early retirement is to plan ahead. Investopedia reports the average savings for people who are in their 40s and 50s as $63,000 and $117,000, respectively. If you fall somewhere in these age groups, chances are that your savings approximately reflect the average.  So you want to be careful how you spend your savings if you have decided to retire earlier. And if retiring earlier, but not anytime soon, you can consider saving a proportion of money that can help you catch up with Fidelity’s rule of thumb of saving 15% of your pre-tax income each year.Plan for every reasonably likely contingency you might come across financially and set aside your savings for them separately. Then, you need to calculate average monthly expenses for utilities you will have to incur in your retirement days and set that income aside. Thirdly, you’d want to separate some part of your financial resources for luxurious amenities like holidays and dining.9. How Should I Invest?Investment after early retirement can pay off and secure your financial resources’ against future economic uncertainties. Then there’s the factor of inflation. Even if you spend very carefully, your savings, adjusted for inflation, could fall short of your spending estimates for your post-retirement life. Therefore, it is a sound decision to spend on investments that are reasonably likely to give good returns.There are various very lucrative investment opportunities out there, but good returns, even likely in many instances, are never guaranteed. Most experts recommend the 60/40 rule, where 60% of your investments should be in stocks, while the remaining 40% should be in bonds and money markets. This diversification achieves a balance of growth and risk.There are various mediums for investment you can choose from, with platforms like Merrill Edge, owned by Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). Apart from Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) and Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) are also popular among retirees for IRAs. 8. Should I Delay My Decision to Retire?If you’re doing fine in your working life and there’s no critical reason you want to early-retire other than to enjoy or check your bucket-list wishes if you will, then you might want to reconsider your decision and entertain the thought of delaying retirement for some more years.The reasoning behind this is the benefit of compound interest on your saving deposits, which you’d likely be cashing in on, in case you retire. If you worked for 15 years and have sufficient amounts in your savings deposits, working seven to eight more years can multiply it even more, assuming of course that you do not have a critical reason to retire.7. Should I Go for Private Health Insurance?This is actually one of the most important questions out of 12 questions to ask before early retirement. On average, an American individual spent close to $13,000 in healthcare in 2021, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Unlike social security, you cannot just apply for the federal Medicare program at any time in your life, unless you have been physically disabled. So unless you have been disabled, you can only avail Medicare when you’re at-least the age of 65, according to the US department of Health and Human Services.So if you plan to retire earlier, you have two options: to either cover your health safety through your savings, or get private health insurance. In the former case, you’d be risking your finances, if by some misfortune, you fell into a serious health crisis before you’re eligible for Medicare. Therefore, it’s prudent to get private health insurance and cover your health until you’re eligible for Medicare.6. If I Receive a Pension Upon Early Retirement, How Would It Turn Out If My Former Employer Went Bankrupt?If your employer has pension plans for employees, then it adds another source of income post-retirement, but you have to entertain the possibility, regardless of likelihood, of your employer going bankrupt. If that happens, your pension is covered and guaranteed by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation of the US Government, albeit, at a reduced amount. So you have to make adjustments to how you spend your savings based on these possibilities.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Questions to Ask Before Early Retirement.Suggested Articles:25 Best Countries For A Comfortable Retirement15 Biggest Retirement Communities in the WorldEarly Retirement Portfolio: 15 Stocks to Live Off Dividends RevisitedDisclosure: none. 12 Questions to Ask Before Early Retirement is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

10,6c26e685-9a4c-3f44-abdb-cfac9021b229,TXN,2023-03-31,Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) insiders sold US$2.3m worth of stock suggesting impending weakness.,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-incorporated-nasdaq-txn-110114106.html,1680260474,STORY,['TXN'],"[The fact that multiple Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments Texas Instruments Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Senior Vice President of Analog Signal Chain, Hagop Kozanian, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$170 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$184). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 12% of Hagop Kozanian's holding.Insiders in Texas Instruments didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Story continuesInsiders At Texas Instruments Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Texas Instruments shares. In total, insiders dumped US$386k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Does Texas Instruments Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Texas Instruments insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$205m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Texas Instruments Insiders?Insiders sold Texas Instruments shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Texas Instruments makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To that end, you should learn about the 3 warning signs we've spotted with Texas Instruments (including 2 which don't sit too well with us).But note: Texas Instruments may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

11,6a416d86-32a8-35c4-8a79-91b18007a36c,TXN,2023-03-31,7 Cash-Rich Companies That Can Weather Any Storm,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-cash-rich-companies-weather-190746069.html,1679944066,STORY,"['BIDU', 'TXN', 'FNV', 'MNST', 'GOOGL', 'WYNN']","[With global market and economic fears once again rising to the forefront, investors may want to consider cash-rich companies that can weather any storm. Fundamentally, enterprises that carry plenty of green in their pockets should be able to navigate whatever curveballs the gatekeepers of the economy decide to throw. For that, I filtered out stocks based on their market capitalization and cash ratio.For the former metric, the thought process is fairly logical: the bigger, more established enterprises should prove more resilient under pressure. Regarding the latter, the cash ratio represents a measurement of liquidity. Per Investopedia, it calculates the company’s total cash and cash equivalents line to its current liabilities. In other words, under a theoretical scenario where an enterprise had to pay its debt using cash (or its equivalents) only, the cash ratio gives investors a decent sense of fiscal substance. With that, below are the cash-rich companies to consider.TXNTexas Instruments$178.23FNVFranco-Nevada$143.87WYNNWynn Resorts$106.90MNSTMonster Beverage$104.76GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$103.77BIDUBaidu$152.31CCJCameco$24.68InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTexas Instruments (TXN)7 Stocks to Buy Benefiting From Millennial MoneySource: ShutterstockOne of the major technology giants, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally. Since the start of the new year, TXN gained 10% of its equity value. And while it’s down nearly 3% in the trailing year, Texas Instruments improved significantly from 2022’s tech sector implosion.Moving forward, the global economy faces myriad uncertainties. Fortunately, TXN appears well-prepared for whatever lies ahead. First, the company carries a cash ratio of 3.04 on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis. As well, it enjoys a robust balance sheet. In particular, the tech giant’s Altman Z-Score pings at 12.83, indicating an extremely low risk of bankruptcy. Also, it’s a highly profitable enterprise. For example, its operating margin comes in at 51.91% while its net margin stands at 43.68%.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg TXN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $184.94, implying 3% upside potential. While it might not be wildly exciting, it’s one of the cash-rich companies to consider.Franco-Nevada (FNV)a man sitting on a chair, typing on a laptop while cash falls from the ceilingSource: ShutterstockA gold-focused royalty and streaming company, Franco-Nevada (NYSE:FNV) offers an intriguing idea for cash-rich companies. Because of its business structure, Franco-Nevada enjoys greater predictability. It’s not a mining enterprise but rather financially supports miners in exchange for a portion of revenue or metals extracted. It’s also a hefty operation, featuring a market cap of 38 billion CAD (roughly $27.5 billion).Fundamentally, the fear trade should bolster Franco-Nevada’s precious metals business. As well, the company features a cash ratio of 23.83 times on a TTM basis. Better yet, the enterprise enjoys a stout balance sheet. It features zero debt, affording flexibility for whatever troubles may materialize. Also, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 80.81, indicating practically no chance of bankruptcy within a two-year period.Also, Franco-Nevada fires on all cylinders operationally. Its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 16.2% while its net margin is up to 53.21%. Lastly, covering analysts peg FNV as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $153.20, implying 6% upside potential.Wynn Resorts (WYNN)cow made out of cash in green field with bright blue sky behind itSource: Reel2Reel/shutterstock.comBased in Las Vegas, Nevada, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) is a developer and operator of high-end hotels and casinos. Of course, during the first two years of the Covid-19 crisis, Wynn Resorts and the hospitality industry suffered substantially. However, as social dynamics such as revenge travel took hold, Wynn began putting the pieces back together. Presently, it ranks among the cash-rich companies to consider.First, Wynn features a cash ratio of 2.02. Second, Wynn may enjoy one of the better forward-looking narratives. In particular, as the global casino gaming environment normalizes – especially in Asia – Wynn could benefit handsomely. To quickly summarize, gamblers in Asia tend to gamble, offering higher revenue-making opportunities. In contrast, western gamblers gravitate toward dining and entertainment, which are less profitable to casinos.To be fair, the above narrative will require investors to ignore some ugly financial metrics that stemmed from Covid-19. However, the rewards could be robust. Right now, Wall Street analysts peg WYNN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $114.92, implying nearly 8% upside potential.Monster Beverage (MNST)Man in blue formal wear tuxedo standing as money 'rains' on him, isolated on red vivid background.Source: ShutterstockAn American beverage company, Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) specializes in energy drinks. Fundamentally, the company may benefit from the trade-down effect along with social normalization trends. Many companies have begun recalling their workers. However, as mass layoffs show, the economy isn’t holistically robust, meaning that people can’t be frivolous with their money.From this angle, Monster Beverage could represent a lower-cost alternative to getting coffee at a premium coffee shop or café. Onto the financials, Monster features a cash ratio of 2.66 on a TTM basis. In addition, the company benefits from excellent stability in the balance sheet. Notably, Monster has no debt, thus enjoying tremendous flexibility. Also, its Altman Z-Score comes out to a monstrous 28.77.Further, the enterprise enjoys strong revenue trends and excellent profitability metrics. As well, its return on equity (ROE) pings at a high of 17.48%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg MNST as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $113.64, implying over 9% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the cash-rich companies to consider.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)A man counts money he's holding.Source: ShutterstockAn internet and tech stalwart, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) routinely attracts attention and controversy. However, in 2022, the Class C GOOG stock suffered uncharacteristically sharp losses. It’s making up for lost time, gaining over 18% since the Jan. opener. However, in the trailing year, it’s down 25%. Still, despite the headwinds, Alphabet remains one of the cash-rich companies.In terms of raw numbers, Alphabet features a cash ratio of 1.64. Moreover, the tech firm enjoys a stout balance sheet. Notably, its equity-to-asset ratio pings at 0.7 times, above the sector median value of 0.65 times. As well, it features an Altman Z-Score of 9.8, indicating a very low risk of bankruptcy. Operationally, the enterprise continues to delight shareholders. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 22.9%, while its net margin dominates the sector at 21.2%.Looking to the Street, analysts peg GOOG as a unanimous strong buy. Further, their average price target hits $124.88, implying nearly 18% upside potential.Baidu (BIDU)Source: ShutterstockA Chinese multinational technology firm, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) specializes in Internet-related services and products. As well, it dove deeply into artificial intelligence, making Baidu one of the more intriguing tech enterprises. And while it’s off to a massive start to the new year (gaining over 31%), it posted a more modest 7% up in the past 365 days.To be sure, Baidu may generate some controversy because of the current geopolitical environment. Still, for politics-agnostic investors, Baidu represents one of the cash-rich companies. For starters, its cash ratio comes out to 2.19 on a TTM basis. Second, the company enjoys solid profitability. For example, its net margin is 6%, ranked above 62.48% of the interactive media industry. Also, it’s worth pointing out that the market prices BIDU at a forward multiple of 16.15. As a discount to projected earnings, Baidu ranks better than 63.16% of its peers.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg BIDU as a consensus strong buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $184.21, implying nearly 18% upside potential.Cameco (CCJ)Source: ShutterstockAlthough one of the riskiest names among cash-rich companies, Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) deserves consideration because of its relevant nuclear power business. With geopolitical flashpoints choking off western countries’ access to hydrocarbons, alternative sources of energy will likely take prominence. Nuclear power, despite its controversies, should reach front and center stage (eventually).For the adventurous investor, CCJ offers an enticing balance. For starters, the company’s cash ratio comes out to 3.64 on a TTM basis. Second, the company enjoys decent (though not great) stability in the balance sheet. Its debt-to-equity ratio is 0.17 times, favorably below the median stat of 0.27 times. Also, the company’s Altman Z-Score is 4.23, indicating low bankruptcy risk within the next two years.Admittedly, the company’s operational stats come off as rather lackluster or middling. However, as energy needs become more pronounced, CCJ could fly higher. At least, that’s what the analysts think, who pegged CCJ as a unanimous strong buy. Also, their average price target stands at $35.70, implying almost 49% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The company intends to completely recover the cost inflation experienced since 2021, with continued price hikes beginning in 2023. This is likely to strengthen its margins in 2023.Story continuesAcquisitions to Aid Top-Line GrowthThe company is also undertaking measures to grow business inorganically through value-creating acquisitions.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 1.42% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 5.16%.Coming into today, shares of the steel company had lost 11.47% in the past month. In that same time, the Basic Materials sector lost 1.62%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.27%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Nucor as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $4.13, down 46.15% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.26 billion, down 21.24% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $14.35 per share and revenue of $33.1 billion, which would represent changes of -50.16% and -20.26%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Nucor. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell).

Stocks are climbing the proverbial wall of worry as they often do.One of the best ways to get involved in the upside is to focus on stocks that boast high Zacks Ranks. The list identifies stocks with upwards trending earnings revisions and can significantly improve the odds of picking a market beating stock.The two stocks I feature below both have Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) recommendations, meaning their earnings expectations have been revised significantly higher. Additionally, they are both outperforming the broad market YTD.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCrocsCrocs CROX is one of the most popular footwear brands in the world. It is famous for its iconic clog made with extremely light and comfortable materials. The company offers a wide variety of footwear products including sandals, wedges, flip-flops and slides that cater to people of all ages. Crocs’ products are available in more than 80 countries and are distributed via wholesale, retail, and e-commerce platforms.Crocs stock has been a tremendous performer over the last five years, albeit a bit more volatile than the broad market. Over that time CROX has more than 6x’d investors’ money.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCrocs currently earns a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions.Sales for CROX in the current quarter are expected to grow 29% YoY to $853 million, while the current year sales are projected to see growth of 12.5% YoY to $4 billion. Earnings estimates for the current quarter have been revised substantially over the last 60 days, as have the current year and next year earnings expectations.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe most recent quarterly report, Crocs beat earnings expectations by 22%, and over the last four reporting periods it has beat every single time. The average earnings beat is 22% above expectations.Story continuesCROX is trading at a very appealing valuation as well. Its one-year forward earnings multiple is 10x, which is well below its five-year median of 21x, and below the market average 18x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNucorNucor NUE is a leading producer of structural steel, steel bars, steel joists, steel deck and cold finished bars in the United States. The company has 123 operating facilities most of which are in the U.S. and Canada and most of its customers are in North America. Nucor operates in three segments – the Steel Mills segment, the Steel Products segment, and the Raw Materials segment. Its steel products are used in highways, bridges, reservoirs, utilities, hospitals, schools, airports, stadiums, and high-rise buildings.Nucor has shown an impressive stock performance over the last 25 years. In that time, it is up over 2000%, for a 13% annualized return.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, NUE is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Sales and earnings are both expected to slow over the next few quarters. Current quarter sales are projected to slip by -21% YoY to $8.3 billion, and earnings are expected to fall -46% YoY to $4.13 per share.But earnings expectations have been revised considerably higher over the last two months. This is extremely important to note, because the market is forward-looking, and even though earnings are falling YoY, the expectations are improving considerably. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 15% over the last 60 days and current year earnings increased by 24% over the last 90 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNUE has a one-year forward earnings multiple of 10x, which is much lower than its 10-year median of 15x, and below the market average 18x. Nucor has a dividend yield of 1.4%, and the dividend payment has increased by 8.2% annually over the last three years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionMarkets go up and markets go down, but having a process will always be one way for investors to stay consistent. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks have shown over time that they outperform the market over the long term. While stock picking is extremely important to the investment process, it is also key that investors are very focused on risk management and following a plan. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

CCU, PVH Corp. PVH, Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. BBCP, Ranger Energy Services, Inc. RNGR and ePlus inc. PLUS.5 Value Stocks with Alluring EV-to-EBITDA RatiosThe price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple enjoys wide-scale popularity among investors seeking stocks trading at a bargain. In addition to being a widely-used tool for screening stocks, P/E is a popular metric to work out the fair market value of a firm. But even this ubiquitously used valuation multiple has a few downsides.While P/E enjoys great popularity among value investors, a less-used and more-complicated metric called EV-to-EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative. EV-to-EBITDA gives the true picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential. It has a more comprehensive approach to valuation.Compania Cervecerias Unidas S.A., PVH Corp., Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc., Ranger Energy Services, Inc. and ePlus inc. are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.EV-to-EBITDA is a Better Option, Here’s WhyEV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.The other component of the multiple, EBITDA, gives a better idea of a company’s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Usually, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more appealing it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could indicate that a stock is potentially undervalued.EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company’s balance sheet that the P/E ratio does not. Due to this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is generally used to value the potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks boasting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Story continuesP/E also can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. A firm’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. In contrast, EV-to-EBITDA is harder to manipulate and can be used to value companies with negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA front.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.However, EV-to-EBITDA is not devoid of shortcomings and alone can’t conclusively determine a stock’s inherent potential and future performance. The multiple varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital expenditure requirements.Therefore, instead of just relying on EV-to-EBITDA, you can club it with the other major ratios, such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S), to achieve the desired results.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that passed the screen:Compania Cervecerias Unidas is a multinational beverage company with diversified businesses and operations.

We are pleased to report that we drove strong fourth quarter financial performance ahead of expectations for both the top and bottom line, led by strength in our direct-to-consumer businesses. Revenue exceeded our expectations on both a reported and constant currency basis. And underlying growth, excluding the impact of currency and the Russia-Ukraine exit, was plus 9% in the fourth quarter driven by better-than-expected results for both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. We are coming into 2023 with strong momentum and expect to continue to grow our top line, led by outsized D2C growth while planning to deliver EBIT margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth.The growth in 2022 was driven by strong consumer response to our product, marketing and marketplace execution across both brands and across all regions. We showed that we were able to compete to win in what proved to be a much more challenging macro environment than any of us expected going into the year. And I would like to highlight some of the proactive choices we made to make that happen. Last April, we shared our long-term vision and multiyear growth plan at our Investor Day. The PVH+ Plan is our brand-focused, direct-to-consumer and digitally led growth plan that will over time build Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger into the most desirable lifestyle brands in the world and in parallel, making PVH one of the highest performing brand groups in our sector.The clarity of our direction and plan have provided a very strong focus for everyone in the company. We know where we are going, we know how we will get there and we made great progress in the first year of execution. This stronger execution focus is gaining traction across the company and we will continue into this year. In 2022, both Calvin and Tommy delivered increased strength in product with hero products across key categories and in our consumer engagement with cut-through campaigns, collaborations and world-class talent partnerships. This strength in product and consumer engagement is a big reason we drove high-quality plus 9% underlying revenue growth with increased pricing power. For 2022 from a regional perspective, Europe continued to grow from a position of strength in a challenging environment and delivered a very strong plus 10% growth in euros when adjusting for the Russia exit.In Asia, we are setting out to accelerate our growth. We were able to drive outstanding performance in the markets that were not in COVID lockdown, driving plus 11% constant currency growth for the total region and plus 23% constant currency growth outside of China. And in North America, we were able to start to win more with our domestic consumer, driving plus 9% growth for Tommy and Calvin together in a brand-accretive way, recognizing that this is the beginning of a multiyear unlock. From a supply chain perspective, we successfully navigated through the COVID-related challenges. Over the year, we increased our on-time deliveries from 60% to 95%, which have and will continue to deliver a positive impact on both availability and cost. And we are now about to unleash the next steps in building our supply chain to become a real strategic value driver.We are creating a strong data-driven sourcing approach that will return not only efficiencies and cost reduction opportunities but also enable us to invest back into great products. In addition, we are optimizing our SKU breadth to create higher productivity by cutting the unproductive assortment tail. We also came into the year knowing that an important underlying driver of the PVH+ Plan is to become more cost competitive in a way that simplifies how we work, increase our speed in decision-making and empowers our team to execute and enables us to drive new growth by making strategic investments in areas such as marketing, supply chain and technology. I'm pleased to share that we made significant progress here during the year. Perhaps the most important improvements we have made this past year was to continue to strengthen our management team with the capabilities needed to translate our PVH+ Plan to impact.From my experience, the strength of the leadership team is the single most important factor in successfully translating a value-creating plan into action and impact. I'm proud to share that we made significant progress in this critical area. Zac Coughlin joined as our CFO, David Savman as our Chief Supply Chain Officer, and Sara Bland as our Chief Strategy Officer. All 3 bring highly relevant experience and we are already seeing the positive impact from their leadership. And then as of this month, Eva Serrano joined as Calvin Klein Global President, having spent 20 years as one of the key leaders behind the growth of Zara and Inditex. And Donald Kohler joined as Calvin Klein America's President, having spent a big part of his career on the team that turned around Burberry, both from global roles and as Head of North America for them.With these appointments complementing our strong existing leadership team, we have the capabilities, experiences and the competitive mindset needed to deliver on our long-term PVH+ growth commitments. Finally, I spent a big part of my time in 2022 traveling to experience our markets and stores from the consumer's perspective. And I continue to be impressed by our people and teams around the world. I want to thank all of our associates for their hard work during 2022 and give a special recognition to our store managers. Their incredible work ethic, expertise and their passion to every day go out there and win with the consumer is an inspiration to all of us. Now turning to our regional performance and how we are connecting our brands and executing the PVH+ Plan across each region.Starting with Europe. Our Europe team continued to drive very strong performance, reflecting the power our brands have with consumers in the region. Despite macro headwinds, we really leaned into the business that finished the year strong. We delivered double-digit year-over-year growth for the fourth quarter and had another record quarter, exceeding EUR 1 billion in revenue. For the year, Europe also delivered double-digit underlying revenue growth adjusted for FX and our Russia exit, including growth in every quarter of 2022. Growth in the fourth quarter was led by our retail stores, which generated very strong performance during the holidays selling period. We also saw strong early wholesale shipments of spring 2023 collections, which have been very well received by our partners.Growth was enabled by better product availability, increased operational efficiencies and faster product deliveries. Our Tommy product strategy continues to be driven by product elevation, winning assortments and product stories true to the Tommy DNA, all with a focus on reaching the aspiration of consumer. This was supported by our hero product strategy, which was a strong enabler of growth in 2022. And in 2023, we are further increasing our category offerings and with that, amplifying our iconic products. For Calvin, we continue to leverage our proven playbook from Tommy to further build out Calvin as a lifestyle brand across product categories. We see strong growth momentum in footwear, accessories, next to our established Calvin Klein underwear and jeans businesses.We have seen favorable demand from consumers for our spring collection with unplanned early sell-through at wholesale. Looking ahead, adjusting for Russia and improved delivery performance compared to last year's supply chain disruptions, our shipped order book for fall is expected to be up low single digits. While our wholesale partners are taking a conservative approach, given the potential for macroeconomic volatility, we are well positioned to capitalize should stronger demand continue through our best-in-class operating model and strong never-out-of-stock program. Moving on to Asia Pacific. Our Asia team continued to deliver solid growth in constant currency in the fourth quarter outside of Greater China. In Greater China, we generated stronger-than-expected 11.11 performance, which was offset by the widespread COVID impact.For the year, the region generated strong double-digit constant currency growth. And both Calvin and Tommy continued to increase their brand awareness. Our focus on key growth categories and hero products and ongoing efforts to refine the products assortment through regionally relevant products with SKU rationalization are driving results. In the fourth quarter, our hero products outperformed with higher AURs and lower discounts. We continue to lean in and win key consumer moments such as Lunar New Year by driving engagement and performance above plan, fueled by successful product capsule launches and consumer activations. Both brands continue to move up the rankings on Tmall, underscoring the strength of our brands and product in the market and how well they are resonating with consumers.For the holiday, we launched the Tommy Miffy Capsule Collection, which feature the iconic cartoon character Miffy. The omnichannel campaign and capsule launch was brought to life across retail, social media, influencer collaborations and e-commerce partnerships, fueling strong brand heat. Calvin also launched a dedicated capsule and consumers had the opportunity to dress virtual avatars in the collection called Ready Player Me. As we look toward 2023, we are working to further expand the region's digital capabilities and to enable a single consumer view across channels as well as faster digital execution. We continue to make investments in newer channels such as Douyin live streaming and collaborations with the Tmall Innovation Center, which leverages big data and consumer insights to offer customized styles.We're also laying the foundation for new and enhanced capabilities in our supply chain through Asia for Asia sourcing, as well as improving our demand planning to focus increasingly on core replenishment and a read-and-react model to enable shorter lead times with higher in-season buying. Looking ahead, our brands have a clear premium brand and product positioning with the opportunity to grow further in all markets. We continue to lean into further increasing overall brand awareness, especially in China, where both Calvin and Tommy are underpenetrated. Lastly, shifting gears to our business in North America. Step by step, we are getting early traction in growing the business in a brand accretive way, underpinned by a clear category and product focus to deliver sustainable, profitable growth with an increased focus on the domestic consumer.Our Tommy and Calvin businesses delivered mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, led by our D2C stores. We delivered strong performance despite a very promotional holiday period, given elevated inventory levels across the market. For the year, our Tommy and Calvin businesses increased high single digits. Our D2C stores delivered high single-digit positive comps in the fourth quarter driven by improved product assortments and in-stock levels. Most importantly, we continue to drive improved domestic consumer comps. Our assortment and product improvements continue to yield results. For Tommy, our global bestseller initiative, which focuses on combining global winning design, scaled quickly to 70% of our D2C business. This initiative is generating higher AURs, stronger sell-throughs and higher gross margins compared to the balance of the assortment.One great example that we shared with you last quarter pertain to our expanding Polo business. Building on the prior quarter success in this key category, in the fourth quarter, our 3 biggest Polo product franchises were up plus 21% versus 2019. We also saw significant progress with on-time deliveries in the region with over 90% of our spring season on time compared to a year ago where we were just 32% on time at the start of the year. This improvement is a direct result of our improved supply chain leadership. Looking ahead to 2023, we are focused on applying our learnings from 2022 and further scale our growth initiatives in North America. We are doubling down on the performance drivers in our D2C stores through rigorous assortment billing and , even better matched to demand with a focus on in-stock improvements in key categories.For Tommy, we're expanding the Tommy global bestseller initiative to the wholesale channel. And for Calvin, we're building market share in CK underwear by improving replenishment execution and in-stock levels across all channels coupled with our impactful marketing execution. At the same time, we are making investments in store upgrades to ensure our stores deliver an elevated consumer experience. Next, I'll share a few global brand highlights and how we are bringing both brands to life for the consumer, beginning with Calvin Klein. Jonathan Bottomley, our global Calvin Klein CMO, and our Calvin marketing team have done a fantastic job in going back to the iconic DNA of Calvin Klein and made it highly relevant to today. During the past few months, we have been able to see this work come to life under the campaign umbrella of Calvins or nothing.In January, the campaign launched with global tennis star, Carlos Alcaraz, in our signature cotton underwear styles, wearing our classic straight jeans and it drove strong results. More recently, the spring chapter of the campaign was launched globally starring ambassadors and friends of the brand including Michael B. Jordan, Jennie Kim, Kendall Jenner, FKA Twigs and the Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Dressed in the latest underwear and jeans, the full cast introduced a wide range of new styles for the season. The campaign launched with Michael B. Jordan timed to the release of his highly anticipated film, Creed III. The campaign images quickly went viral across social media and generated very high engagement. The colab post between Calvin and Michael B.Jordan is now one of our highest performing post to date with a total reach of 8 million on OwnSocial. We saw incredibly strong organic broadcast and digital coverage across entertainment, pop culture and fashion outlets, including on Jimmy Kimmel Live! for a total reach of 1.3 billion in the 24 hours after launch. And the campaign pickup didn't stop there. The brand's colab post with Kendall Jenner is now the highest reaching post of the year with 13.4 million in reach, again, a testament to the power of the right imagery and the right talent to cut through. Also launching this week, Jungkook, a member of the extremely popular South Korean boy band, BTS, will join the brand as global ambassador for Calvin Klein jeans and Calvin Klein underwear.Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. Tommy, with its unique classic American cool DNA, continued to drive strong brand visibility and relevance among our target consumers. The brand generated approximately 4 billion impressions from November to January. Tapping into a moment of strong consumer relevance, the brand's Miffy collaboration, which I just spoke to, although developed for the Lunar New Year celebrations, was leveraged globally and it was one of our strongest performing capsules. Looking ahead, our Tommy spring campaign, Classics Reborn with Shawn Mendes recently launched globally. And as part of that, Tommy and Shawn just hosted a tour of immersive events in London, Berlin, Milan and Mexico City. Selected flagship stores held in-store activations.Sustainability stands at the heart of this collaboration with the collection incorporating a broad range of recycled and other sustainable materials. The Tommy Jeans label is also fostering new consumer connections through the upcoming Tommy Aries collaboration, which features a bold and creative play on all things Tommy Jeans. The collection is inspired by archival Tommy pieces and will, in the coming days, be available for early access online in our own stores and in key streetwear retailers globally. For both brands, we are looking forward to an exciting 2023. It will be a year to take another big step forward in delivering on our PVH+ commitments towards our long-term vision of building Tommy and Calvin into the most desirable lifestyle brands in the world, all while becoming one of the highest performing brand groups in our sector.I recognize the macroeconomic environment will likely continue to be tough. So we will be relentless in executing our 5 PVH+ growth drivers across both brands and all regions. In winning with products, we will advance our category offerings and create the best hero products in the market. In winning with consumer engagement, we will deliver seasonal cut-through campaigns charged by an increasingly strong network of aspirational talent. You will also see us improve the aspirational presence of all consumer touch points ranging from social media, e-commerce to in-store. We're also investing more into marketing as a share of sales to make sure we continue to cut through with our initiatives. In winning in the digital marketplace, we will continue to drive D2C offense across both the e-commerce and stores with improved productivity, all while we strengthen our partnership and business with our key wholesale partners and increasing our full price penetration.We are continuing to drive e-commerce strength, both owned and operated and with key partners. We are only in the beginning of developing our demand-driven supply chain. And this year, we will make progress in cost of goods, delivery accuracy and leveraging our scale across both brands, all while we take big steps to become cost competitive, going after efficiencies while investing behind our growth drivers. I look forward to building on the strong momentum we started in 2022 to win in 2023 and beyond. We are starting to get real traction around the vision, the plan, the execution and most importantly, the team and the mindset needed to get it done. Over time, there is enormous power in the compounded effect on being consistent in direction and value-creating focus through the PVH+ Plan.I'll now turn the call over to Zac to discuss the financials in more detail.Zachary Coughlin: Thanks, Stefan and good morning. My comments are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. As Stefan discussed, we are extremely pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and the full year, which significantly exceeded both our top and bottom line guidance, driven by strength in our European business and continued cost discipline globally. 2022 was a year of unprecedented macroeconomic volatility. And in this tough environment, we fought hard to win by focusing on what is within our control. Our ability to drive underlying revenue growth of 9% for 2022 and earnings per share of $8.97, in line with our initial expectations at the start of the year, approximately $9 per share, is a testament to our disciplined execution of our strategic priorities and the power of our 2 global brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.We are encouraged by the positive momentum we drove in the fourth quarter and are confident that we can deliver solid top line growth in 2023 while driving increasingly improved profitability. I will now discuss our 2022 results in more detail and then we'll move on to our outlook 2023. Our strong fourth quarter results delivered underlying revenue growth of 9% versus last year, exceeding our top line guidance by 4% on a constant currency basis. And we delivered earnings per share of $2.38, significantly exceeding our earnings guidance by $0.73. Our underlying revenue growth was driven by both our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands. We delivered strong revenue growth in Europe and continued growth in North America driven by the direct-to-consumer business.We continue to experience negative impacts in China from the COVID pandemic but the rest of Asia Pacific continued to drive growth in constant currency. On a reported basis, fourth quarter revenue was up 2%, which reflected a 6% negative impact from exchange and a 1% negative impact from the war in Ukraine. We continue to focus on driving performance in our direct-to-consumer business, where we have the closest connection to our consumer. And DTC was up double digits on an underlying basis driven by strong high single-digit growth in North America and mid-teens growth in Europe in euros. On a reported basis, DTC revenue was up 4% compared to last year, which reflected a 6% negative impact from exchange and a 1% negative impact from the war in Ukraine.From a regional perspective, fourth quarter revenue for our international business was up 11% versus last year on a constant currency basis, continuing to significantly exceed 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Within our international business, our European business had another record quarter following the first EUR 1 billion quarter in the company's history in the third quarter. Our Asia Pacific business was down 8% on a reported basis, including a 9% negative impact of exchange. Fourth quarter results in Asia Pacific were severely impacted as COVID cases in China rose following the lifting of restrictions there but saw improvement at the end of the quarter and into the first quarter of 2023. In North America, revenue in the fourth quarter was up 5% overall for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein with our retail store business up high single digits versus last year as we drove sequential improvement versus the third quarter in sales to domestic consumers.Our domestic comp sales are now up mid-single digits compared to 2019 levels. Our global brands also continued strong underlying growth, balanced across both brands, with Tommy Hilfiger revenues up 10% on a constant currency basis and Calvin Klein revenues up 8% on a constant currency basis. Reported revenues were up 3% for both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. In the fourth quarter, we delivered gross margin of 55.9%, up approximately 190 basis points compared to pre-pandemic levels but down approximately 240 basis points compared to last year. Gross margin reflected favorable region and channel mix compared to last year as well as planned price increases. Those benefits were more than offset by higher product costs, elevated ocean freight rates and increased promotional selling compared to last year as inventory levels are elevated across the industry.Later, I will discuss how some of these headwinds transition into tailwinds for 2023. SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue for the fourth quarter was 47.2%, down nearly 400 basis points from last year and better across all dimensions of the business. We continue to take a disciplined approach to managing expenses, driving cost efficiencies while making targeted investments in strategic areas to fuel growth, in line with the fifth growth driver of the PVH+ Plan. In total, EBIT for the quarter was $215 million, exceeding our expectations due to strong revenue performance and lower expenses. Operating margin was 8.6% as reported and 9% excluding the negative impact of approximately 40 basis points due to exchange. Earnings per share was $2.38 compared to $2.84 in last year's fourth quarter and exceeded our guidance by $0.73, almost entirely driven by the improvement in EBIT.Earnings per share for the quarter also included a $0.23 negative impact compared to the prior year related to exchange and a $0.13 negative impact due to the war in Ukraine. Excluding these 2 external factors, earnings per share was almost flat to prior year. Our tax rate was approximately 22%. As a reminder, in last year's fourth quarter, we benefited from noncash tax rate relief tied to our purchase of the Calvin Klein brand back in 2003. This benefit ran out in 2021. As a result, our tax rate in the fourth quarter of last year was a benefit of approximately 33%. Inventory was up 34% at the end of the quarter compared to the prior year period due to a combination of factors. As we've discussed, inventory levels were abnormally low in 2021 due to supply chain and logistics disruptions, which intensified in the second half of 2021.We have seen steady progress over the course of 2022 towards pre-pandemic production capacity and significantly improved delivery times. And in the fourth quarter this year, we experienced much earlier receipts of inventory as these supply chain and logistics disruptions had eased. This enabled us to capitalize on incremental top line opportunities in wholesale for the quarter but also contributed to the higher ending inventory levels. Absent the elevation due to timing of receipts, we have normalized back to inventory levels that support our planned growth. We also felt the full impact this quarter of higher product costs compared to last year. Looking into 2023, we expect cost to improve as we move through the year, particularly in the second half.We ended the full year 2022 with revenue of $9 billion and underlying revenue growth of high single digits aligned to our long-term financial algorithm and driven by growth in all regions and in both our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands. Our full year reported revenue was down 1% versus prior year and reflected a negative impact of 7% from exchange and 3% from the exit of Heritage Brands and the war in Ukraine. Operating margin was 9.5% and our tax rate for the year was 23.3%. Overall, we delivered earnings per share of $8.97, delivering our initial start-of-year guidance of approximately $9 per share. Additionally, we delivered on our commitment under the PVH+ Plan to return excess cash to shareholders, returning over $400 million to shareholders during the year through the repurchase of 6.2 million PVH shares and our dividend, including approximately $73 million for the repurchase of 1.1 million shares in the fourth quarter.Moving on to our outlook. In 2023, we expect to continue to execute our strategic priorities to unlock the full potential of our 2 global brands, Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein and as a result, drive strong financial performance across all regions. We ended 2022 strongly and are entering 2023 with momentum behind the PVH+ Plan. With that said, we acknowledge that macroeconomic uncertainties still exist with consumer sentiment tempered by inflationary concerns, particularly in North America and to a lesser extent in Europe and retailers planning cautiously due to elevated inventory levels industry wide. As such, we've approached our plans for 2023 with a healthy balance of optimism and prudence. We are projecting revenue growth in all regions with operating margin expanding to approximately 10% and earnings growing 11% to approximately $10 per share.For the full year, our overall revenue is projected to grow approximately 3% to 4% as reported and approximately 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis compared to 2022. This reflects a benefit of less than 1% from the 53rd week of 2023. Europe and North America are planned to grow low single digits with strong growth in our direct-to-consumer channel, tempered by wholesale as retailers remain cautious on buys. In Asia Pacific, plan to grow by low double digits as China has eased COVID restrictions. We expect our full year gross margin rate to increase over 100 basis points compared to 2022 despite approximately 100 basis points of higher cost due to exchange, which we have previously discussed. The improvement in our gross margin is supported by a favorable shift in channel and regional mix compared to 2022 as we accelerate growth in our higher-margin DTC business in line with our PVH+ strategies.And our DTC and international businesses make up a larger portion of total revenue. Additionally, we are seeing ocean freight rates coming down rapidly. We are using significantly less airfreight and abnormally high raw material costs will ease as we move through 2023, particularly in the second half of the year. SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue for the full year is expected to increase approximately 70 basis points compared to 2022. We continue to drive cost efficiencies across the business while targeting our investment focus on key areas that drive growth, especially marketing. We expect to generate increasing savings as we move through the year related to our plan to reduce people cost in our global offices by approximately 10% by the end of 2023.But these benefits are more than offset by the impact of regional and channel mix, which although favorable to our gross margin, carry higher expenses. We expect our full year operating margin will increase to approximately 10%, reflecting high single-digit EBIT growth. Interest expense is projected to be approximately $100 million and our tax rate for the year is estimated at approximately 24%. For the full year 2023, we are projecting earnings per share to be approximately $10, up 11% versus 2022. Looking at the balance sheet, we expect to build cash with a significant increase in cash from operations, reflecting an improvement in working capital due to lower inventories compared to 2022 as receipt flow normalizes. We are projecting capital spending of $350 million, which is approximately 4% of sales as we invest in our stores, supply chain and technology and in line with our PVH+ Plan priorities.We are also currently planning at least $200 million of share repurchases and will continue to review opportunities for capital deployment as we move through 2023. To zero in on the first quarter specifically, we expect to continue to be challenged by residual inflationary pressures and lingering macroeconomic uncertainties. Our overall revenue is projected to be relatively flat as reported and to increase by approximately 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. First quarter earnings per share are projected to be approximately $1.90, which reflects a negative impact of approximately $0.10 due to exchange translation. Our tax rate for the first quarter is estimated at approximately 24% and interest expense is projected to be approximately $23 million.Before I open up for questions, I just want to reiterate that we remain confident in our ability to win in a tough environment as evidenced by our performance in 2022. And while we expect the macro environment will continue to be volatile in 2023, we are continuing to focus on executing our strategies to drive top line growth, improve profitability and strong double-digit EPS growth in 2023. And with that, operator, we would like to open it up to questions.See also 21 Biggest Bankruptcies in American History and 10 Best Crypto Hardware Wallets In 2023.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"
23,0a9af241-c325-3c65-95dc-b3b63d4a90c6,PVH,2023-03-31,5 Value Stocks With Alluring EV-to-EBITDA Ratios to Own Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-value-stocks-alluring-ev-100610521.html,1680170770,STORY,"['PVH', 'BBCP', 'CCU', 'RNGR']","[The price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple enjoys wide-scale popularity among investors seeking stocks trading at a bargain. In addition to being a widely-used tool for screening stocks, P/E is a popular metric to work out the fair market value of a firm. But even this ubiquitously used valuation multiple has a few downsides.While P/E enjoys great popularity among value investors, a less-used and more-complicated metric called EV-to-EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative. EV-to-EBITDA gives the true picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential. It has a more comprehensive approach to valuation.  Compania Cervecerias Unidas S.A. CCU, PVH Corp. PVH, Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. BBCP, Ranger Energy Services, Inc. RNGR and ePlus inc. PLUS are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.EV-to-EBITDA is a Better Option, Here’s WhyEV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.The other component of the multiple, EBITDA, gives a better idea of a company’s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Usually, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more appealing it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could indicate that a stock is potentially undervalued.EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company’s balance sheet that the P/E ratio does not. Due to this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is generally used to value the potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks boasting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.P/E also can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. A firm’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. In contrast, EV-to-EBITDA is harder to manipulate and can be used to value companies with negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA front.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.However, EV-to-EBITDA is not devoid of shortcomings and alone can’t conclusively determine a stock’s inherent potential and future performance. The multiple varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital expenditure requirements.Therefore, instead of just relying on EV-to-EBITDA, you can club it with the other major ratios, such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S), to achieve the desired results.Story continuesScreening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks:EV-to-EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV-to-EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the stock is, as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that passed the screen:Compania Cervecerias Unidas is a multinational beverage company with diversified businesses and operations.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Cintas (CTAS) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this uniform rental company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Cintas is 16.6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 12.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 11.7%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Cintas is 6.5%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -0.5%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 18.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 11.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Cintas have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.2% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Cintas a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Cintas is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It has said it does not tolerate discrimination and takes allegations of workplace discrimination seriously.Hagan began working at the Raleigh store in June 2012 as a cashier, and rose to become a general merchandise support manager.The EEOC said Walmart demoted Hagan to deli sales associate in April 2018, one year after his seizures began, and fired him four months later after a supervisor had warned him to ""watch"" his absences.It said the seizures caused Hagan to lose consciousness, bite his tongue or have bowel movements, and the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer should have accommodated his requests for time off.""Employees with disabilities should be able to seek medical treatment without fear of losing their jobs,"" EEOC lawyer Melinda Dugas said in a statement.Both lawsuits accused Walmart of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act, and sought back pay and punitive damages.The case is EEOC v Wal-Mart Stores East LP, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of North Carolina, No. 23-00160.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Edward Tobin)]"

Evercore upgrading to outperform, touting the retail giant's scale and stability. Now, they also say that Walmart has gotten a hold of its 2022 inventory problems and views those issues of the past.Now, store traffic has also been trending to the upside. While it's still below those prepandemic levels, it's actually been increasing for seven quarters in a row right now. And success at Sam's Club is another thing that was called out in this report here by Evercore, with Evercore saying that the Club is building some of those loyalty brands that we know that is so important here for Sam's Club through its membership.It also thinks that it's going to continue to outperform as inflation remains sticky, at least for right now. So new price target $160-- still plenty of upside to go, at least Walmart thinks so. And it makes sense in this environment.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, there was a lot of positives in that note. They also pointed to web traffic, which is above prepandemic levels, above 2019, above 2020, a little bit lower than the last couple years, probably because more people are going back to the store.And another interesting graph in there, Dave, that kind of caught my eye was the groceries. We talked about that a lot at Walmart's-- after Walmart's last earnings. But groceries now for four quarters in a row, double-digit growth. It'll be interesting to see if that keeps going up because that is something that Walmart has that some of these other--- That the others don't, yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: --some of-- yeah, some of their competitors don't have when you talk about people trading down and buying groceries at Walmart.- And backing up the narrative, the National Retail Federation yesterday said they estimate retail sales increasing 4% to 6% this year. That is above the prepandemic average of 3.6%. But we'll get a better glimpse of Walmart investor day on April 4 and 4. That's next week.]"

Meanwhile, the retailer's app is also seeing an uptick in downloads. So far this year, downloads are close to 2 million, only slight lower than Amazon (AMZN), but higher than Target (TGT), Costco (COST) and BJ's (BJ).Now as consumers, including high-income shoppers, turn to Walmart for value amid inflation, the retail giant is getting a boost in foot traffic. While still below pre-pandemic levels, foot traffic, customers visiting the store, was up 2% in Q4. Same store sales? Up 8% and the average purchase was up 7%.""The traffic turn appears to be building, and with consumers across the demographic spectrum making wallet allocation choices after several years of record nominal retail spending, Walmart is poised to regain share,"" Melich said.Later in his note he said, ""Difficult times can also prove a catalyst for engaging new customers with Walmart, as Walmart’s core strengths in value and selection take on greater import (importance).""In the latest quarter, Q4, the crucial holiday period for retailers, total earnings came in at $5.81 billion, far higher than $3.6 billion in the year-earlier period. In the full fiscal year, total earnings came in slightly lower year-year-over. FY2023 saw $11.29 billion in total earnings. FY2022: $13.94 billion.Next week, Walmart is set to host its 2023 Investment Community Meeting. Melich said ""we might be early"" on these predictions, ""as the April analyst day could pose a risk if management tries to bludgeon the Street to their guidance range.""Story continues""That said,"" he added, ""with traffic momentum and margin expansion likely amidst a decelerating Retail world we like Walmart’s scale, balance sheet and stability.""Other reasons for optimism: Melich said Walmart's subsidiary, wholesale retailer Sam's Club, is ""building loyalty, traffic and renewal rates,"" making up 14% of sales. ""Sam’s comps (comparable sales) have averaged double-digits the past three-years,"" he said. Plus, Walmart's international profile, Walmex and Canada, also ""remain strong,"" making up 10% of sales, while China and India ""could see better sales and profit momentum as the world heals from COVID.""Store traffic on the up and up? A Miami Walmart. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (Joe Raedle via Getty Images)Shares of Walmart are up roughly 62% in the past five years. Still, Melich said buying in now could lead to a big return. Shares of the retail giant are outpacing the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC), which are up a little over 50% in the past five years.Melich is one of many bullish analysts on the Street when it comes to Walmart.

To see more such companies, go directly to Starter Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Stocks To Buy.Amid the current market turmoil which seems to have no end in sight, it feels weird to label anything as “safe,” especially stocks, which are spooking investors more and more, forcing them to pull money from the stock market and invest in other investment vehicles. A Wall Street Journal report earlier this month quoted  a survey from Bank of America, which said that fund managers’ allocation of stocks is now at about 2.2 standard deviations below its long-term average. The report said that instead of stocks, fund managers are gaining more exposure to bonds, emerging markets, cash and commodities.However, for those who are still interested in investing in the stock market, there’s almost a consensus among analysts that short-term market cycles should not blur your long-term outlook.""Don't Fear the Bear""According to an Edward Jones report titled “Don’t Fear The Bear,” from 1900 through 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) has had an average annual return of 9.9%, including dividends. The report said that investors should invest in quality stocks and should not worry about the short-term bear markets.“Instead of worrying about the timing of the next bear market, prepare your portfolio today with an appropriate mix of quality investments so you can stay invested in both bear and bull markets over time”When it comes to investment options for beginners, ETFs have gained a lot of popularity over the past few years, thanks to the wider exposure they provide to a basket of stocks with limited risks. One of the biggest benefits of investing in ETFs is that they give you exposure to a wide range of stocks in budget. Investing in ETFs also saves you a lot of money in transaction fees that comes with trading individual stocks. When you are investing ETFs, your transactions fees is limited when compared to stocks and mutual funds.Story continuesThe Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF is one of the most recommended ETFs for beginner investors since the ETF is composed of low-risk, high-quality stocks that are considered the safest. For this article, we scanned the top holdings of the ETF and picked 15 stocks that are considered the safest for beginner investors. We started from the top of the ETF’s holdings and picked stocks that are dominating their industries and have strong dividend histories. Given the current banking crisis and the volatility in the financial sector, we skipped banks and financial services stocks.The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors for each stock, which we took from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.Starter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To BuyPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To Buy15. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57With over 35 years of consistent dividend increases and a dividend yield of over 3.5%, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is one of the best and safest stocks to buy for beginners. Recently, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar increased the price target of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock to $206 from $200 and kept a Buy rating.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 57 hedge funds out of the 943 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). The total value of these stakes was $32 billion. A whopping $29 billion of these $32 billion stakes was owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.Carillon Eagle Growth &amp; Income Fund made the following comment about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)  in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Energy performed well during the fourth quarter, with the sector up about 23%. Investors returned to the sector after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) signaled it would reduce production. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) reported strong quarterly results while buying back stock, paying a healthy dividend, and maintaining a strong balance sheet.”14. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the best defensive stock picks for a recessionary environment according to several analysts. Last month, Citi started covering The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) with a Buy rating and a $68 price target. During the same month, Morgan Stanley kept an Overweight rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) but raised its price target to $70.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 58 hedge funds had stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) according to Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds. The biggest stakeholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  (NYSE:BRK-B) which had a $25 billion stake.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”13. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62With years of consistent dividend increases and a solid underlying business, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is one of the best picks for any starter stock portfolio.Recently, UBS ran a machine-learning model to select its top dividend picks. Unsurprisingly, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) made it to the list of these dividend stocks.The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) recently posted weak Q4 results. But several Wall Street analysts kept their optimistic view of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD). For example, BofA’s Elizabeth Suzuki said that The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)’s 2023 guidance may be overly conservative.The analyst expects home investment to remain above pre-COVID levels as she believes the “tailwinds for the home improvement industry are generally favorable.”Matrix Asset Advisors made the following comment about The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“During the quarter, we re-established a position in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) sold earlier this year, after the shares declined sharply on big picture concerns about a softer housing market and lower consumer spending. We believe that HD is a very well-managed company, positioned to continue showing good profits even as the economy decelerates. The products it carries in inventory are in year-round demand from contractors and homeowners wanting to maintain and improve their homes. The company has historically been shareholder friendly, repurchasing shares and increasing the dividend, most recently by 15% earlier this year. On September 30, HD’s current dividend yield was 2.8%.”12. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the stocks that remain stable even during recessions and high inflation. Recently, Bank of America said that food inflation could provide an upside potential to several grocery stocks and warehouse clubs like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST).At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 66 hedge funds had stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). The total value of these stakes was $3.4 billion.Madison Funds made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has raised its dividends consecutively for 50 years. The biggest retailer in the US has a stable business and long-term growth catalysts. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was among the “sleep at night” stocks picked up by BofA’s dividend growers screen recently.10. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73With several drugs in the pipeline and a solid dividend history, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is one of the best stock picks for starters. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a member of the S&amp;P Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks companies that have annually increased their dividend for at least 25 consecutive years.Earlier this year, Guggenheim started covering AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) with a Buy rating and a $172 price target.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 73 hedge funds had stakes in AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), according to Insider Monkey’s proprietary database. The total value of these hedge funds’ stakes was $1.5 billion. The biggest stakeholder of AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) was Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management which had a $229 million stake in the company.Alger Capital made the following comment about AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a global biopharmaceutical company that develops and markets drugs in areas such as immunology. virology and oncology. Recently, the company expanded through the acquisition of Allergan, which added robust growth assets to help offset the loss of U.S. patent protection for Humira, a leading treatment used for rheumatology, dermatology. gastroenterology, and ophthalmology. While AbbVie reported weak third quarter revenues across the board, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vraylar (an antipsychotic treatment) in December. Despite concerns around Humira’s loss of patent protection, we believe AbbVie has significantly diversified its revenue and that its launch of Rinvog for psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis could be promising.”9. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been upping its dividends for 66 years without a break. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) ranks 9th in our list of the safest stocks for starter stock portfolios.Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank selected The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as one of its top picks in the consumer packaged goods category.Another bullish call for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) recently came from JPMorgan, where analyst Andrea Teixeria upgraded the company shares to Overweight from Neutral.Out of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 74 hedge funds had stakes in The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). The biggest stakeholder of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates which had a $757 million stake in the company.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75What makes Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) an ideal pick for beginner investors looking for safe stocks is the company’s presence in several important healthcare sectors and a diversified business. Recently, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) said it will buy Seagen, an oncology-focused biotech company, for $43 billion.Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has a huge pipeline. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is making treatments for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular diseases in addition to making vaccines. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is also working on treatments for rare diseases like hemophilia, Huntington's disease, and sickle cell anemia.Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”7. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Pharma giant Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) ranks 7th in our list of the best starter stock portfolio picks. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has increased its dividend for over a decade now.Recently, Berenberg analyst Luisa Hector increased Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)’s price target to $130 from $125 and kept a Buy rating. The analyst believes Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has room to run after ""significant de-risking"" of the company's cardiovascular pipeline.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 77 hedge funds had stakes in Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), according to Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds.Artisan Value Fund made the following comment about Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a provider of health care solutions including prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, animal health and consumer care products. Shares have benefited from investors seeking safety in areas with less economic and interest rate sensitivity. With about one third of its sales generated by blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, the key issue for investors is the success of its large R&amp;D pipeline to replace those sales when Keytruda comes off patent in 2028. However, Merck seems to be getting little credit from investors for the 60+ programs it has in clinical development, despite having several solid and large new product opportunities. Additionally, the company’s strong balance sheet and robust free cash flow provide it multiple options for future partnerships and acquisitions, besides return of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.”6. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 79While Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) shares have seen a lot of see-saw movements this year, it remains one of the safest stocks for starters for several reasons. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is a solid dividend payer, and it is expected to continue seeing huge demand for oil in the years to come. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is also investing heavily in the clean energy sector to diversify its operations for the future. Its dominance in the industry gives it an edge over other, smaller players.Earlier this month, Mizuho increased its price target for Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) to $147 from $140 and kept a Buy rating on the stock. Click to continue reading and see Starter Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Stocks To Buy. Suggested articles:11 Most Promising Car Stocks to Buy11 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy TodayGraham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock PicksDisclosure: None.

Walmart receiving a rating upgrade from Evercore ISI. The firm bumping its rating on the retail giant from in-line to outperform, citing Walmart's traffic and margin's position for upside over the next two years.Take a look at shares here on the day for WMT. You're seeing them up by about 1 and 1/2%. And I think there are a few trends and quite economically cyclical that you can point to within Walmart, as well. And it's how the consumer engages with the brand like Walmart, whether that be on the grocery division or just some of the other discretionary divisions where Walmart has had to adjust some of its own inventory levels and be able to navigate this near term.But there's still this type of mindset or spending reversion that Walmart is a beneficiary of in times where there is more economic pressure where consumers will say, OK, yeah, I'll just go get everything from Walmart or use that as my own kind of discretionary spending hedge, as well. I do this myself. They've got great golf shorts for like $16 bucks.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, although, it's interesting here, this call seems to have less to do with the macro environment and more to do with the work that the management has done. And the first line of it is, ""It's time,"" of this note from Greg Melich. That basically they say-- he says, quote, ""Management's diligent work to pivot the business to omnichannel, divest noncore assets, and invest in productivity has positioned traffic and margins for upside over the next two years.""And he is talking about consumers making what he calls ""wallet allocation choices."" So there is that. But I think the call here is that management has well-positioned the company to take advantage of that. It's not just sort of the secular Walmart idea but that there are some specific things that they've been doing, which is kind of interesting here.They also talk about strength in Sam's Club, in particular, that that company has been building momentum. And that the international portfolio is relatively strong, as well.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, in terms of cyclical defensiveness as well, in '07 they said they remember buying all the Walmart that they wanted at 14x just before the stock outperformed and rerated to a big premium versus the S&amp;P 500. So that part of their bullish sentiment that they have appended to Walmart here on the day. And shares reacting.]"

Start your free 7-day trial of InvestingPro to get this news first.Walmart gets an Evercore upgradeWalmart (NYSE:WMT) was on the rise in premarket after Evercore upped the mega-retailer to Outperform from In Line with a price target of $160, up from the prior $145.The firm sees the potential for traffic and margins to expand over the next two years, a result of the “management’s diligent work to pivot the business to omnichannel, divest non-core assets, and invest in productivity.”“The traffic turn appears to be building, and with consumers across the demographic spectrum making wallet allocation choices after several years of record nominal retail spending, Walmart is poised to regain share,” Evercore analysts wrote in an upgrade note.WMT shares were recently up 1.6% in premarket trading Thursday.Fluence Energy upgraded at Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs upgraded Fluence Energy (NASDAQ:FLNC) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $29.00 from $25.00, driven by (1) better visibility on an improving gross margin trajectory and ability to achieve adjusted EBITDA break-even, (2) upside from IRA battery production tax credits, and (3) continued execution on high growth in the energy storage market.Shares are up more than 7% premarket today.Erasca initiated at Buy, shares surgeMizuho Securities initiated coverage on Erasca (NASDAQ:ERAS) with a Buy rating and a price target of $9.00, noting it likes the big pipeline of targeted drug candidates that can participate in the multi-billion market of precision drugs, and the willingness to acquire novel candidates such as the recent deal to add naporafenib to the pipeline.Although the shares have struggled this year due to the impact of the dilution from naporafenib deal, the firm finds the pipeline, potential markets, upcoming data points, and long cash runway to be highly attractive factors.Story continuesShares rose 8% yesterday and are trading more than 5% higher premarket today.Shoals Technologies upgraded to Neutral on a more balanced risk-rewardGoldman Sachs upgraded Shoals Technologies (NASDAQ:SHLS) to Neutral from Sell and raised its price target to $22.00 from $20.00.According to the firm, its previous Sell thesis was predicated on downside risks to consensus revenue/EPS expectations. Following Q4/22 results, it would appear consensus expectations and valuation have both come down significantly, and the firm sees a more balanced risk-reward profile now warranting a more Neutral stance on the stock.2 more upgradesJPMorgan upgraded Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) to Overweight from Neutral and raised its price target to $116.00 from $109.00.Canaccord Genuity upgraded Globus Medical (NYSE:GMED) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $67.00.Senad Karaahmetovic contributed to this report.Related Articles6 analyst picks of the day: Walmart stock pops, Fluence upped to Buy | Pro RecapAlphabet - near-term checks point to slightly better result for search in Q1, says Credit SuisseWall St gains as bank fears fade, focus on inflation data]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.The consumer discretionary sector took a hit last year as shoppers tend to cut back on discretionary spending when they feel the heat of inflation. As the Federal Reserve launched its rate hike onslaught to tame inflation, consumers started to tighten their belts. As of the end of 2022, the consumer discretionary subindex was down a whopping 37%, compared to a 19% decline of the S&amp;P 500 index. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 consumer staples subindex was down just by 2.7% in the period.However, the consumer discretionary sector started to post a comeback this year as the market saw a strange optimism. As of February 7, consumer discretionary was one of the top-performing sectors of the S&amp;P 500 in 2023.While the Federal Reserve has indicated its plan to keep raising interest rates in 2023 amid rising inflation and a strong labor market, some believe consumer spending will remain strong. Retail spending in January jumped 3% from December on a seasonally adjusted basis. This spending growth was surprisingly boosted by vehicles, furniture, clothing and dining out. According to a Wall Street Journal report, Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, believes consumer spending will remain strong as long as labor market, wage growth and savings rates hold up.While consumer discretionary sector is sensitive to interest rate hikes, the industry is full of companies that are paying attractive dividends. These companies are expected to benefit in the long term when the market begins to recover. That’s why investing in consumer discretionary dividend stocks which have strong yields and dividend safety is a decent bet for long-term investors.Best Consumer Discretionary Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/Story continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their stock holdings as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 and picked 15 consumer discretionary dividend stocks that had the highest number of hedge fund investors.

(NYSE:AAP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also found an opportunity to add to our existing position in Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) as the stock fell and the risk/reward profile improved. Advance underperformed early in the quarter as lower-quality sector peers bounced significantly. In August, shares fell further after the company reported second quarter earnings that disappointed because of weakerthan-expected same-store sales. Furthermore, management reduced its full-year earnings outlook by ~4%, citing softening consumer purchasing patterns within AAP’s “do-it-yourself” business.The most important driver of Advance Auto’s earnings power seems to be the management team’s ability to improve margin expansion. However, the market remains myopically focused on sales growth. The margin expansion opportunity originates from the consolidation of an overly complex and inefficient distribution network. Management is planning to roll out new distribution center. software through 2023 that will reduce costs, improve network productivity, and enhance customer experience through better inventory availability.In addition, the auto parts retailing industry tends to be less cyclical than the Consumer Discretionary sector because consumers often hold onto their used cars longer and make necessary repairs rather than buy new vehicles when their financial prospects are weakened. AAP is currently trading at less than 12 times forward earnings, well below the company’s long-term median P/E of more than 15—while having significant room to improve profitability owing to its self-help initiatives.”7.

The sales growth was driven by strong demand of its F-150 trucks.Here is what Leaven Partners has to say about Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance.

Today, the Baltimore based apparel brand extending their deal with Warriors star Steph Curry to what's expected to result in one of the richest endorsement deals in sports history and what could amount to a lifetime deal. As part of the agreement, Curry becomes the President of Under Armour's Curry brand, and he'll work on golf, youth sports, sports style, in addition to basketball.The two time MVP, four time NBA champ initially signed with Under Armour in 2013 for around $4 million per year. His current contract is worth a reported $215 million, expires in '24, and includes equity in Under Armour. And that, of course, is the key.Said the founder of Under Armour, Kevin Plank, I couldn't imagine under Armor without Steph, nor Steph without Under Armour. Shares relatively flat today and down 5%-plus this year, 47% over the last 12 months as they try to compete with Nike. There are reports from ""Rolling Stone"" that this is what equates to a $1 billion deal with Steph Curry, but, again, no numbers from Under Armour. And, of course, it depends on what that equity is worth.The real question is, Josh, how much of a difference maker is he? Because, look, Steph Curry, and I'm not afraid to say that he has changed the game of basketball more so than Michael Jordan. And people can get mad at that all they want. He has changed it at every level-- youth, high school, college, the pros.He's changed everything we know about the game fundamentally-- again, more than Magic, more than Jordan. But will the shoes move the needle? We're not going to compare it to the Jordan brand, because they did $5 billion in revenue 25 years after Jordan retired.- The key here is going to be can, they make Steph Curry cool from a lifestyle perspective? I think right now, Steph Curry's shoes are cool to wear on the court and his basketball shoes are pretty popular. But he hasn't had that Jordan effect where once he retires, people don't wear shoes of retired guys on the court anymore. That's not really that cool for kids.Story continuesSo you've got to get to the lifestyle part of it. I think the golf tie-in is pretty cool. Steph Curry is a big golfer. He'll probably have a presence in the golf game post his career. But I don't know, Seana, I was surprised about the amount of athletes that you kind of can't name that are sponsored by Under Armour.And it's not like the Nike group that I think is kind of famous and really drives a lifestyle brand. We were looking them up earlier and some of the names are like, they're sponsored by Under Armour? I didn't remember that.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, they caught us a little bit offguard. We didn't even realize that. That's so true. And I think part of this deal and part of the reason why Under Armour is keeping Steph Curry is also just his ability to attract other very large name, well known athletes that Under Armour is hoping they will be able to come out with their own lines, they will be able to attract that user base.Because look at the numbers, look at their performance over the last several years. The company continues to struggle. We know inventory has been a massive issue for us Under Armour. They have been promoting as much or if not even more than some of their competitors out there. So huge win, I think, for Under Armour-- obviously, with that potential payday makes sense for Steph Curry too.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, it'll be interesting. I think it's a similar question that Adidas faces with arguably the most famous athlete on the planet, which is Messi. Can he translate, can they develop an off the field shoe? Neither have really made much of an effort or had success off the field. That may be the key.- It's just crazy, quickly, when you think about it, if I had told you a decade ago that Under Armour got Steph Curry before the Warriors won all those championships and before he got this big, you would think they'd have a bigger presence in basketball, wouldn't you?DAVE BRIGGS: No question about that.SEANA SMITH: That's true. He's so likable too.- Right. No, Steph Curry is awesome. The Warriors are-- they're fun to watch. And it just hasn't taken off to that level.]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Climate Change Stocks To Invest In.As governments around the world push for a greener future, climate investing is gaining popularity. Companies are finally starting to understand the enormous opportunities in the sustainable investment sphere. Data shows that funds that focus on sustainable investing managed to perform well in 2022, when the broader market faced a huge turmoil amid the macroeconomic situation. According to a Wall Street Journal report, investments in sustainable funds in the US, including stocks, bonds and other categories, fell to $3.1 billion in 2022 from $69.2 billion a year earlier. This decline seems paltry when compared to conventional funds (funds that don’t take into account ESG when investing) which suffered a whopping $370 billion worth of withdrawals in 2022.The WSJ report added that 75% of the total inflows seen by sustainable funds in 2022 were from fixed-income funds, a surprise when seen in the context of the rising interest rate environment.The Importance of Climate InvestingAs humanity inches closer to a point of no return in terms of carbon emissions, climate-focused groups in investing circles are voicing their concerns and pushing companies to start paying more attention to ESG when taking decisions. Investor Group on Climate Change recently warned in a report that in order to avoid “catastrophic” long-term risks, money managers will need to make an effort to measure the physical impact of climate change across their portfolios, according to Bloomberg.

The company’s solutions and technology continued to enjoy strong global demand as public utilities, as well as industrial, commercial and residential clients, seek solutions to treat, test, transport and preserve water. Similar to other industries, Xylem’s business has been impacted in the short term by the effects of inflation and chip‐supply constraints (that are now moderating), leading to an increasing backlog that has delayed the ability to fulfill orders. We believe Xylem’s portfolio of highly differentiated pumps, recognized for their quality and critical uses, as well as the company’s ability to cross‐sell and link other products, such as sensors and smart meters, will make it a one‐stop shop for utilities and protect the company from pure price competition. In our opinion, long‐term trends, such as water scarcity and the need to replace aging water infrastructure, create strong underlying demand for Xylem’s products through various parts of the economic cycle.”10.

Both companies should also benefit from the IRA as they enable greater energy efficiency in a variety of settings: Regal Rexnord innovates through best-in-class engineering capabilities to help customers achieve their energy efficiency objectives; Trane’s products enable lower energy demand and emissions in HVAC systems and buildings, where it estimates ~15%–25% of all GHG emissions are emitted.According to ClearBridge holding Trane Technologies, under ideal conditions, a heat pump can transfer 300% more energy than it consumes. In contrast, a high efficiency gas furnace is only about 95% efficient. Further, heat pumps are powered by electricity, creating substantial potential fuel savings. Assuming the electricity comes from clean energy sources, heat pumps are also much more “green.”Heat pumps gained prominence in June when President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act of 1950 to call for more domestic production of heat pumps to reduce American energy bills, fight climate change and free up U.S. natural gas to support allies in Europe. The IRA, which provides $500 million in funding for expanding production of heat pumps as well as processing critical minerals, should be a plus for manufacturers and ClearBridge holdings like Trane and Johnson Controls (JCI).”6.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 67% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$16b in market cap. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 2.7%.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of MGM Resorts International, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for MGM Resorts International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About MGM Resorts International?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in MGM Resorts International. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of MGM Resorts International, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in MGM Resorts International. Our data shows that IAC Inc. is the largest shareholder with 17% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.1% and 6.6% of the stock.Story continuesWe also observed that the top 10 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of MGM Resorts InternationalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that MGM Resorts International insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$96m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over MGM Resorts International. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 17% of the MGM Resorts International shares on issue. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

Brent futures for May delivery, which will expire upon settlement later on Friday, rose 44 cents or 0.6% to $79.71 a barrel.West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) for May delivery rose $1.11, or 1.5%, to $75.48 a barrel, having gained about 8% so far this week.Data on Friday showed the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 0.3% in February on a monthly basis, compared with a 0.6% rise in January and an expectation of a 0.4% rise in a Reuters poll.Signs inflation is slowing tend to support oil prices as this could point to less aggressive interest rate hikes from the Fed, lifting investor demand for risk assets like commodities and equities.Oil prices were also buoyed after producers shut in or reduced output at several oilfields in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region of northern Iraq following a halt to the northern export pipeline.With prices recovering from recent lows, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia are likely to stick to their existing output deal at a meeting on Monday, sources said.OPEC pumped 28.90 million barrels per day (bpd) this month, a Reuters survey found, down 70,000 bpd from February. Output is down more than 700,000 bpd from September.If current levels hold, oil prices will record their second straight week of gains, but Brent and WTI were also set to record monthly declines of 5% and 2% respectively, their steepest since November.The benchmarks hit their lowest since 2021 on March 20 in the wake of large bank failures, and while they have recouped some of the losses since then, they remain well below the levels at which they were trading at the start of March.""The prolonged economic scarring of the last month will likely slow the economy, if not cause a recession, and lower interest rate expectations are not enough to support oil prices in the short term,"" said Craig Erlam, senior markets analyst at OANDA.(Reporting by Shariq Khan; Additional reporting by Shadia Nasralla, Sudarshan Varadhan and Andrew Hayley; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Jan Harvey)]"

Each of the last four U.S. administrations has grappled with an economic crisis serious enough to warrant government intervention. The current banking crisis comes just three years after the Covid-19 pandemic triggered global supply chain disruptions, which itself came a little more than a decade after the 2008 financial crisis.Unfortunately, energy is one of the sectors that have historically been hammered the most whenever the economy ails. Economic downturns including recessions tend to have a pronounced negative impact on the oil and gas sector, leading to steep decline in oil and gas prices as well as contraction in credit. Falling oil and gas prices means lower revenues for oil and gas companies and tight credit conditions that result in many explorers and producers paying higher interest rates when raising capital, thus crimping  earnings even more.Whereas quick action by the U.S. government appears to have stabilized the banking sector, some experts are warning that we are not out of the woods yet.Former PIMCO chief Mohamed El-Erian has criticized the Federal Reserve's delayed action to control inflation, and says the central bank's ""least bad"" option is to immediately  pause its interest rate increases,""The degree of economic contagion that resulted from this mishandled interest rate cycle is going to be significant because there are two different drivers here. One is banks themselves getting more conservative and two is banks expecting regulation to get tighter. The regulators and the supervisors have been embarrassed and the response has always been tighter in regulation even though this is a failure of supervision more than a failure of regulation,"" El-Erian has told CNBC.Let’s examine how energy markets have reacted to past economic and financial crises.The Great Depression of 1930The opening of giant oil fields in the United States in the years heading into the Great Depression of 1930 led to an enormous glut and sent prices crashing to just 13 cents per barrel (~$5.40 today adjusted for inflation).Story continuesIn October 1929, U.S. commercial crude stocks hit a staggering 545 million barrels, thanks to the discovery of several massive oil fields in Oklahoma, Texas, the rest of the Southwest and California. Back then, that was the equivalent of 214 days of production; for some perspective, U.S. crude oil stocks were 845.27M for the week ending March 24, equivalent to ~42 days of production.The first gusher came online in 1926 in Oklahoma’s Seminole field, yielding 136 million barrels annually, or 10% of the entire U.S. oil output. A deluge of new discoveries in Oklahoma City, Yates field (West Texas), Van (East Texas), Signal Hill in California, and the super-giant Long Beach Oilfield within Greater Los Angeles quickly put an end to the peak oil fears prevalent in the early 1920s.Related: WTI Crude Gains As Banking Fears Ease, Kurdish Oil Exports Remain SuspendedBy the summer of 1931, East Texas field alone was pumping 900,000 barrels per day from approximately 1200 wells, up from virtually zero just a few months prior. Unfortunately, too much oil flooded the markets and, compounded with low demand during the depression, triggered a dramatic oil price crash, with prices plunging from $1.88 per barrel in 1926 to $1.19 in 1930 and eventually 13 cents a barrel in the throes of the depression in July 1931.Oil Shock of 1973/74The oil shock of 1973/74 is regarded as one of the most important oil crises after an oil embargo by Arab producers against the U.S. deepened the financial crisis of the early 1970s. In this case, it was high oil prices that actually triggered a severe economic crisis.On October 19, 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) slapped an oil embargo on the United States in response to President Nixon’s request to Congress to make available $2.2 billion in emergency aid to Israel for the Yom Kippur War. Consequently, OAPEC nations stopped all oil exports to the U.S., and started production cuts that lowered global oil supply. These cuts nearly led to a supply crunch and quadrupled the price of oil to $11.65 a barrel in January 1974 from $2.90 a barrel before the embargo. The embargo was eventually lifted in  March 1974 amid disagreements within OAPEC members regarding how long it was to last.As the then Fed chair Arthur Burns observed, the embargo and manipulation of oil prices had come at most inopportune time for the United States. By the middle of 1973, prices of industrial commodities were already rising at more than 10% p.a. Industrial plants were operating at virtually full capacity leading to deep shortages of industrial materials. Meanwhile, the  U.S. oil industry lacked excess production capacity, leading to wide oil deficits and fuel shortages everywhere.To make matters worse, OPEC was gaining significant market share while non-OPEC sources were in deep decline. This allowed OPEC to wield much more power and influence over the price setting mechanism in global oil markets. Following the devaluation of the dollar, OPEC nations resorted to pricing their oil in terms of gold and not USD, leading to a wild gold rally from $35 an ounce to $455 an ounce by the end of the 1970s.Ultimately, the oil crisis of 1973 and the accompanying inflation triggered a U-shaped recession characterized by a prolonged period of weak growth and economic contraction.The Oil Price Crisis of 1998–9 The oil price crisis of 1998/99 was the opposite extreme of what Americans who had lived through the oil price surges during the 1970s were accustomed to, with the Asian financial crisis triggering a dramatic decline in prices.The collapse of the Thai baht in the summer of 1997 marked the beginning of the oil price crash and led to the stock markets crashing 60%. Consequently, oil demand in Asia, a pillar of global demand, pulled back sharply with demand in other parts of the world also slumping. To exacerbate matters,  OPEC production continued unhindered at a time when Iraqi oil had returned to global markets for the first time since the Gulf War. Indeed, Iraq nearly quadrupled production from just shy of 600k barrels per day in 1996 to 2.3 mb/d in 1998.Just as oil prices started to sink In November 1997, OPEC ministers agreed to raise their production quota by 2 million barrels per day on the erroneous assumption that global demand would continue to accelerate at the same clip it had in the few years prior to 1997 at the height of the Asian economic miracle. It was not long before OPEC realized it had got its timing horribly wrong and lowered production quotas several times in 1998 in a bid to arrest the oil price decline. But several members, most vociferously Venezuela, were loath to lose market share and refused to co-operate with swing producer Saudi Arabia. Not surprisingly, prices crashed 40% between October 1997 and March 1998 to $10 per barrel, with some grades going as low as $6 by the end of 1998 amid OPEC squabbling.For American drivers, the oil price crash was Eden, and car buyers embraced sport utility vehicles and trucks over smaller cars. Brands like Ford Expedition Lincoln Navigator suddenly could not keep up with demand.“Bigger may or may not be better, but automakers are scrambling to build the behemoths Americans will buy,” the New York Times reported.The Global Financial Crisis Of 2008The financial crisis of 2008-2009 is regarded as the biggest to hit the globe so far this century. The crisis started in the real estate market in 2006 and was marked by a sharp increase in defaults on subprime mortgages. Although the first wave of the crisis was contained, it  severely curtailed economic activity as the contagion spread throughout the economy. Commodity prices climbed sharply even as the housing market collapsed.The crisis eventually triggered a wave of deflation and liquidation that took values of all assets, including oil and gas, lower. Oil prices crashed from $133.88 per barrel in June 2008 to $39.09 in February 2009 while natural gas prices fell from $12.69 per MMBtu to $4.52 over the timeframe.Thankfully, the crisis came to an end a year later thanks to aggressive stimulus employed by governments that led to expectations of increased inflation, which in turn triggered an increase in commodity buying as well as an improvement in credit conditions.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Climb As Iraq's Dispute With Kurdistan EscalatesPetroChina Sees Chinese Fuel Demand Rising By 3% From Pre-Covid LevelsMercedes Signs Deal With Spanish Renewables GiantRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

It was running out of oil that can be extracted with a low carbon footprint.The report shined the spotlight on an issue that tends to get overlooked in the daily discourse on climate change and the fossil fuel industry—the fact that not all oil is created equal.While it would be overly optimistic to suggest that any environmentalist would back an oil project, it might be worth considering the differences between oil projects that make some less polluting than others. Because in a discourse focusing exclusively on emissions, these differences matter.Take the Willow project that President Biden approved earlier this month. The approval, which goes directly against Biden’s campaign promises to squeeze the oil industry, caused an expected stir among environmentalists. Yet some commentators pointed out that it might not be a certain disaster.Indeed, like all oil projects in the United States, Willow will be subject to strict environmental impact rules, and there is no doubt these rules will be enforced enthusiastically. And this means that ConocoPhillips will make super sure it develops those resources responsibly and with as little emission footprint as possible.Related: $11 Trillion Investor Group Urges Members Not To Fund New Oil And Gas ProjectsOr how about gas flaring, which releases substantial amounts of methane—another greenhouse gas—into the atmosphere? Methane has been garnering growing attention from both activists and regulators, and this attention is beginning to produce results.Exxon said earlier this year it had stopped routine flaring at its wells in the Permian and expressed hope that other producers would follow its example. Even if they don’t, however, flaring in Texas has dropped precipitously over the last decade or so –while oil and gas production grew in leaps and bounds.Story continuesStrict environmental regulation and the readiness to implement it can do wonders for an industry’s level of responsibility. Gas flaring and new drilling are only a couple of examples of this. So is carbon capture.Last year, Canada’s biggest oil producers said they would spend some $16.5 billion on carbon capture by 2030. That sum would make up the bulk of a planned emission-reduction investment of $24.1 billion by the six biggest oil producers in the country.Environmentalists don’t like carbon capture. In fact, many dislike it intensely, claiming it is too expensive to make economic sense and that it would only motivate more oil and gas production instead of depressing it.The second part of this claim is probably true. The first—probably not so much, at least from the perspective of an oil producer. The industry is being hounded into virtually giving up its business because it is the new Devil. For that industry, carbon capture may very well become—or has already become—the means to survival, so they will gladly invest in it to reduce their greenhouse gas footprint.In Canada, the Pathways Alliance, as the group of large oil producers has called itself, plans to capture and store some 10 million tons of carbon dioxide from more than 20 oilsands projects in northern Alberta. In Texas, Chevron is working on a carbon capture hub and just announced a plan to triple the size of the facility.Again, these are just a handful of examples showing that not all oil projects are equal. Some are, if not better, then certainly less bad for the environment than others. Of course, the United States and Canada are not the only places where oil is being extracted responsibly.The carbon footprint of an oil project also involves the purely technical process of extraction, which, depending on the geology, could be more or less energy-intensive and, as a result, emission-intensive.Take Guyana, for example. A new kid on the oil block, a tale of rags to riches in a few short years as Exxon and Hess make discovery after discovery offshore the tiny South American nation. Offshore oil is not the cheapest kind, for sure. Yet Guyana’s offshore oil breakeven level is around $30 to $35 per barrel. For Exxon’s second development site currently in operation, this has fallen to $25.There is also Saudi Arabia—until recently, the world’s largest oil producer sporting the lowest breakeven prices in the world. As the emissions narrative gathered pace and volume, the Saudis have started adding to that the claim that their oil is also low-carbon—and that’s precisely because of that low breakeven. The less energy you use to develop a natural resource, the less emission-intensive that development is; it’s as simple as that.Of course, it would be too much to think that any environmentalist activist would embrace low-carbon oil projects. The very nature of oil makes it the enemy of the activist. The only good oil as far as activists are concerned is the oil that stays in the ground.Yet because the way the world works is far from perfect, oil continues to be taken out of the ground to be used in multiple ways, including for making the synthetic fiber used for the production of high-visibility jackets that environmentalist activists like to wear during their road blockades.It might be wise to divert some of the attention focused on the oil industry from the fact of its existence to the ways it is changing to accommodate higher environmental standards—and reducing its emission footprint in the process.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Kurdistan’s 400,000-Bpd Oil Exports Still Shut-In As Talks With Iraq FailOil’s Low Prices Draw Rash Of HedgingShell Cancels Singapore Aviation Biofuel ProjectRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

69,d46a81be-9211-3e5c-a08b-34c3c582ca03,FE,2023-03-31,All You Need to Know About FirstEnergy (FE) Rating Upgrade to Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-firstenergy-fe-rating-upgrade-160004769.html,1680192004,STORY,['FE'],"[FirstEnergy (FE) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for FirstEnergy basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for FirstEnergy imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for FirstEnergyThis utility company is expected to earn $2.50 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 3.7%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for FirstEnergy. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1.4%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of FirstEnergy to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, FirstEnergy has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while NextEra Energy has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that FE has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.FE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.75, while NEE has a forward P/E of 24.38. We also note that FE has a PEG ratio of 2.44. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. NEE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.70.Another notable valuation metric for FE is its P/B ratio of 2.11. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NEE has a P/B of 3.13.These metrics, and several others, help FE earn a Value grade of B, while NEE has been given a Value grade of D.Story continuesFE has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than NEE, so it seems like value investors will conclude that FE is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

71,016300fe-cedb-3e26-85ee-65faeddc5674,CRM,2023-03-31,"Marc Benioff says he can juggle empathy, cost cuts, and layoffs as he doubles down on efficiency at Salesforce",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/m-willing-bullets-marc-benioff-153000800.html,1680190200,STORY,['CRM'],"[Marc Benioff, cofounder and CEO of Salesforce, has taken a lot of hits in recent months. First, activist investors went after him, attacking his expensive taste in acquisitions and agitating for greater efficiency at the enterprise software maker. Then, his employees lashed out: After about 8,000 of them were laid off in January, many of those who remained took to Slack—ironically, one of Benioff’s expensive acquisitions—to complain that the company’s touchy-feely culture was just a facade.“I’m willing to take the bullets and the cuts and the vilification,” Benioff, 58, tells me during a wide-ranging interview that took place via phone while he was on a flight to the East Coast. “That’s what you have to do as CEO, especially through difficult times.”Luckily for Benioff, at least the numbers have been kind: In early March, Salesforce released its most recent quarterly results, beating analyst estimates and setting better-than-expected projections for its next fiscal year. Revenue in the company’s last quarter was up 14% year over year while adjusted margins (excluding things like $828 million in restructuring charges) rose to 29.2%, the highest in its 24-year history.The earnings report was good news for Benioff and for his company’s stock price. But that doesn’t mean the longtime tech leader is in the clear. For starters, the current era of economic uncertainty is far from over, and activists are still pushing Benioff not just to keep increasing profits but to prove he can put a viable succession plan in place. (In yet another recent gut punch, former co-CEO and heir apparent Bret Taylor left in January; Benioff called the resignation “bittersweet.”) Then there’s the other, even more legacy-shaping test of his mettle: Over the past few years, Benioff has become the poster child for stakeholder capitalism—the idea that financial stockholders are not the only interests a business should consider. That was fine when those stakeholders were happy and the economy was growing.Story continues“It’s much harder when things are contracting than when things are expanding,” Benioff says of bringing people into his view of the world and business’s role in it.Indeed, Benioff now finds himself having to listen to—and prove that he can answer—stakeholders with all sorts of new demands. His ability to navigate these loud voices, from employees asking for more flexible work-at-home policies to shareholders agitating for leaner operations, will prove to be a useful case study not just in Benioff’s style of “empathetic” leadership. In many ways, it could also serve as a referendum on the whole model of stakeholder capitalism.Benioff insists he’s just as committed to the ohana (Hawaiian for “family”) culture he has cultivated at Salesforce. But he also admits that there are new challenges for CEOs. The hardest part of being a leader today, says Benioff, is “explaining the unexplainable,” a line he has now used in several interviews. What does that mean? It boils down to this: Justifying layoffs, especially after more than a decade of economic growth, is hard. Even for a gifted marketer. That’s why Benioff now finds himself having to sell his toughest product yet—that austerity, which investors are clamoring for, can coexist with ohana. “It [layoffs] is something that you never want to have to do, but everybody knows you have to do it, because it’s just the nature of business,” says Benioff, and then quickly adds: “But that doesn’t mean that you can’t have a great company, and that you can’t be a great place to work.”Benioff is trying to tell me that these are challenging times for business leaders—a common CEO mantra in today’s climate. At least, that’s what I think he’s trying to tell me. As is typical in conversations with the always-loquacious Benioff, the conversation soon takes a sharp turn to the philosophical.“I think you have to have, as the Japanese say, shoshin, or beginner’s mind,” the CEO tells me. “As the leader, you have to realize that the past is gone, and that you’re going to have to create a new future. But it also means that the kind of leadership notion that you’ve had in the past is also gone. In the expert’s mind, there are few possibilities, but in the beginner’s mind, there’s every possibility.”To be sure, the recent layoffs at Salesforce weren’t the first in its history. In 2000, when the dotcom bubble burst, Benioff laid off 20% of his workforce (and Salesforce has had small “adjustments” since). But that was before the company was public, back when it employed only 100 workers. It was also around the time that Benioff launched the company’s 1-1-1 model, which dedicates 1% of the company’s equity, 1% of its product, and 1% of employees’ time to philanthropic causes. The CEO has long championed business as the “greatest platform for change.” But he really solidified his role as one of the lead evangelists of the stakeholder capitalist movement during the pandemic.“In the pandemic, it was CEOs in many, many cases all over the world who were the heroes,” Benioff told a remote audience during the 2021 World Economic Forum gathering, which took place online instead of in the snowy mountain town of Davos, Switzerland. “They’re the ones who stepped forward with their financial resources, their corporate resources, their employees, their factories, and pivoted rapidly—not for profit, but to save the world.”Benioff, along with a team of other big-name execs, helped procure 50 million units of personal protective equipment like gowns and masks early on in the pandemic, shipping it from China to hospitals in the United States via chartered airplanes and trucks. As the pandemic was unfolding, demand exploded for software that helps businesses run their operations online, like Salesforce’s customer relationship management tools. Salesforce had already been hiring at a fast clip, and during the pandemic Salesforce onboarded another 20,000 employees in a one-year span—and of course many more through acquisitions like Slack.Late last year, that growth came to a sudden stop amid concerns of a global economic slowdown. Tech companies from Amazon to Zillow started laying off workers. In January, Salesforce jumped on the bandwagon, announcing that it would cut 10% of its workforce.True to his character and communication style, Benioff infused the bad news with hints of ohana, spelled out in a company memo: “The employees being affected aren’t just colleagues. They’re friends. They’re family. Please reach out to them,” Benioff wrote. “Offer the compassion and love they and their families deserve and need now more than ever. And most of all, please lean on your leadership, including me, as we work through this difficult time together.”Other companies, like Amazon, have been decidedly more blunt. To wit, CEO Andy Jassy’s March 20 memo announcing a second round of layoffs: “I’m writing to share that we intend to eliminate about 9,000 more positions in the next few weeks … This was a difficult decision, but one that we think is best for the company long term.”That all-business tone might sound harsh. But it does raise the question of how useful ohana really is to those who just lost their jobs.While Benioff likes to say this is his third recession, many of his younger, newer hires haven’t yet lived through even one downturn during their careers. And even those who were not laid off have had to make uncomfortable changes. Early on in the pandemic, Salesforce embraced remote work, telling employees they could work from anywhere. When the company acquired collaboration tool Slack for $27.7 billion in July 2021, Benioff said integrating the product would help customers “make the digital transformation.” But that transition to remote work wasn’t as smooth as expected.Chart shows Salesforce stock cumulative total returns since 2021Benioff made waves when he took to Slack, not long before announcing layoffs, to ask why employees hired during the pandemic showed “much lower productivity.” To the CEO, this was an effort to solicit feedback. But to some employees, Benioff’s musings felt like a betrayal, a stark contrast to the pandemic-era benefit of getting one Friday off per month, which had just recently ended.The reaction inside Salesforce was harsh, with some employees accusing Benioff of being tone deaf in Slack channels. Other recent cost-saving measures, such as lower annual “gratitude” bonuses and the decision to abandon Slack’s snazzy San Francisco headquarters, have also generated employee blowback. In late March, Salesforce also shuttered Future Forum, Slack’s ambitious think tank that was focused on research around remote work.Asked whether tech employees have gained too much power in recent years, Benioff says no, and points to Slack as an effective—if lively—way to communicate directly with employees on a variety of issues. But even that direct access has its limits. “It’s hard for them [employees] because they don’t understand why you’re taking certain actions or how it’s going to affect them,” says Benioff. “It’s understandable because we’ve had an up market for more than a decade.”In recent months, Salesforce has summoned certain employees back to the office. Some percentage of the company’s workforce will always be remote, as was the case pre-pandemic. But those who don’t have that designation are now being asked to come into the office at least a few times a month depending on their roles and teams, says Benioff, noting that tracking productivity is easier for certain functions, like sales and, to a lesser degree, engineering.“We hired a lot of people, and those folks don’t have the benefit of knowing others and having the office experience,” Benioff says of his evolving views on remote work. “Bringing them back into the office is becoming more important than I think anyone realized.”But again, justifying a return to office, however flexible, however backed by data, is hard to do when you’ve just spent the past three years telling employees they could work from anywhere. Just like announcing layoffs after you’ve hired hordes of new employees and told them they were like friends and family.In recent months, Benioff has gotten caught in the crosshairs of some conservative politicians who have jumped onto the anti-ESG bandwagon. Vivek Ramaswamy, 2024 Republican presidential hopeful and former executive chairman of Strive Asset Management, which owns a small stake in Salesforce, has criticized the CEO for choosing politics over profits. And with some blaming Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse on a supposed “distraction” by diversity efforts, it’s easy to see how some of Salesforce’s speed bumps could be smeared with similar allegations.But Benioff says his devotion to using business as a platform for societal change is intact.“There’s been a politicization of stakeholder capitalism which is in many cases unfair,” says Benioff. “What employees want is to be treated well, and to make sure that their companies are doing the right thing, which is at the heart of stakeholder capitalism.”Benioff has a point: Many of the times he’s taken a stand, like when he threatened to pull business out of Indiana because of an anti-LGBTQ law, came from listening to what his employees were telling him, not the other way around. At least as of now, Salesforce’s biggest activist shareholders—the ones who have actually acquired sizable stakes—are not speaking out about the company’s diversity programs, nor the fact that Benioff has made it his life mission to plant 1 trillion trees by 2030. They’re much more concerned with boosting software sales and profits. And in a succession plan.Bret Taylor wasn’t the first co-CEO to leave Salesforce, but his departure was a surprise. So were the subsequent exits of Stewart Butterfield, the former head of Slack, and of Mark Nelson, the ex-CEO of Tableau, another pricey Salesforce acquisition. “Each person has to make their own decisions,” says Benioff.8,000layoffs implemented by Salesforce since January 2023Asked whether he would pursue the co-CEO model again, Benioff says probably not anytime soon. “Right now, profitability is my only strategy,” he says, adding that he does have a current succession plan in place. (Who is the new heir apparent? Unsurprisingly, Benioff won’t say.)Whatever the plan is, Benioff is clearly under pressure to solidify it. Activist investors clamoring for change have already pushed Salesforce to appoint three new directors to its board. And unlike some other founder-CEOs, Benioff isn’t shareholder-proof. The board, if not satisfied, could vote him out.At least some signs seem to be pointing in the right direction for Benioff: On March 27, Salesforce and one of its loudest activist shareholders, Elliott Investment Management, issued a joint statement, with Elliott saying it was pleased with the company’s newfound commitment to “profitable growth,” and that it wouldn’t move forward with nominating its own slate of director nominations, which it had threatened to do.“I actually think it’s very healthy,” Benioff says of the role activist investors have played in his company’s decisions in recent months. “You’re going to meet people you’ve never met, and they’re going to have perspectives that are completely different. Their primary focus is to make money, and that’s what they’re doing.”For now, Benioff doesn’t see the goal of making money—and getting Salesforce on a more profitable track—as mutually exclusive with planting trees or investing in DEI initiatives or calling his workforce his family. “My performance speaks for itself, and that’s all I can hope for,” he tells me after his plane lands. That’s true. But now comes the hard part: getting his stakeholders—all of them—to agree, even in hard economic times. In other words, to explain the unexplainable.Additional reporting by Kylie RobisonThis article appears in the April/May 2023 issue of Fortune with the headline, ""'Ohana' meets austerity.""This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

(PCG) Stock Options,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/implied-volatility-surging-pg-e-124012376.html,1680180012,STORY,['PCGU'],"[Investors in PG&amp;E Corporation PCG need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 21, 2023 $3.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for PG&amp;E Corp. shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, PG&amp;E Corp. is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Utility - Electric Power industry that ranks in the Bottom 37% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 24 cents per share to 28 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about PG&amp;E Corp. right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

74,d33eddda-c3fe-3105-91f1-e21da6187d01,NWS,2023-03-31,Realtor.com® March Housing Report: Spring Thaw Lures Buyers Back into the Housing Market,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/realtor-com-march-housing-report-100000931.html,1680170400.0,STORY,"['NWS', 'NWSA', 'NWSAL']","[Despite slim pickings and affordability challenges, buyers got a jump on spring shopping in March, but rising rates could cause a late-spring frostSANTA CLARA, Calif., March 30, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Spring is officially here, and like green shoots emerging from the bleak winter, new data suggests that more buyers are back in the market, although more subdued compared to a year ago. According to the Realtor.com® Monthly Housing Trends Report released today, the recent six-month surge in active listings lost momentum, moderating to 59.9% year-over-year, and time on market shrank to 54 days, from January's high of 74 days, as buyers eased back into the market in March, but higher mortgage rates could freeze them back out.""Signs show that buyers are active in the spring housing market, even if they aren't as numerous as they were during the pandemic. Amid fewer new choices on the market and still rising home prices, home shoppers have shown that they are very rate sensitive, only jumping back in the market when rates dip, and so what happens with rates this spring will likely play a strong role in determining whether the housing market bumps along or picks up speed this year,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""With so much built up equity, home sellers are still faring well, but many are sitting on the sidelines. The usual seasonal pick-up in buyer demand appears to be underway, one of several factors that make spring the Best Time to Sell. With an uncertain market ahead, it may be even more important for potential sellers to aim for this year's seasonal sweet spot.""Now may be the best time to sell, and homeowners need to put their best foot forwardIf homeowners are planning to sell in 2023, now is the time to get ready. Realtor.com®'s Best Time to Sell analysis found that nationally, the week of April 16-22, 2023 will bring sellers the best combination of market conditions this year, including higher home prices, fewer other homes for sale, a faster sale, and stronger demand.Story continues""Well-priced, move-in ready homes with curb appeal in desirable areas are still receiving multiple offers and selling for over the asking price in many parts of the country,"" said Realtor.com®'s Executive News Editor Clare Trapasso. ""So this spring, it's especially important for sellers to make their homes as attractive as possible to appeal to as many buyers as possible. They should make any necessary repairs, spruce up the landscaping, and invest in staging and professional photographs. Homes that are priced too high, are in need of major repairs, or aren't presented professionally are often sitting on the market for longer and sometimes selling for under the initial asking price.""March 2023 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over March 2022Change over March 2019Median listing price+6.3% (to $424,000)+38.8 %Active listings+59.9 %-49.5 %New listings-20.1 %-26.9 %Median days on market+18 days (to 54 days)-18 daysShare of active listings with price reductions+6.8 percentage points (to 12.6%)-2.3 percentage points Lack of new homes coming on to the market a drag on home salesThe U.S. inventory of active listings continued to climb in March over last year's lows, but the rate of growth cooled slightly from the brisk pace seen the previous two months. With new listings remaining scarce in March, the rise in the number of homes for sale is a reflection of more time spent on the market compared to last year rather than an influx of new sellers. A lack of new homes to the market continues to be a drag on home sales; attitudes toward housing worsened in February, especially among potential sellers, which likely signals ongoing weakness in the number of new homes for sale this year. Higher interest rates continue to create affordability challenges for buyers, and fewer homes went under contract compared to last year.The U.S. supply of active listings for sale rose 59.9% compared to this time last year, but it is still 49.6% below pre-pandemic 2017 - 2019 levels, on average. There were 211,000 more homes available to buy in March compared to one year ago.Newly-listed homes for sale continued to fall in March (-20.1%) compared to this time last year. This is a higher rate of decline than last month's 15.9% decrease and 29.7% below pre-pandemic 2017 - 2019 levels. Pending listings, or homes under contract with a buyer, declined year-over-year (-24.5%).The number of homes for sale across the 50 largest metros was up 74.4% compared to a year ago. The South saw the highest growth in active listings (+127.4%).Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, 47 markets saw active inventory increase compared to last March, with the most growth in Austin (+312.2%), Raleigh (+273.7%), and Nashville (+253.3%). Only three markets had inventory declines on a year-over-year basis, including Milwaukee (-17.2%), Hartford (-17.0%), and New York (-0.9%).Home prices continue to rise but could decline compared to last year as early as summerIn March, national median list prices continued to rise year-over-year, but the rate at which prices are rising slowed to the lowest level since June 2020, in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. At this rate of slowing, list prices could decline relative to last year as early as this summer, following the recent national median sale price decline, which fell annually for the first time in 10 years last month. The share of homes with price reductions is up significantly from last year, but dipped below 2017–2019 pre-pandemic levels in February and continued to decline in March, indicating that the smaller number of homeowners who are putting their homes up for sale appear to be readjusting their home price expectations to the realities of today's market.The national median listing price was $424,000 in March, up from $415,000 in February. Annual list price growth continued to slow to 6.3% over last year, the lowest rate of growth since June 2020, in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, the biggest annual listing price gains continue to be in the Midwest, up 14.1%, on average from last year. The metros with the biggest asking price increases were Memphis, Tenn. (+40.3%), Milwaukee (+26.3%), and Kansas City, Mo. (+17.7%); however, in these metros the mix of inventory also changed and more larger, expensive homes are for sale today.In March, 12.6% of active listings had their price reduced, up from 5.8% a year ago.Nine out of the largest 50 markets saw their median list price decline in March. Large southern metros (+9.1 percentage points) continued to see the largest increase in the share of listings with price reductions, and the greatest year-over-year declines in the median list price were seen in Austin, Texas (-8.4% year-over-year), Las Vegas (-6.7%), and New Orleans (-5.1%).Homes are taking longer to sell, but not as long as pre-pandemic levelsA typical home spent more time on market compared to last year, although after rising steadily from summer 2022, the usual seasonal pickup in the sales pace shrank the gap and homes sold faster in March than in January and February, suggesting that buyers are active in the market, even if they are not as numerous as this time last year. Even though the typical home listing was on the market for more than two weeks longer than this time last year, homes are still selling just over two weeks faster on average than before the pandemic boom.In March, the typical home spent 54 days on market, 18 days longer than this time last year, but still 15 days faster than the pre-pandemic March 2017-2019 average.Across the 50 largest U.S. metros, time on market was lower in March relative to the national pace, 46 days on average, and was 16 days slower than March 2022.Time on market increased compared to last year in all 50 metros with the greatest increases in Raleigh, N.C. (+42 days), Kansas City, Mo. (+37 days), and Austin, Texas (+37 days).March 2023 Housing Metrics – 50 Largest U.S. Metro AreasMetro AreaMedianListing PriceMedianListing Price YoYMedianListingPrice per Sq. Ft.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Medical Stocks To Invest In. The global healthcare sector has been permanently transformed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in a faster adoption of novel technologies and care delivery methods, as well as a heightened emphasis on sustainability and resilience. The COVID-19 outbreak brought about a rapid increase in patients, rising healthcare requirements, workforce scarcities, and difficulties in supply chain management. In response, healthcare providers turned to innovative solutions like telemedicine and electronic health records (EHRs) to tackle these problems effectively. These digital technologies were aimed at reducing costs, managing fluctuating demand patterns, addressing the shortage of medical personnel, and improving readiness for potential future global health crises.There is a growing need for healthcare services from small businesses, including clinics, labs, and other providers that cater to local communities. Despite the ongoing trend of consolidation into larger healthcare groups and hospitals, it is predicted that the number of small healthcare practices will increase in 2023. According to IBISWorld, the number of companies that specialize in primary care is expected to rise steadily at a yearly rate of 1.6%, reaching 152,496 businesses by 2027. The outlook for the healthcare sector is predicted to be neutral in 2023 due to various factors, such as a rise in demand for services, the use of a more affordable and personalized delivery approach, progress in business technology, and the capacity to adjust to the evolving healthcare environment.In 2023, healthcare expenses are expected to decrease in real terms due to high inflation rates and sluggish economic growth, as per a report by Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). This scenario will prompt the need for difficult decisions on how to provide care. The healthcare system will continue to digitize, but there will be stricter regulations on the use of health data in the US, Europe, and China. Patent cliffs for vital drugs and attempts to regulate pharmaceutical pricing in countries such as the US and India will lead major pharma companies to pursue growth via mergers and acquisitions. Despite investing in more localized pharmaceutical production, drugmakers' expenses will still increase due to ongoing supply chain disruptions. Story continuesAmid this market outlook, some of the best medical stocks to invest in include Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), and DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM).

Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) designs, manufactures, and promotes Invisalign transparent braces, as well as iTero dental scanners and related services. These products are aimed at orthodontists and general dental practitioners, and are sold both in the United States and internationally, including in Switzerland and China. On February 6, Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) announced a new accelerated share buyback agreement with Citibank to repurchase $250 million of the company’s common stock.On February 2, Elizabeth Anderson, an analyst at Evercore ISI, increased the target price for Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) from $230 to $375 and maintained an Outperform rating on the company's shares. According to the firm, Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN)’s Q4 financial results were better than expected, and the outlook for Q1 suggests a positive trend for 2023 and beyond. Although 2023 may still have some fluctuations, the company's operational performance is improving, and there may be approximately $1 billion worth of share repurchases during the year. Evercore ISI believes that there are both fundamental and technical reasons to continue investing in Align Technology. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 34 hedge funds were bullish on Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN), compared to 38 funds in the prior quarter. Brian Bares’ Bares Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 935,246 shares worth $197.2 million. In addition to Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), and DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) is one of the best medical stocks to invest in. Meridian Contrarian Fund made the following comment about Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN), is a leader in the orthodontic industry that pioneered the clear aligner segment with its well-known Invisalign ™ product. Pandemic-related disruptions to earnings and the impact of tough foreign exchange rates on Align’s significant international business pushed the stock’s valuation to what we believed was an attractive level. We believe the company remains an industry leader and that clear aligners, which hold an industry penetration rate of roughly 15%, have a long runway for growth, so we initiated a position during the quarter.”12. DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) offers kidney dialysis services to patients in the United States who have chronic kidney failure. The company runs centers where patients can receive dialysis treatment and also provides laboratory services at outpatient dialysis centers. Additionally, DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) provides hemodialysis services that can be done on an outpatient basis, in a hospital setting, or even at the patient's own home. It is one of the best medical stocks to invest in. On February 23, Gary Taylor, an analyst at Cowen, increased the target price on DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) shares from $76 to $90 and maintained an Outperform rating. According to the analyst, the labor costs in Q4 did not experience a significant decline compared to the previous quarter, despite the company's guidance in October. However, it is worth noting that DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) has raised the lower end of its guidance, which suggests a positive outlook for the company's future performance, the analyst wrote in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 34 hedge funds were bullish on DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), compared to 30 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 36 million shares worth $2.7 billion. Moon Capital made the following comment about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider.

During these efforts, valuations for the company have been under pressure due to liability issues stemming from opioid litigation as well as concerns about increased scrutiny of drug prices by politicians.Our team has been following these developments and believes the strides management has made on the business side are not being fully recognized by the market. As more clarity has emerged related to opioid litigation, we’ve increased the portfolio’s stake in AmerisourceBergen and believe the investment provides the portfolio with additional exposure to a high-quality business that is well positioned to grow despite operating in a mature industry.”8.

Holding Limited, announced it has signed a Heads of Agreement (HOA) with the Republic of Equatorial Guinea (E.G.) and Noble Energy E.G. Ltd, a Chevron company, to progress the next phases (Phases II and III) in the development of the Equatorial Guinea Regional Gas Mega Hub (GMH).(PRNewsfoto/Marathon Oil Corporation)""We are excited about this critical milestone in the ongoing development of Punta Europa as a world-class hub for the monetization of local and regional natural gas,"" said Lee Tillman, Marathon Oil Chairman, President, and CEO. ""This announcement builds on our successful partnership of more than 20 years with the E.G. Government, further leveraging and extending the life of E.G.'s world-class gas monetization infrastructure, including the critical E.G. LNG facility, into the next decade.""Phase I of the GMH was successfully achieved with the tieback of the Alen Field to Punta Europa, which delivered first gas in February 2021. Alen gas is processed under the combination of a tolling and profit-sharing arrangement through Alba Plant LLC's onshore Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) plant (MRO 52% interest) and Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Ltd's LNG facility (E.G. LNG, MRO 56% interest).The announced HOA builds on the success of Phase I, aligning all parties on necessary commercial principles to advance Phases II and III of the GMH.More specifically, Phase II involves processing Alba Unit (MRO 64% interest) gas, from Jan. 1, 2024, under new contractual terms following the legacy Henry Hub-linked Alba sales and purchase agreement expiration at the end of this year. Phase II will materially increase MRO's exposure to global LNG pricing and is expected to improve the Company's E.G. earnings and cash flow significantly. Phase III of the GMH is expected to facilitate gas processing from the Aseng Field at Punta Europa facilities.Story continuesAdditionally, a recently established bilateral treaty on cross-border oil and gas development between E.G. and Cameroon provides other opportunities to further expand the GMH through fast-track monetization of cross-border wet gas fields.The E.G. Government, represented by the Ministry of Mines &amp; Hydrocarbons, has taken an active role in leading the successful implementation of this GMH expansion and is committed to ensuring subsequent activities and negotiations progress in a timely manner.Beyond the commercial benefits, the expanded development also secures future fuel gas volumes for E.G.'s power generation needs, provides longer-term employment opportunities for Equatoguineans, and will positively impact the local communities' economy.

The startups selling it want you to be,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-afraid-ai-startups-selling-120024471.html,1680264024,STORY,['MSFT'],"[OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman speaks to the media Feb. 7 about the integration of the Microsoft Bing search engine and Edge browser with OpenAI. (Bloomberg via Getty Images)You’ve probably heard by now: AI is coming, it’s about to change everything, and humanity is not ready.Artificial intelligence is passing bar exams, plagiarizing term papers, creating deepfakes that are real enough to fool the masses, and the robot apocalypse is nigh. The government isn’t prepared. Neither are you.Tesla founder Elon Musk, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and hundreds of AI researchers signed an open letter this week urging a pause on AI development before it gets too powerful. “A.I. could rapidly eat the whole of human culture,” three tech ethicists wrote in a New York Times op-ed. A cottage industry of AI hustlers have taken to Twitter, Substack and YouTube to demonstrate the formidable potential and power of AI, racking up millions of views and shares.The doomscroll goes on. A Times columnist had a series of conversations with Bing and wound up afraid for humanity. A Goldman Sachs report says AI could replace 300 million jobs.The concern has made its way into the halls of power too. On Monday, Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.) tweeted, “ChatGPT taught itself to do advanced chemistry. It wasn't built into the model. Nobody programmed it to learn complicated chemistry. It decided to teach itself, then made its knowledge available to anyone who asked.”“Something is coming. We aren't ready.”Nothing of the sort has happened, of course, but it’s hard to blame the senator. AI doomsaying is absolutely everywhere right now. Which is exactly the way that OpenAI, the company that stands to benefit the most from everyone believing its product has the power to remake — or unmake — the world, wants it.OpenAI is behind the buzziest and most popular AI service, the text generator ChatGPT, and its technology currently powers Microsoft’s new AI-infused Bing search engine, the product of a deal worth $10 billion. ChatGPT-3 is free to use, a premium tier that guarantees more stable access is $20 a month, and there’s a whole portfolio of services available for purchase to meet any enterprise’s text or image-generation needs.Story continuesSam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, declared that he was “a little bit scared” of the technology that he is helping to build and aiming to disseminate, for profit, as widely as possible. OpenAI’s chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, said last week, “At some point it will be quite easy, if one wanted, to cause a great deal of harm” with the models they are making available to anyone willing to pay. And a new report produced and released by the company proclaims that its technology will put “most” jobs at some degree of risk of elimination.Let’s consider the logic behind these statements for a second: Why would you, a CEO or executive at a high-profile technology company, repeatedly return to the public stage to proclaim how worried you are about the product you are building and selling?Answer: If apocalyptic doomsaying about the terrifying power of AI serves your marketing strategy.AI, like other, more basic forms of automation, isn’t a traditional business. Scaring off customers isn't a concern when what you’re selling is the fearsome power that your service promises.OpenAI has worked for years to carefully cultivate an image of itself as a team of hype-proof humanitarian scientists, pursuing AI for the good of all — which meant that when its moment arrived, the public would be well-primed to receive its apocalyptic AI proclamations credulously, as scary but impossible-to-ignore truths about the state of technology.OpenAI was founded as a research nonprofit in 2015, with a large grant from Musk, a noted AI doomer, with the aim of “democratizing” AI. The company has long cultivated an air of dignified restraint in its AI endeavors; its stated aim was to research and develop the technology in a way that was responsible and transparent. The blog post announcing OpenAI declared, “Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.”For years, this led the media and AI scientists to treat the organization as if it was a research institution, which in turn allowed it to command greater levels of respect in the media and the academic community — and bear less scrutiny. It garnered good graces by sharing examples of how powerful its tools were becoming — OpenAI’s bots winning an esports championship, early examples of entire articles written by its GPT-2 AI — while exhorting the need to be cautious, and keeping its models secret and out of the hands of bad actors.In 2019, the company transitioned to a “capped” for-profit company, while continuing to insist its “primary fiduciary duty is to humanity.” This month, however, OpenAI announced that it was taking the formerly open source code that made its bots possible private. The rationale: Its product (which is available for purchase) was simply too powerful to risk falling into the wrong hands.OpenAI’s nonprofit background nonetheless imbued it with a halo of respectability when the company released a working paper with researchers from the University of Pennsylvania last week. The research, which, again, was carried out by OpenAI itself, concluded that “most occupations” now “exhibit some degree of exposure” to large language models, or LLMs, such as the one underlying ChatGPT. Higher-wage occupations have more tasks with high exposure. And “approximately 19% of jobs” will see at least half of all the tasks they involve exposed to LLMs.These findings were covered dutifully in the media, while critics, including Dan Greene, an assistant professor at University of Maryland’s Information Studies College, pointed out that this was less a scientific assessment than a self-fulfilling prophecy. “You use the new tool to tell its own fortune,” he said. “The point is not to be ‘correct’ but to mark down a boundary for public debate.”Whether OpenAI set out to become a for-profit company in the first place, the end result is the same: the unleashing of a science fiction-infused marketing frenzy unlike anything in recent memory.Now, the benefits of this apocalyptic AI marketing are twofold. First, it encourages users to try the “scary” service in question — what better way to generate a buzz than to insist, with a certain presumed credibility, that your new technology is so potent it might unravel the world as we know it?The second is more mundane: The bulk of OpenAI’s income is unlikely to come from average users paying for premium-tier access. The business case for a rando paying monthly fees to access a chatbot that is marginally more interesting and useful than, say, Google Search, is highly unproven.OpenAI knows this. It’s almost certainly betting its longer-term future on more partnerships like the one with Microsoft and enterprise deals serving large companies. That means convincing more corporations that if they want to survive the coming AI-led mass upheaval, they’d better climb aboard.Enterprise deals have always been where automation technology has thrived — sure, a handful of consumers might be interested in streamlining their daily routine or automating tasks here and there, but the core sales target for productivity software or automated kiosks or robotics is management.And a big driver in motivating companies to buy into automation technology is and always has been fear. The historian of technology David Noble demonstrated in his studies of industrial automation that the wave of workplace and factory floor automation that swept the 1970s and '80s was largely spurred by managers submitting to a highly pervasive phenomenon that today we recognize as FOMO. If companies believe a labor-saving technology is so powerful or efficient that their competitors are sure to adopt it, they don’t want to miss out — regardless of the ultimate utility.The great promise of OpenAI’s suite of AI services is, at root, that companies and individuals will save on labor costs — they can generate the ad copy, art, slide deck presentations, email marketing and data entry processes fast and cheap.This is not to suggest that OpenAI’s image and text generators are not capable of interesting, amazing or even unsettling things. But the conflicted genius schtick that Altman and his OpenAI coterie are putting on is wearing thin. If you are genuinely concerned about the safety of your product, if you seriously want to be a responsible steward in the development of an artificially intelligent tool you believe to be ultra-powerful, you don’t slap it onto a search engine where it can be accessed by billions of people; you don’t open the floodgates.Altman argues that the technology needs to be released, at this relatively early stage, so that his team can make mistakes and address potential abuses “while the stakes are fairly low."" Implicit in this argument, however, is the notion that we should simply trust him and his newly cloistered company with how best to do so, even as they work to meet revenue projections of $1 billion next year.I’m not saying don’t be nervous about the onslaught of AI services — but I am saying be nervous for the right reasons. There’s plenty to be wary about, especially given the prospect that companies most certainly will find the sales pitch alluring and whether it works, a lot of copywriters, coders and artists are suddenly going to find their work not necessarily replaced but devalued by the ubiquitous and much cheaper AI services on offer. (There’s a reason artists have already launched a class-action lawsuit alleging AI systems were trained on their work.)But the hand-wringing over an all-powerful “artificial general intelligence” and the incendiary hype tend to obscure those nearer-term types of concerns. AI ethicists and researchers such as Timnit Gebru and Meredith Whittaker have been shouting into the void that an abstract fear of an imminent SkyNet misses the forest for the trees.“One of the biggest harms of large language models is caused by claiming that LLMs have ‘human-competitive intelligence,’” Gebru said.There’s a real and legitimate danger that this stuff will produce biased or even discriminatory results, help misinformation proliferate, steamroll over artists’ intellectual property and more — especially because a lot of Big Tech companies just happen to have fired their AI ethics teams.It’s perfectly legitimate to be afraid of the power of a new technology. Just know that OpenAI — and all of the other AI companies that stand to cash in on the hype — very much want you to be.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Additionally, it also includes earnings from businesses that offer design, support services, documentation, and installation.An industry analysis report by Research and Markets estimates that the global digital PC games market was valued at $10.86 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach a value of $12.67 billion by the end of 2023, registering a compound annual growth rate of 16.7%. The global PC games market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15.0% from 2022 through 2027, and reach a valuation of $22.17 billion by the end of the forecasted period.The rapid growth can be attributed to the rising demand for PC games available digitally. Players are driven to access PC games digitally due to the convenience, cross-buying, and ease of storage that digital distribution offers. Also, pre-ordering allows players to receive games already loaded onto their devices, giving them rapid access to the titles as soon as they are released. Moreover, a significant development in the market for digital PC games is the rise of cloud gaming. With this ground-breaking technology, the supplier operates the game on its servers, streams back the visuals to the player, and boosts user numbers for pricey games. Additionally, cloud-based game streaming minimizes the requirement for hardware upgrades. As a result, more people are playing digital PC games, which is driving the expansion of the sector.According to Research and Markets, in 2022, the digital PC games market was dominated by the Asia-Pacific region, and this trajectory is expected to continue over the forecasted period. Rising disposable income and the growing popularity of online gaming will fuel the Asia-Pacific PC gaming industry.Story continuesMarket Leaders in the Digital PC Games MarketAmong the leading companies operating in the digital PC games market are Activision Blizzard, Inc.

Apple continues to pump out innovative products, with its flagship iPhone and Mac computers leading the way, helping them retain their top spot.In 2022, Apple stock prices dropped about 25%, as rising interest rates slowed growth, and investors rotated into more stable investments. But it has recovered a bit in 2023, and is only down about 14% from the previous all-time-high stock price in January of 2022.Apple is one of the only tech companies to avoid mass layoffs, and has implemented several cost-cutting measures to keep it that way.Apple’s Price-to-Earnings ratio of 26.4 seems more in line with industry standards than some of its tech peers that saw very inflated valuations just a few years ago. And while this is still historically high for the tech sector, it means Apple is more fairly valued than some other tech companies.Overall, Apple continues to be the model tech company for investors, showing stability in the face of economic turmoil. And with a large cash reserve and an innovative product team, they seem poised to continue growth for years to come.Story continuesTake Our Poll: Are You Concerned About the Safety of Your Money in Your Bank Accounts?Microsoft (MSFT)Market Cap: $2 trillionPrice-to-Earning Ratio (P/E Ratio): 30.2Layoffs (2022-2023): 10,000Stock Price Drop (from all-time-high): 21%Microsoft is the second most valuable company in the world, with a $2 trillion market cap and $200 billion in revenue per year. Microsoft offers a wide range of products, including personal and business software, as well as computers, tablets, and the Xbox gaming system.In 2022, Microsoft stock prices dropped about 35% as most of the tech sector was crushed by rising rates. In 2023, the stock rebounded a bit, and is now only down about 21% from its previous all-time-high price in 2021.In light of lower valuations and increasing cost of debt, Microsoft has laid off 10,000 employees as a cost-cutting measure, with layoffs scheduled to be completed by the third quarter of 2023.Microsoft’s P/E ratio of 30.2 is a bit elevated compared to the industry, but it is far lower than the 50+ P.E. ratio it saw in 2017, and 35 ratio back in December of 2021. This might mean that Microsoft is slightly overvalued compared to the earnings it produces.Overall, Microsoft has seen more downside than Apple, but is still one of the top companies in the world for a reason. As they place bets on Artificial Intelligence and the Metaverse, Microsoft is well-poised for the future of tech.Alphabet (GOOG)Market Cap: $1.3 trillionPrice-to-Earning Ratio (P/E Ratio): 21.9Layoffs (2022-2023): 12,000Stock Price Drop (from all-time-high): 33%Google is one of the only trillion-dollar companies in the world, and is the fourth most valuable company in the world by market cap. Google is the search engine king, garnering over 90% of the worldwide market share for search queries.Google stock prices dropped significantly, dropping 40% between January and December of 2022. And Google stock is still down, priced 33% lower than its previous all-time-high price in  February of 2022.In response to rising rates, Google announced laying off 12,000 workers in 2023, which is the most of any tech company so far.Google’s Price-to-Earnings ratio of 21.9 is reasonable compared to the inflated ratios of near 30 it saw in 2020 and 2021. This means that Google may be fairly valued based on their earnings and sector.Overall, Google has no challengers in the search engine space, and is branching out into other products, including cloud services, internet services, and hardware products. But with competition heating up in the A.I., video (TikTok) and hardware space, Google has some challenges to overcome to continue growing.Amazon (AMZN)Market Cap: $996 billionPrice-to-Earning Ratio (P/E Ratio): 77Layoffs (2022-2023): 27,000Stock Price Drop (from all-time-high): 48%Amazon is the fifth most valuable company in the world (by market cap), with over $990 billion in value. Amazon is the ultimate online shopping company, offering most every product under the sun, delivered to your doorstep. It also has a media arm and grocery store (Whole Foods), making it a powerhouse company.In 2022, due to economic headwinds, Amazon saw its first annual loss since 2014, and stock prices dropped about 50%. Part of this loss was due to unrealized losses for its investment in electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian.But Amazon stock prices have only slightly recovered, and are still down 48% from all-time-high prices in November of 2021. Amazon also announced laying off 10,000 workers in 2023.Amazon’s Price-to-Earnings ratio of 77 is astronomically high for the overall sector, about 3x its nearest competitors. But this is partially due to their continued investment in the company, causing earnings to slow, but investors see these investments paying off in the future.Overall, Amazon may be overvalued to some, but others see the future as a huge growth opportunity for the tech giant.Meta Platforms (META)Market Cap: $520 billionPrice-to-Earning Ratio (P/E Ratio): 23.3Layoffs (2022-2023): 21,000Stock Price Drop (from all-time-high): 48%Meta Platforms (Facebook) is the largest social media company in the world, and has over 3 billion users across its platforms. Facebook was the original company, but it has evolved and grown to include Instagram, WhatsApp, and other products and services.In 2022, Meta Platforms stock prices dropped about 63% due to missed earnings reports, massive losses on its Reality Labs investments, and overall economic conditions. Stock prices have climbed a bit, but are still down 48% from the all-time-high prices in August of 2021.Due to these massive losses, Meta has shed over 20,000 jobs since 2022.With the massive price drop, Meta’s Price-to-Earnings ratio has come back to earth, settling at about 23. Some might see this as too high, but investing in Meta is betting on the future of the metaverse at this point, so there’s a potential massive upside. Overall, Meta Platforms continues to be a social media powerhouse, but competition is heating up.Bottom LineTech companies have taken a lot of heat in the past two years, but some of the biggest companies are doubling down on innovation and investing in the future. With Microsoft and Google focusing on artificial intelligence, and Apple and Meta focusing on virtual reality and the metaverse, there are exciting things coming.However, investing in these companies requires understanding their valuations, future growth potential and marketplace competition. While stock price drops make it tempting to want to jump in and invest, things could still go down further. As always, education and understanding the risk of individual stock investing can help you make smarter money decisions.More From GOBankingRatesKeep an Eye Out for Rare Dime Worth as Much as $2,000 -- How To Spot ItWhat Is the State of Women &amp; Money in 2023?Build Your Credit Score with These Simple StrategiesExperts: 4 Safest Places To Keep Your SavingsThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Much Amazon, Apple, Meta and the Biggest Tech Companies Are Worth]"

As always, during the conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations.Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 2 and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement after this presentation, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. You can find our press release and the slides referenced on this call in the Investors section of the Walgreens Boots Alliance website. The slides in the press release also contain further information about the non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this call. I'll now turn the call over to Roz.Rosalind Brewer: Thanks, Tiffany, and good morning, everyone. WBA has delivered a solid second quarter. Overall, results were in line with our expectations as the slow start earlier in the quarter was offset by strong acceleration in February. The overall decline in adjusted EPS was against growth of 26.5% last year and again reflects the anticipated headwind from lower COVID demand and our investments in labor and the U.S. Healthcare segment. This is our final quarter of lapping last year's peak COVID contributions, and we are looking forward to accelerated growth ahead. Second quarter sales grew 4.5% in constant currency. U.S. script volume growth exceeded guidance and our resilient retail business is successfully lapping record prior year performances.Story continuesThis was also a landmark quarter for our transformation to healthcare. We invested $3.5 billion to support VillageMD's acquisition of Summit Health, creating one of the leading independent provider groups in the country. At the same time, we are taking decisive action to unlock value and strengthen the company by simplifying the portfolio. Our strategy is working. We are performing against our plans, and we will be relentless in driving continued progress ahead. We are maintaining our full year guidance for adjusted EPS of $4.45 to $4.65 with good visibility into the key drivers of robust and accelerated growth in the second half. Importantly, the inflection is here. We are clearly pivoting to strong projected EPS growth in the mid-20s in the second half.I am very confident in our future, enabled by our execution and the bold investments we are making today. We are making progress against each of our four strategic priorities. Let's start with the core business. U.S. Pharmacy comp scripts grew 3.5%, excluding immunization, exceeding our guidance of 3% growth and improving from 2.1% last quarter. Through our focused investments, we have returned an incremental 500 stores to normal pharmacy operating hours. Our market share trends are improving, and we saw 6% growth in stores with normal hours. While we have more work ahead of us to achieve our full year script recapture goals, I'm very encouraged by our momentum with strong acceleration into January and February. Our pharmacist team is supported by our nine micro-fulfillment centers, which allow our pharmacists more time to focus on patient care and clinical services, expanding on the critical role they already provide in communities.In Retail, U.S. comp sales, excluding tobacco, declined slightly. A very solid performance against the 15.7% growth we delivered last year. We achieved mid-single-digit growth after backing out the COVID OTC test headwind from last year's Omicron surge. The convenience and real value that Walgreens offers is resonating with consumers in a challenging environment. In fact, our comp accelerated to high single digits in February, while we also drove another quarter of margin expansion. In our International segment, Boots had a stellar quarter with retail comp growth of 16% on top of 22% last year. The business achieved its eighth consecutive quarter of retail market share gains. Now turning to our second strategic priority. We are accelerating the build-out of our healthcare growth engine.The addition of Summit Health is transformational. It creates one of the largest integrated provider platforms in the U.S., delivering quality affordable care for all patient populations regardless of insurance or payer type. This highly strategic transaction expands VillageMD's addressable market with primary care, multi-specialty and urgent care and reinforces our approach across the entire care continuum. Summit will accelerate the U.S. Healthcare segment to scale and profit. We see meaningful synergy potential over time with integration activities already begun. We have also added our fourth payer partner for the organic business, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey and now have signed 5 clinical trials contracts. Shields Health Solutions and CareCentrix both continue to perform well, which led to the accelerated acquisition of both entities.Shields closed on December 28, and CareCentrix is scheduled to close this quarter. On a combined basis, our best-in-class assets drove pro forma sales growth of 30% in the quarter. Investments in this growth are funded through actions we continue to take to better align our portfolio and streamline the business. We've unlocked meaningful value fiscal year-to-date with over $3.6 billion in after-tax proceeds. Our Retail Pharmacy business provides a solid foundation for our leading healthcare assets to deliver value across the full care continuum driving our long-term growth strategy. We are able to reach across both digital and physical channels to guide consumers through the complexities in healthcare. We are building the scale and resources to help health plans and patients improve outcomes and lower costs and only Walgreens can do.There are significant opportunities for synergies, allowing us to pursue value-based care and risk arrangements, which will demonstrate the importance of an integrated approach. We are focused on expanding our risk business, supporting integrated care models, broadening our pharmacy value proposition and driving operational efficiencies. The combination of our best-in-class healthcare assets, a physical presence through our pharmacy footprint, our trusted brand and a scale digital offering creates a platform that is unmatched in the industry. Walgreens will increasingly be viewed as a partner of choice. We are uniquely positioned to engage consumers to manage their individual health and wellness whenever and wherever they need. With that, I'll hand it over to James to provide more color on our results and our outlook.James Kehoe: Thank you, Roz, and good morning. In summary, we delivered a strong performance in the quarter. While we saw some favorable phasing, core operating performance was mostly in line with our internal expectations. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.16 declined by 25.8% on a constant currency basis, and this was entirely due to a 26% headwind from COVID-19 vaccinations and testing. Strong retail performance in both the U.S. and International and sequential improvement in U.S. comp scripts more than offset 10 percentage points of headwinds from payroll investments in the U.S. and expansion of our healthcare business. Gains from a planned cash mobilization in Germany and sale and leaseback net gains in the U.S. contributed approximately $0.12 to adjusted EPS growth.However, this was entirely offset by reduced ownership of our AmerisourceBergen of $0.05, prior year COVID-related onetime benefits in the UK of $0.03 and currency impacts and investment write-offs of $0.04. Despite a slow start to the quarter, we delivered 4.5% sales growth on a constant currency basis with strong momentum exiting the quarter. February saw core sales growth up high single digits, more than offsetting weather-related challenges in December and a noticeable slowdown in respiratory virus cases in January. Comparable sales in U.S. Retail Pharmacy were up 3.1%, despite lapping a very strong prior year comp of 9.5%. Comp script growth of 3.5% exceeded our guidance of 3%. The International sales advanced 9% led by the UK Retail business, which delivered a 16% comp.And our U.S. Healthcare business continues to rapidly scale with sales exceeding $1.6 billion in the quarter and growing 30% on a pro forma basis. So in summary, we had a solid quarter. And based on the in-line performance, we are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.45 to $4.65. Let's now look at the results in more detail. Adjusted operating income declined 25% on a constant currency basis and this was entirely due to a much lower contribution from COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, which led to a headwind of 28%. Labor investments in pharmacy and minimum wage were a 9 percentage point headwind, whereas the expansion of the U.S. Healthcare segment was an impact of 5 percentage points. The labor and healthcare headwinds were offset by strong performance across U.S. Retail and International.Surgery, Medicine, HealthPhoto by Julia Zyablova on UnsplashExcluding COVID-19 OTC test kits, U.S. Retail contributed 12 percentage points of growth and continued strength in International contributed 9 percentage points. Adjusted EPS was $1.16, a constant currency decline of 25.8%, entirely due to a much lower contribution from COVID-19. GAAP net earnings were $703 million, a decline of 20% versus prior year. The current quarter included a $454 million after-tax gain from the sale of ABC shares and a $266 million after-tax charge for opioid-related claims and lawsuits. Now let's move to the year-to-date highlights. Year-to-date sales increased 2.8% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EPS was down 28% on a constant currency basis, mostly due to a much lower contribution from COVID-19 with an adverse impact of approximately 22%.GAAP earnings were a loss of $3 billion compared to net earnings of $4.5 billion in 2022. The year-to-date period included a $5.4 billion after-tax charge for opioid-related claims and lawsuits partly offset by a $1.4 billion after-tax gain on the sale of ABC shares. Additionally, we are comparing to a prior year period that included a $2.5 billion after-tax gain on the company's investments in VillageMD and Shields. Now let's move to the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment. Sales declined slightly in the quarter, reflecting a 3% drag from lower COVID-19 contributions and a 2.5% headwind from AllianceRx. The good news is that AllianceRx has now cycled through its contract losses and the COVID-19 headwind will lessen in subsequent quarters. Comp sales increased 3.1% and this comes on top of a very strong prior year comp of 9.5%.Adjusted operating income declined 32.8% year-on-year, broadly in line with our expectations. This was entirely due to a 29% decline from lower COVID-19 contribution and 10% from planned labor investments. Ongoing reimbursement pressure was offset by retail gross profit growth and SG&amp;A savings. We continue to expect AOI growth to accelerate in the second half, due to a lower COVID-19 headwind, less reimbursement pressure, favorable cost of goods sold timing and script recapture initiatives gaining traction. Let me now turn to U.S. Pharmacy. Pharmacy sales increased 0.3% despite a 3 percentage point headwind from AllianceRx and 2 percentage points from lower COVID-19 contributions. Comp pharmacy sales were up 4.9%, lapping a 7.3% comp last year.Comp scripts were up 0.2%. We administered 2.4 million COVID-19 vaccinations in the second quarter, down a significant 80% versus prior year and about 600,000 COVID-19 PCR tests, down over 90%. Excluding immunizations, comp scripts grew 3.5%, exceeding our forecast of 3%. We are encouraged by the 140 basis point sequential improvement, driven in part by ongoing script recapture initiatives, including the return of an incremental 500 stores to normal operating hours. As expected, adjusted gross profit and margin declined due to the lower contribution from COVID-19 vaccinations and testing and ongoing reimbursement pressure net of procurement savings. Pharmacy reimbursement was broadly in line with our expectations and represented a lower level of pressure compared to the prior year.Looking forward, we expect year-over-year growth in the second half as the COVID headwind lessens, script comps continue to build and second half reimbursement is less of a year-on-year headwind compared to the first half of the year. Turning next to the U.S. Retail business. Overall, we were happy with the retail performance in the quarter, with good underlying sales trends and continued margin improvement. While Retail comp sales decreased 1% in the quarter, we were up against a record 14.7% comp in the prior year, which, as you will recall, included strong OTC testing volume related to the Omicron surge. Excluding tobacco, comp sales were down 0.5%. But on a two-year stack basis, comp sales advanced by more than 15%. Looking at the quarter, lower sales of at-home COVID-19 tests led to a 500 basis point headwind, and this massed strong underlying trends, led by a 13% increase in cough, cold, flu, 9% growth in beauty and a 6% increase in consumables and general merchandise.We had a slower start than expected with December weather impacts leading to weak seasonal sales and some seasonal write-downs, and we sold lessening respiratory various cases in January. However, February was very strong with high single-digit comp growth. Retail gross margin performance remained strong in the quarter, reflecting effective margin management including strategic pricing and promotional optimization and improved shrink. Looking ahead, we expect a return to positive comp trends in the second half as we will be facing a smaller headwind from COVID-19 test kits, and we have meaningful opportunities to drive AOI growth from own brands to myWalgreens loyalty program and strategic margin management. Turning next to the International segment.And as always, I'll talk to constant currency numbers. The International segment continues to perform well. Sales increased 9% with growth across all International markets. Boots UK was up 11% and Germany wholesale grew 7.5%. Adjusted operating income was $352 million, up 66% versus prior year. Adjusted operating income benefited from $110 million in real estate gains from the planned cash mobilization program in Germany. These gains were included in our guidance at the beginning of the year, but were initially assumed to be more evenly split between the first and second quarters. Offsetting this, we are lapping COVID-19-related temporary benefits in the year ago quarter of approximately $40 million. Excluding these two items, we estimate that core AOI grew by around 40%.This excellent performance was led by UK retail sales with a successful holiday trading season and strong operational execution in the Germany wholesale business. We are encouraged by our continued positive trends and looking ahead, we expect the International segment to deliver year-on-year AOI growth in the second half of 2023. Let's now look in more detail at Boots UK. Boots UK sales advanced 11%, led by continued strength in retail. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 2%, held back by lower demand for COVID-19 services. Comparable retail sales advanced 16%, which follows on from a 22% comp in the year ago quarter and benefiting from strong execution over the holiday season. Boots grew market share for the eighth consecutive quarter with gains across all categories, led by beauty up 1.8 percentage points, and consumables and general merchandise up 1.7 percentage points.Boots.com sales were up nearly 80% versus the equivalent pre-COVID period. Over 15% of our UK retail sales now come from Boots.com, up from approximately 9% in the pre-COVID quarter. Turning next to U.S. Healthcare. The U.S. Healthcare business is rapidly scaling with VillageMD's acquisition of Summit Health and strong pro forma sales growth at VillageMD, Shields and CareCentrix. U.S. Healthcare sales exceeded $1.6 billion compared to $527 million in the year ago quarter. Pro forma sales growth was 30%. VillageMD delivered sales of over $1.1 billion, advancing 30% on a pro forma basis, driven by growth at existing clinics, expansion of the clinic footprint and Summit Health growth. Excluding Summit, VillageMD grew 48% year-on-year. Shields continues to deliver with sales of $125 million and increasing 41% on a pro forma basis, driven by recent contract wins, including the addition of three new health system partners and further expansion of existing partnerships.CareCentrix sales were nearly $400 million with pro forma sales growth of 25%, driven primarily by new service offerings with existing partners. Adjusted SG&amp;A in the quarter increased by $177 million to $269 million, primarily due to the acquisitions of CareCentrix and Summit which were not included in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $109 million compared to a loss of $62 million in the prior year. This largely reflects the increased VillageMD clinic count and higher Walgreens Health organic investments, partly offset by positive contributions from Shields and CareCentrix. Let's now look at some of the key metrics for the U.S. Healthcare business. At quarter end, the Walgreens Health organic business had 2.9 million contracted lives, up over 50% year-on-year as existing payer partners added new lines of business.As Roz mentioned, we've also added Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey as our fourth payer partner. Under this agreement, we will provide preventative health and wellness services to a select group of Horizon's Medicare and commercial members. These services will be available at Walgreens Health Corners and pharmacies across New Jersey, starting this summer. VillageMD managed 806,000 value-based lives at quarter end, reflecting year-over-year growth of 38% in the legacy VillageMD business and the addition of 309,000 value-based lives from Summit. The total includes 177,000 full-risk Medicare lives. VillageMD ended the quarter with 729 locations, including Summit Health and CityMD. The 403 clinics for the legacy VillageMD business compared to 270 at the end of the prior year period and included 210 clinics co-located with Walgreens, up from 94 co-located clinics a year ago.We were seeing benefits on the Walgreens side from our partnership with VillageMD. Roughly 50% of patients had co-located VillageMD clinics opt to get their prescriptions filled at Walgreens. VillageMD co-located sites that have been open for over two years are driving an incremental 40 scripts per site per day, and this is an increase of 35% versus prior year. We will continue to build out our Walgreens Health Corners as we add new lives and partners. We ended the quarter with 117 Health Corners, up from 47% a year ago. In summary, we are moving swiftly to implement our vision, leveraging our integrated best-in-class assets and are excited with recent developments including signing another payer partner in the Walgreens Health organic business.Turning next to cash flow. We generated over $1.2 billion of operating cash flow in the first half of '23, with free cash flow of $560 million. The year-over-year decline reflected lower earnings due to the COVID-19 headwind and increased capital expenditures related to growth initiatives. This was partially offset by ongoing working capital optimization. Turning now to guidance. We are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS guidance. We delivered a solid first half, which was broadly in line with expectations. Our core Retail Pharmacy business has performed well in both the U.S. and International as we lapped very strong prior year comps. We also drove better-than-anticipated U.S. comp script growth in the second quarter. We continue to expect robust and accelerating EPS growth in the second half and have good visibility and strong execution plans against the key drivers.COVID was a major headwind in the first half. And heading into the second half, we will see lower year-over-year impacts. In the U.S., we have clear line of sight to less reimbursement pressure relative to the first half of the year. Additionally, our script volume recovery is progressing and we are benefiting from some favorable cost of goods sold timing. In the International segment, the business is well positioned to extend the second quarter's very good performance and we are moving past the peak investment period for U.S. Healthcare. COVID vaccinations and testing do remain a wildcard as the FDA has not yet issued guidance on spring boosters. In summary, at the midpoint of the guidance range, we expect second half adjusted EPS growth in the mid-20s.With that, let me now pass it back to Roz for her closing remarks.Rosalind Brewer: Thank you, James. Before we kick off Q&amp;A, let me sum up what you've heard. We continue to execute against our fiscal 2023 plan with solid first half results broadly in line with our expectations. Our Retail Pharmacy business is performing well, and we are progressing our healthcare business to scale and profitability. We exited the quarter with acceleration in February, adding to our confidence in achieving strong growth ahead. We have good visibility into the back half drivers. As I said earlier, the inflection is here. Our bold strategic actions are working, and I'm very excited for our future. Now I'd like to open the line for questions.

Per a complaint from the NLRB complaint, Saxton was fired after leading an effort to unionize his store.Jaysin Saxton, a fired Starbucks Worker Leader from Augusta, Georgia, testifies about the company's labor and union practices during a Senate hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, March 29, 2023. (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)In the hearing, Schultz said the coffee chain has repeatedly tried to negotiate with the union, but prefers face-to-face meetings instead of over Zoom (ZM).""We don't know, if there's a Zoom meeting, who is taping the meeting, who's in the background...whether or not they are part of the company, part of the union or whatever,"" Schultz said, noting that scheduling meetings has also been difficult due to an agreement made by the union to negotiate by individual store.""We've tried to set up over 365 meetings ... It is a very difficult scheduling issue...we should not be held accountable for not showing up when all we're asking for is face-to-face bargaining.""In response to that, Saxton said, ""I don't know why that's such a sticking point for Starbucks... The shareholders can come to the meetings through Zoom. But for us workers, we are expected to show up face to face with them and these are the same people who have been intimidating and telling us that we could lose all of our benefits, threatening our livelihoods. Some of us don't want to go and sit face to face with that,"" he said.Story continuesLast week, ahead of the company's annual meeting, Narasimhan sent a letter to its employees (or what Starbucks calls partners) saying he plans to ""reinvigorate our culture around what it means to be a partner at Starbucks."" He also plans to work in stores for a half day each month to stay ""close to the culture and our customers.""At that meeting, shareholders approved a proposal for an independent third-party assessment of Starbuck's commitment to worker rights. Saxton claims Starbucks cuts hours for employees, impacting workers' ability to reach an hourly requirement for benefits.Wall Street's perspective: The hearing was a 'non-event'As far as the Street's perspective, the hearing fell by the wayside. Compared to a year ago, shares are up more than 10%. In the past five days, shares are up nearly 2.5%.Cowen's Andrew Charles said, ""We view Howard Schultz's Senate testimony as a non-event for shares and argue unionization is declining in importance,"" with a recent slowdown in the pace of unionization efforts. About 300 stores out of the total 9,000 U.S. company-owned stores have voted yes to unionize.Nick Setyan of Wedbush agreed.""Wall Street isn't going to care about this for a long time. Until it becomes like a big enough issue to care, as of right now, the consensus is that this is going to take care of itself without impacting Starbucks in a meaningful way,"" he said to Yahoo Finance.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

99,da78dbf8-c770-3821-aff5-0ae25b49f45a,SBUX,2023-03-31,I am a Starbucks barista who doesn’t qualify for all the wonderful benefits you keep hearing about. We want the ‘different kind of company’ that Howard Schultz promised but failed to deliver,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/am-starbucks-barista-doesn-t-113000003.html,1680175800,STORY,['SBUX'],"[I started working at Starbucks in December of 2021, one week after my store had its union election. I had no idea what I was walking into. I had seen the headlines about the Genesee Street and Elmwood Ave stores winning their union elections, the first Starbucks stores in the country to do so, but I had never heard of a union before–and I was intrigued to learn more about this historic victory.While I was excited to work at a place that I had frequented as a customer, my start with Starbucks was rocky. I was trained for only a few days and I felt completely unprepared to start work as a barista. This was the first red flag.While my training was subpar, my co-workers weren’t. One shift I turned to my shift supervisor, Lexi, and asked, “what’s up with all this union stuff?” She immediately gave me all the tools I needed to immerse myself fully in the campaign. She gave me a union pin and reading materials about the union. I started wearing the pin right away.Things were going great at first and my store was incredibly busy. Then January hit and the hour cuts started out of nowhere. I went from working 25 hours to 17 or 18 hours a week and some of my co-workers were only getting five to 10 hours. To qualify for benefits at Starbucks, baristas have to work at least 20 hours a week.When I asked my manager why my hours were cut so drastically, I was told that January is a slow month and that the hours would increase again in a few weeks. If I needed additional hours I could pick up shifts at other stores. I was brand new. I barely had the training to work as a barista and then I was supposed to work at other stores to get hours? I felt completely hopeless. My finances and the future of my benefits were in the company’s hands. I could have given them open availability to work but then only get scheduled for a fraction of that time.My husband works a grueling labor-intensive job. Health insurance at his company for the two of us would cost us over $1,900 a month, versus $580 through Starbucks. So not only was I struggling to get hours, but the substantial cost of the medical insurance took more than half of my paycheck at Starbucks each week. With the cost of insurance so high, even with the company’s contribution, I was basically working for nothing. How can a company claim to be progressive and tout these wonderful benefits while also controlling whether you get to keep them while on the job? Starbucks claims their benefits packages are what make them “a different kind of company” that values workers. The benefits are great on paper, but often don’t exist in reality due to inconsistent scheduling.Story continuesIt was an incredibly hard time watching my co-workers who I know and love and work with every day contemplating leaving the company or having to get a second job because they couldn’t pay their bills. Getting a second job also means my co-workers would have to change their availability, which also would put them in danger of not getting hours. It’s a vicious cycle, with Starbucks wanting all our availability but barely scheduling us for any of it.This controlling relationship is completely one-sided. With a union, we reclaim power in this dynamic. We reclaim being able to feed our families. We reclaim our dignity in the back-breaking labor we do for Starbucks every day to make the company billions of dollars in revenue.I joined this movement to be a part of history. I love working at Starbucks. I know my customers’ faces, their orders, and a little bit about their life. I love being the first interaction they have before going to work. These incredible connections I have every morning are my favorite part of the job.This union gives us hope. I don’t believe that former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz knows what it’s like to make impossible decisions about which utility he can live without until he gets paid again, or which family member or friend he can borrow money from to feed his family. If he knew how any of this felt, he would never set us up to be perpetually broken–mentally and physically.Our new CEO Laxman Narasimhan has an opportunity to chart a different course, to truly make Starbucks the “different kind of company” that Schultz failed to produce. The transition in the executive suite is a chance for Starbucks to stop its unprecedented campaign of union-busting and instead partner with us, its so-called “partners”, and our union to build a company that lives up to its stated progressive values.Jasmine Leli is a Buffalo Starbucks barista and member of Starbucks Workers United.The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.More must-read commentary published by Fortune:A recession in 2023 is now inevitable.

Last year it considered selling off its British business here altogether.Complaints about long wait times for its increasingly pricey drinks are more and more common.And at head office, the company faces charges of illegally cracking down on efforts by baristas to unionise in the US.Starbucks shareholders have since approved an independent assessment of its commitment to workers’ rights, including whether the coffee company adheres to freedom of association and collective bargaining standards.New chief Laxman Narasimhan, who took on the role last week, is tasked with reinvigorating the business and reviving a share price that has dwindled over the last two years.It is a tough task in more ways than one: Narasimhan, who was chief of Durex maker Reckitt Benckiser before taking over at the coffee chain, is succeeding legendary Starbucks chief Howard Schultz.Billionaire Schultz is credited with growing Starbucks from a small Seattle business into a coffee behemoth with more than 36,000 stores globally. The chain “truly has been my life‘s work”, he wrote in a recent open letter.However, he has proved a tough act to follow: the 69-year-old has had three stints in charge of the company, returning at key junctures to help revive Starbucks’ fortunes.One of Schultz’s final acts during his latest spell in charge was to redouble Starbucks’ commitment to Britain.Story continuesLast year executives had been considering a sale of the division after rising costs ate into its profits.UK profits dropped by a fifth to £10.4m, driven by more expensive coffee beans and higher wages for staff.That came despite inflation-busting price rises: the price of a Starbucks flat white rose by more than 12pc and faster than rivals such as Pret and Costa, according to figures from UCC Coffee.However, Starbucks has now shelved plans to sell the UK business. Instead, it plans to open 100 new stores in the UK and spend £30m doing up existing cafes.Experts believe it will need to go further to recapture momentum.“Starbucks’ weakness has always been its food,” says Jonathan De Mello, founder of JDM Retail. “The coffee offer, yeah, it's great, but food is pretty terrible.”He adds: “The lunchtime spike that other businesses get, like Pret and Greggs in particular, they don’t get. They get people buying their coffee in the morning and in the late afternoon, but they don’t get this big increase in sales at lunchtime.”Sales of well-known Starbucks products, such as its frappuccinos, have also taken a hit in recent years because of growing demand for healthier options.Jeffrey Young, managing director of coffee experts Allegra Strategies, says property companies looking to rent space to food and drink brands want something new that Starbucks may not offer.“Progressive developers are looking for young fresh brands,” he says.Narasimhan has pledged to work four hours a month as a barista in branches of Starbucks to stay connected to frontline issues like wait times, customer tastes and more. Last week he called out the wide variety of cup and lid sizes as a problem he wanted to address.“We have got to find ways to ensure that we do listen and stay connected,” the new chief told the Wall Street Journal.However, DeMello says: “Underlying all these comments about being a barista for four hours in a month and all the rest of it is heavy dissatisfaction with the state of things from a staff perspective.”Starbucks baristas protest - Ken Lambert/The Seattle Times via APIn the US, Starbucks is being raked over the coals over its treatment of employees. The company has been accused of creating a “climate of intimidation”.Schultz, who until a week ago was in charge, appeared before a US Senate committee on Wednesday where he was accused of breaking labour laws at Starbucks by blocking efforts by baristas to unionise.Senator Bernie Sanders, the far left Democrat who ran for the Presidential nomination in 2020, said: “The fundamental issue we are confronting today is whether we have a system of justice that applies to all, or whether billionaires and large corporations can break the law with impunity.”Schultz pushed back strongly, saying Starbucks had “done everything that we possibly can to respect the right under the law of our partners' ability to join a union”.But perhaps the biggest challenge facing Narasimhan is China, where Starbucks has 6,000 shops.“Half of Starbucks’ future growth is predicated on China,” says Nick Setyan, restaurant industry analyst at Wedbush Securities. “The politics of it have to be managed by someone that has the gravitas of a Schultz.”Escalating tension between China and the US, if not managed correctly, could hinder American business’ interests in the country over the years.Schultz has promised to act as a mentor to Narasimhan to help him navigate these sorts of challenges.Former Reckitt's chief Laxman Narasimhan took charge of Starbucks last week - Kaveh SardariFor Indian-born Narasimhan, the Starbucks job is the most high profile position of his career.Before a two-year stint in charge of Reckitt, Narasimhan was chief commercial officer at Pepsico and spent 19 years at McKinsey.Setyan says: “I think the most important thing here is that he has an operations background, he's managed a complicated multinational business as the chief operating officer. He knows how to handle geopolitics.”Schultz appears to have handpicked Narasimhan as his replacement, referring to him as “the future of Starbucks” in a recent open letter.Reflecting on his third stint and decision to leave, Schultz told the Wall Street Journal: “It’s not as good as it will be, and it’s not as bad as it was.”Clearly, the billionaire is hoping he is not called upon to return to Starbucks for a fourth time.Asked about allegations of clashes with workers and efforts to block unions, AJ Jones, Starbucks’ chief public affairs officer, said: “Starbucks has set itself apart as a different kind of company that lives its mission and values, every day, balancing profitability with social conscience.”What's your experience of Starbucks?

Shares have added about 5.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Monster Beverage due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Monster Beverage Q4 Earnings &amp; Sales Miss EstimatesMonster Beverage posted weak fourth-quarter 2022 results. Despite the successful global expansion of the energy drinkscategory, results were hurt by the strong US dollar, cost inflation related to increased energy costs, particularly in EMEA, ingredient and other input costs, and co-packing fees.Monster Beverage’s earnings of 57 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents and declined 4.9% year over year.Net sales of $1,513 million improved 6.2% year over year but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,589 million.Unfavorable currency translations hurt net sales by $81.9 million in the reported quarter. On a currency-adjusted basis, net sales rose 11.9%.Net sales to customers outside the United States rose 6.8% to $542.5 million, representing about 36% of the total net sales. On a currency-adjusted basis, sales to customers outside the United States improved 22.9%.Segmental PerformanceMonster Energy Drinks: The segment includes Monster Energy drinks, Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks and True North Pure Energy Seltzers. The segment’s net sales increased 2.6% year over year to $1.4 billion. The segment’s sales included a negative impact of $76.9 million from adverse currency rates. On a currency-adjusted basis, net sales for the segment rose 8.3%.Strategic Brands: In addition to the affordable energy drink brands, the segment includes a range of energy drink brands acquired from Coca-Cola. The segment’s net sales increased 41.8% year over year to $93 million in the fourth quarter.However, currency headwinds hurt the segment’s sales by $5 million. On a currency-adjusted basis, net sales for the segment increased 49.4%.Alcohol Brands: Net sales for the segment, which includes various craft beers and hard seltzers purchased as part of the CANarchy transaction on Feb 17, 2022, were $26.9 million for the fourth quarter.Other: Net sales for the segment, which includes some products of American Fruits &amp; Flavors sold to independent third parties (AFF Third-Party Products), declined 23.1% year over year to $4.6 million.Story continuesCosts &amp; MarginsThe company witnessed a significant increase in the cost of sales, which caused a decline in the gross profit and the gross margin rate. The cost of sales of $728.6 million, up 11% year over year. The increase in the cost of sales was mainly attributed to the higher logistics costs, and unfavorable geographical and product sales. Elevated ingredients and other input costs, comprising secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees, also hurt the cost of sales.The company’s fourth-quarter 2022 gross margin contracted 210 basis points (bps) to 51.8%, driven by higher ingredient and other input costs, geographical and product sales mix, and elevated logistical costs, offset partly by pricing actions. The metric increased on a sequential basis, driven by pricing actions, as well as recovery in the supply chain.Operating expenses grew 10% year over year to $390 million. The increase can be attributed to higher warehousing and other logistical expenses, elevated payroll expenses, and increased general and administrative expenses.As a percentage of sales, operating expenses rose 90 bps to 25.8%, while the metric contracted 310 bps on a three-year basis. Higher operating expense rates mainly resulted from increased distribution costs, stemming from higher warehousing expenses and other logistical expenses. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, contracted 30 bps year over year and 270 bps on a three-year basis to 9.6%.Distribution costs, as a percentage of net sales, increased 10 bps to 5% and 150 bps on a three-year basis. General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, rose 100 bps year over year, while the metric contracted 200 bps on a three-year basis to 11.1%.Operating income of $394.4 million declined 4.5% year over year, driven by a decrease in the gross margin, as well as higher operating expenses. The operating margin contracted 290 bps to 26.1% in the reported quarter.Other FinancialsMonster Beverage ended fourth-quarter 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $1,307.1 million, and total stockholders' equity of $7,025 million. Short-term investments, as of Dec 31, 2022, were $1,362.3 million, whereas long-term investments were $61.4 million.In the reported quarter, the company bought back 2.3 million shares for an average price of $89.10 per share and a total value of $201.6 million. As of Nov 3, 2022, it had $682.8 million remaining under the previously authorized share repurchase plan. Concurrently, the company authorized a share repurchase program to buy back shares worth up to an additional $500 million.The company has announced a 2-for-1 split of its common stock that will be reflected in the form of a 100% stock dividend.Each stockholder of record as of Mar 13, 2023, will receive a dividend of one additional share of common stock for each then-held share, to be distributed after the close of trading on Mar 27, 2023.Business DevelopmentsThe company has been implementing price hikes in the first half of 2023. Also, it continued to expand its brand distribution across the domestic and international markets in the fourth quarter of 2022. MNST implemented a price increase of 6% market-wide in the United States effective Sep 1, 2022, and will implement a price increase on its 24-ounce line effective Apr 1, 2023.The company also implemented price increases in the second half of 2022 in certain international markets and will implement additional price increases on a phased approach in the first half of 2023 in a number of international markets.In the United States, MNST launched Monster Energy Zero Sugar at retail in January 2023, along with the introduction of Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams, Monster (stylized) Reserve Kiwi Strawberry, Monster Energy Nitro Cosmic Peach and Java Monster Caffe Latte in early February.During the quarter, the company launched Monster Rehab Lemon tea in Japan, Monster Ultra Watermelon in Turkey, Monster Ultra Paradise in Vietnam, Predator in Malaysia, and continued the national rollout of Predator India. It intends to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC during 2023.Recently, the company launched its first flavored malt beverage alcohol product, The Beast Unleashed, in six states, available in four flavors.

Fundamentally, enterprises that carry plenty of green in their pockets should be able to navigate whatever curveballs the gatekeepers of the economy decide to throw. For that, I filtered out stocks based on their market capitalization and cash ratio.For the former metric, the thought process is fairly logical: the bigger, more established enterprises should prove more resilient under pressure. Regarding the latter, the cash ratio represents a measurement of liquidity. Per Investopedia, it calculates the company’s total cash and cash equivalents line to its current liabilities. In other words, under a theoretical scenario where an enterprise had to pay its debt using cash (or its equivalents) only, the cash ratio gives investors a decent sense of fiscal substance. With that, below are the cash-rich companies to consider.TXNTexas Instruments$178.23FNVFranco-Nevada$143.87WYNNWynn Resorts$106.90MNSTMonster Beverage$104.76GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$103.77BIDUBaidu$152.31CCJCameco$24.68InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTexas Instruments (TXN)7 Stocks to Buy Benefiting From Millennial MoneySource: ShutterstockOne of the major technology giants, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally. Since the start of the new year, TXN gained 10% of its equity value. And while it’s down nearly 3% in the trailing year, Texas Instruments improved significantly from 2022’s tech sector implosion.Moving forward, the global economy faces myriad uncertainties. Fortunately, TXN appears well-prepared for whatever lies ahead. First, the company carries a cash ratio of 3.04 on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis. As well, it enjoys a robust balance sheet. In particular, the tech giant’s Altman Z-Score pings at 12.83, indicating an extremely low risk of bankruptcy. Also, it’s a highly profitable enterprise. For example, its operating margin comes in at 51.91% while its net margin stands at 43.68%.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg TXN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $184.94, implying 3% upside potential. While it might not be wildly exciting, it’s one of the cash-rich companies to consider.Franco-Nevada (FNV)a man sitting on a chair, typing on a laptop while cash falls from the ceilingSource: ShutterstockA gold-focused royalty and streaming company, Franco-Nevada (NYSE:FNV) offers an intriguing idea for cash-rich companies. Because of its business structure, Franco-Nevada enjoys greater predictability. It’s not a mining enterprise but rather financially supports miners in exchange for a portion of revenue or metals extracted. It’s also a hefty operation, featuring a market cap of 38 billion CAD (roughly $27.5 billion).Fundamentally, the fear trade should bolster Franco-Nevada’s precious metals business. As well, the company features a cash ratio of 23.83 times on a TTM basis. Better yet, the enterprise enjoys a stout balance sheet. It features zero debt, affording flexibility for whatever troubles may materialize. Also, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 80.81, indicating practically no chance of bankruptcy within a two-year period.Also, Franco-Nevada fires on all cylinders operationally. Its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 16.2% while its net margin is up to 53.21%. Lastly, covering analysts peg FNV as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $153.20, implying 6% upside potential.Wynn Resorts (WYNN)cow made out of cash in green field with bright blue sky behind itSource: Reel2Reel/shutterstock.comBased in Las Vegas, Nevada, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) is a developer and operator of high-end hotels and casinos. Of course, during the first two years of the Covid-19 crisis, Wynn Resorts and the hospitality industry suffered substantially. However, as social dynamics such as revenge travel took hold, Wynn began putting the pieces back together. Presently, it ranks among the cash-rich companies to consider.First, Wynn features a cash ratio of 2.02. Second, Wynn may enjoy one of the better forward-looking narratives. In particular, as the global casino gaming environment normalizes – especially in Asia – Wynn could benefit handsomely. To quickly summarize, gamblers in Asia tend to gamble, offering higher revenue-making opportunities. In contrast, western gamblers gravitate toward dining and entertainment, which are less profitable to casinos.To be fair, the above narrative will require investors to ignore some ugly financial metrics that stemmed from Covid-19. However, the rewards could be robust. Right now, Wall Street analysts peg WYNN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $114.92, implying nearly 8% upside potential.Monster Beverage (MNST)Man in blue formal wear tuxedo standing as money 'rains' on him, isolated on red vivid background.Source: ShutterstockAn American beverage company, Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) specializes in energy drinks. Fundamentally, the company may benefit from the trade-down effect along with social normalization trends. Many companies have begun recalling their workers. However, as mass layoffs show, the economy isn’t holistically robust, meaning that people can’t be frivolous with their money.From this angle, Monster Beverage could represent a lower-cost alternative to getting coffee at a premium coffee shop or café. Onto the financials, Monster features a cash ratio of 2.66 on a TTM basis. In addition, the company benefits from excellent stability in the balance sheet. Notably, Monster has no debt, thus enjoying tremendous flexibility. Also, its Altman Z-Score comes out to a monstrous 28.77.Further, the enterprise enjoys strong revenue trends and excellent profitability metrics. As well, its return on equity (ROE) pings at a high of 17.48%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg MNST as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $113.64, implying over 9% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the cash-rich companies to consider.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)A man counts money he's holding.Source: ShutterstockAn internet and tech stalwart, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) routinely attracts attention and controversy. However, in 2022, the Class C GOOG stock suffered uncharacteristically sharp losses. It’s making up for lost time, gaining over 18% since the Jan. opener. However, in the trailing year, it’s down 25%. Still, despite the headwinds, Alphabet remains one of the cash-rich companies.In terms of raw numbers, Alphabet features a cash ratio of 1.64. Moreover, the tech firm enjoys a stout balance sheet. Notably, its equity-to-asset ratio pings at 0.7 times, above the sector median value of 0.65 times. As well, it features an Altman Z-Score of 9.8, indicating a very low risk of bankruptcy. Operationally, the enterprise continues to delight shareholders. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 22.9%, while its net margin dominates the sector at 21.2%.Looking to the Street, analysts peg GOOG as a unanimous strong buy. Further, their average price target hits $124.88, implying nearly 18% upside potential.Baidu (BIDU)Source: ShutterstockA Chinese multinational technology firm, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) specializes in Internet-related services and products. As well, it dove deeply into artificial intelligence, making Baidu one of the more intriguing tech enterprises. And while it’s off to a massive start to the new year (gaining over 31%), it posted a more modest 7% up in the past 365 days.To be sure, Baidu may generate some controversy because of the current geopolitical environment. Still, for politics-agnostic investors, Baidu represents one of the cash-rich companies. For starters, its cash ratio comes out to 2.19 on a TTM basis. Second, the company enjoys solid profitability. For example, its net margin is 6%, ranked above 62.48% of the interactive media industry. Also, it’s worth pointing out that the market prices BIDU at a forward multiple of 16.15. As a discount to projected earnings, Baidu ranks better than 63.16% of its peers.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg BIDU as a consensus strong buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $184.21, implying nearly 18% upside potential.Cameco (CCJ)Source: ShutterstockAlthough one of the riskiest names among cash-rich companies, Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) deserves consideration because of its relevant nuclear power business. With geopolitical flashpoints choking off western countries’ access to hydrocarbons, alternative sources of energy will likely take prominence. Nuclear power, despite its controversies, should reach front and center stage (eventually).For the adventurous investor, CCJ offers an enticing balance. For starters, the company’s cash ratio comes out to 3.64 on a TTM basis. Second, the company enjoys decent (though not great) stability in the balance sheet. Its debt-to-equity ratio is 0.17 times, favorably below the median stat of 0.27 times. Also, the company’s Altman Z-Score is 4.23, indicating low bankruptcy risk within the next two years.Admittedly, the company’s operational stats come off as rather lackluster or middling. However, as energy needs become more pronounced, CCJ could fly higher. At least, that’s what the analysts think, who pegged CCJ as a unanimous strong buy. Also, their average price target stands at $35.70, implying almost 49% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

PM, Altria Group, Inc. MO and Turning Point Brands, Inc. TPB.Industry: TobaccoLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2072268/3-tobacco-stocks-worth-watching-despite-industry-headwindsPlayers in the Tobacco industry have been seeing soft cigarette volumes, which have been affected by strict regulatory norms and limitations and rising health consciousness. Also, raw material cost inflation and supply-chain bottlenecks have been concerning. That said, strong pricing power has been an upside.Moreover, a focus on reduced risk products (RRPs) or smoke-free alternatives has been working well for companies like Philip Morris International Inc., Altria Group, Inc. and Turning Point Brands, Inc.About the IndustryThe Zacks Tobacco industry includes companies that manufacture and sell cigarettes as well as tobacco and nicotine-based products, such as cigars, snuffs and oral tobacco. Some of the companies also offer RRPs, such as e-cigarettes, vaping and heat-not-burn variants. A few of the firms are also engaged in making devices and attachments needed in vaping and heat-not-burn products.Most of the products manufactured by the tobacco industry participants fall under the strict vigilance of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and are required to follow the permissible levels of nicotine in manufacturing. Players in this space sell products mostly through large retailers, distributors, convenience stores, drugstores, wholesalers and grocery chains. Additionally, some international tobacco firms operate in the country through subsidiaries.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Tobacco IndustryStern Government Regulations: Cigarette volumes have been bearing the impacts of strict government regulations pertaining to sales, marketing and manufacturing. Such regulatory norms are imposed due to health hazards caused by the consumption of nicotine. Some of the guidelines issued by the FDA include the mandatory use of precautionary labels on cigarette packets and self-critical advertisements.Story continuesMoreover, campaigns against tobacco consumption have led to increased consumer awareness, which has resulted in lower smoking rates. Such headwinds, along with the rising health consciousness, have been adversely impacting cigarette sales volumes. Since cigarette sales account for the majority of revenues for companies in the tobacco industry, dwindling sales volumes in this category are a concern.Cost Inflation: An overall inflationary cost scenario has been hurting the performance of many industry players. Companies are witnessing elevated inflation rates due to rising global energy, commodity and food prices due to factors like demand-supply imbalances, labor shortage and the Ukraine war. Apart from these, hurdles in the supply and distribution channels stemming from the pandemic and the Ukraine war have been impacting the availability and cost of certain raw materials. Increased logistic costs remain a concern for many companies operating in the space.High Pricing a Major Upside: Industry participants have been gaining from the solid pricing power of tobacco products, which also helps them make up for high taxes and sometimes lower cigarette sales volumes. As smokers don’t mind a price hike due to their addiction, this strategy is likely to keep working for players in the tobacco space. The high pricing of cigarettes has been supporting revenues and the operating income of some of the players in the tobacco industry.Low-Risk Products Gain Prominence: Low-risk tobacco alternatives, also referred to as next-generation tobacco products, have been gaining immense popularity. Compared to cigarettes, these products are claimed to be less detrimental to health due to their scientific composition and manner of use. Consumers are increasingly taking to such products to quit cigarettes.Tobacco biggies have been witnessing substantial revenue growth in the RRP arena. The companies are making investments to expand in this category, such as undertaking innovations to make these products user-friendly and energy-efficient. The performance of tobacco players is expected to continue benefiting from RRPs.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Drab ProspectsThe Zacks Tobacco industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #217, which places it in the bottom 13% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.

Year-to-date, the index is down 1.67% and returned 11.49% in the past six months, as of March 29. Some important Dow companies include Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).The companies that make up the DJIA are leaders in their respective industries and are considered to be representative of the overall performance of the U.S. stock market. The DJIA is often used as a benchmark for the performance of the U.S. stock market as a whole, and investors and analysts use it to track the performance of individual companies and to make investment decisions. The index has shown strong performance over the past years relative to its counterpart, the S&amp;P 500. According to a report by Forbes, the index delivered an average annual return of 16.65% in three years that ended in 2019, compared with a 14.03% annualized return on the S&amp;P 500. In our previous article, we shed light on the performance of both indexes and reported that the Dow has outperformed the wider market over the last 30 years that ended June 2021. During this period, the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 10.6% return, compared with an 11.16% return of the DJIA.In the current market situation, dividend stocks are gaining a lot of traction among investors as they try to generate stable and regular income. When it comes to dividend investing, companies that have proven dividend growth track records become popular because of their strong cash flow generation and solid balance sheets. Dividend growers also dominate the market, especially during periods of high turbulence. A report by Capital Group revealed the importance of dividend stocks and mentioned that they accounted for nearly one-third of the market’s total return from 1926 to 2021. The report also mentioned that dividend growers returned 9.3% to shareholders from 1990 to 2022, with a 14.5% volatility. In comparison, non-dividend payers delivered a 4% return during the same period, with a volatility of 19.7%.

Management raised its F23 outlook to low teens currency-neutral revenue growth.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect gross and operating margin improvements as it shifts its product mix to more premium products and adopts a more direct to consumer approach, driving long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”10.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”8. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

(NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)7.

Shares have benefited from investors seeking safety in areas with less economic and interest rate sensitivity. With about one third of its sales generated by blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, the key issue for investors is the success of its large R&amp;D pipeline to replace those sales when Keytruda comes off patent in 2028. However, Merck seems to be getting little credit from investors for the 60+ programs it has in clinical development, despite having several solid and large new product opportunities.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. The use of words such as ""anticipates,"" ""expects,"" ""intends,"" ""plans,"" ""projects,"" ""looks forward,"" ""confident that,"" ""believes,"" and ""targeted,"" among others, generally identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available operating, financial, economic and other information and assumptions, and are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties. A variety of factors, many of which are beyond Mattel’s control, could cause actual future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Specific factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) Mattel's ability to design, develop, produce, manufacture, source, ship, and distribute products on a timely and cost-effective basis; (ii) sufficient interest in and demand for the products and entertainment Mattel offers by retail customers and consumers to profitably recover Mattel's costs; (iii) downturns in economic conditions affecting Mattel's markets which can negatively impact retail customers and consumers, and which can result in lower employment levels and lower consumer disposable income and spending, including lower spending on purchases of Mattel's products; (iv) other factors which can lower discretionary consumer spending, such as higher costs for fuel and food, drops in the value of homes or other consumer assets, and high levels of consumer debt; (v) potential difficulties or delays Mattel may experience in implementing cost savings and efficiency enhancing initiatives; (vi) other economic and public health conditions or regulatory changes in the markets in which Mattel and its customers and suppliers operate, which could create delays or increase Mattel's costs, such as higher commodity prices, labor costs or transportation costs, or outbreaks of disease; (vii) the effect of inflation on Mattel's business, including cost inflation in supply chain inputs and increased labor costs, as well as pricing actions taken in an effort to mitigate the effects of inflation; (viii) currency fluctuations, including movements in foreign exchange rates, which can lower Mattel's net revenues and earnings, and significantly impact Mattel's costs; (ix) the concentration of Mattel's customers, potentially increasing the negative impact to Mattel of difficulties experienced by any of Mattel's customers, such as bankruptcies or liquidations or a general lack of success, or changes in their purchasing or selling patterns; (x) the inventory policies of Mattel's retail customers, as well as the concentration of Mattel's revenues in the second half of the year, which coupled with reliance by retailers on quick response inventory management techniques, increases the risk of underproduction, overproduction, and shipping delays; (xi) legal, reputational, and financial risks related to security breaches or cyberattacks; (xii) work disruptions, including as a result of supply chain disruption such as plant or port closures, which may impact Mattel's ability to manufacture or deliver product in a timely and cost-effective manner; (xiii) the impact of competition on revenues, margins, and other aspects of Mattel's business, including the ability to offer products that consumers choose to buy instead of competitive products, the ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses from licensors of entertainment properties, and the ability to attract and retain talented employees and adapt to evolving workplace models; (xiv) the risk of product recalls or product liability suits and costs associated with product safety regulations; (xv) changes in laws or regulations in the United States and/or in other major markets, such as China, in which Mattel operates, including, without limitation, with respect to taxes, tariffs, trade policies, or product safety, which may increase Mattel's product costs and other costs of doing business, and reduce Mattel's earnings and liquidity; (xvi) business disruptions or other unforeseen impacts due to economic instability, political instability, civil unrest, armed hostilities (including the impact of the war in Ukraine), natural and man-made disasters, pandemics or other public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or other catastrophic events; (xvii) failure to realize the planned benefits from any investments or acquisitions made by Mattel; (xviii) the impact of other market conditions or third party actions or approvals, including those that result in any significant failure, inadequacy, or interruption from vendors or outsourcers, which could reduce demand for Mattel's products, delay or increase the cost of implementation of Mattel's programs, or alter Mattel's actions and reduce actual results; (xix) changes in financing markets or the inability of Mattel to obtain financing on attractive terms; (xx) the impact of litigation, arbitration, or regulatory decisions or settlement actions; (xxi) Mattel's ability to navigate regulatory frameworks in connection with new areas of investment, product development, or other business activities, such as non-fungible tokens and cryptocurrency; and (xxii) other risks and uncertainties as may be described in Mattel’s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the ""Risk Factors"" section of Mattel’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as well as in Mattel’s other public statements.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.The consumer discretionary sector took a hit last year as shoppers tend to cut back on discretionary spending when they feel the heat of inflation. As the Federal Reserve launched its rate hike onslaught to tame inflation, consumers started to tighten their belts. As of the end of 2022, the consumer discretionary subindex was down a whopping 37%, compared to a 19% decline of the S&amp;P 500 index. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 consumer staples subindex was down just by 2.7% in the period.However, the consumer discretionary sector started to post a comeback this year as the market saw a strange optimism. As of February 7, consumer discretionary was one of the top-performing sectors of the S&amp;P 500 in 2023.While the Federal Reserve has indicated its plan to keep raising interest rates in 2023 amid rising inflation and a strong labor market, some believe consumer spending will remain strong. Retail spending in January jumped 3% from December on a seasonally adjusted basis. This spending growth was surprisingly boosted by vehicles, furniture, clothing and dining out. According to a Wall Street Journal report, Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, believes consumer spending will remain strong as long as labor market, wage growth and savings rates hold up.While consumer discretionary sector is sensitive to interest rate hikes, the industry is full of companies that are paying attractive dividends. These companies are expected to benefit in the long term when the market begins to recover. That’s why investing in consumer discretionary dividend stocks which have strong yields and dividend safety is a decent bet for long-term investors.Best Consumer Discretionary Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/Story continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their stock holdings as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 and picked 15 consumer discretionary dividend stocks that had the highest number of hedge fund investors.

(NYSE:AAP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also found an opportunity to add to our existing position in Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) as the stock fell and the risk/reward profile improved. Advance underperformed early in the quarter as lower-quality sector peers bounced significantly. In August, shares fell further after the company reported second quarter earnings that disappointed because of weakerthan-expected same-store sales. Furthermore, management reduced its full-year earnings outlook by ~4%, citing softening consumer purchasing patterns within AAP’s “do-it-yourself” business.The most important driver of Advance Auto’s earnings power seems to be the management team’s ability to improve margin expansion. However, the market remains myopically focused on sales growth. The margin expansion opportunity originates from the consolidation of an overly complex and inefficient distribution network. Management is planning to roll out new distribution center. software through 2023 that will reduce costs, improve network productivity, and enhance customer experience through better inventory availability.In addition, the auto parts retailing industry tends to be less cyclical than the Consumer Discretionary sector because consumers often hold onto their used cars longer and make necessary repairs rather than buy new vehicles when their financial prospects are weakened. AAP is currently trading at less than 12 times forward earnings, well below the company’s long-term median P/E of more than 15—while having significant room to improve profitability owing to its self-help initiatives.”7.

That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”6. Vail Resorts, Inc.

Our intention was to cut costs early and give ourselves time for reassessment. We don't want to carry on with projects that we're not aligned with"", Kicinski said during a conference call on Thursday.Adam Kicinski also said that he does not see any risk of write-downs on project Polaris.Story continues""I don't see any write-down risk (...) but (...) projects like Polaris or Orion, (...) are our flagship, internal productions and the very core of everything what we do"" he said.""It is hard to imagine that we would decide to not carry on with these developments""($1 = 4.2848 zlotys) (Reporting by Adrianna Ebert and Patrycja Zaras; Editing by David Goodman, Richard Chang and David Gregorio)]"

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, long term The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) shareholders have enjoyed a 80% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 45% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 29% , including dividends .So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, TJX Companies achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 8.1% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 12% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into TJX Companies' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of TJX Companies's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for TJX Companies the TSR over the last 5 years was 93%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that TJX Companies shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 29% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 14% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Amgen (AMGN) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $4.50 a share 27 days away from its upcoming earnings release on April 26, 2023.Amgen's Earnings ESP sits at 14.54%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.50 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.93.AMGN is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Quest Diagnostics (DGX).Slated to report earnings on April 20, 2023, Quest Diagnostics holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.99 a share 21 days from its next quarterly update.For Quest Diagnostics, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 is 0.54%.Story continuesAMGN and DGX's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The net proceeds after tax from this transaction were $179 million, which will be beneficial for generating cash for the company at fair value while streamlining and optimizing its equity portfolio.After the Goldcorp acquisition in 2019, Newmont has made significant progress in maximizing value for its shareholders and other stakeholders by selling non-core assets.

After acquiring Goldcorp, Newmont sold additional royalties to Maverix in 2020, which led to the possession of 42.0 million common shares of the latter and 5.0 million purchase warrants. In January 2023, Triple Flag completed the purchase of Maverix, and as a result, NEM received 15.1 million common shares and 1.8 million purchase warrants of the combined entity. Before the sale, Newmont held around 7.5% of the outstanding common shares of Triple Flag for investment purposes.Newmont’s shares have lost 39.1% in the past year compared with a 26.1% decline of the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company, on its fourth-quarter call, stated that it expects gold production to be in the range of 5.7-6.3 million ounces for 2023.

Those that go to Production Facility 2 will continue to be sent to storage tanks for around another two weeks before being closed off.Gulf Keystone “continues to believe that the suspension of exports will be temporary,” it said.The Iraqi federal government and officials from Kurdistan are set to meet again in Baghdad next week. Those may lead to the resumption of more than 400,000 barrels a day of Iraqi oil exports that go through Turkey, a KRG official told Bloomberg.Other companies including DNO ASA and HKN Energy have already started to lower production in Kurdistan. Genel Energy Plc expects to shut down the field of Sarta this weekend, according to a company statement.Turkey closed a pipeline running from the northern Iraqi region to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan on Saturday. That was after an international business tribunal said the Kurdistan Regional Government shouldn’t export oil from the terminal without Baghdad’s approval.The Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce largely ruled against Turkey in a case brought by Iraq’s federal government. The move was part of Baghdad’s long-running attempt to rein in the KRG, which ultimately wants independence, and take more control over its oil.Brent crude has climbed 5.7% this week to above $79 a barrel, in part because of traders’ fears of a long stoppage. The US has urged the KRG and Baghdad to allow exports to restart quickly.Story continuesBaghdad says it’s up to the KRG to break the deadlock by accepting that Iraq’s state oil-marketing firm, known as SOMO, should handle Kurdish shipments from Ceyhan.Smoother RelationsThe discussions are complicated by the KRG owing hundreds of millions of dollars to oil traders, including Trafigura Group, from deals signed in the past decade.Still, relations between the KRG, based in Erbil, and Baghdad have improved since Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani became Iraq’s prime minister in October. The ICC case was brought by a previous administration.“We’ve seen talks going on even before the arbitration handed down its ruling,” said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at Energy Aspects, a consultant to energy traders. “There’s a reasonable chance for them to come up with some kind of deal that allows the restart of the pipeline sooner rather than later.”Gulf Keystone’s shares have slumped 18% this week, while those of Norway’s DNO are down 6.3%.The combined storage capacity for PF-1 and PF-2 at Shaikan is roughly 150,000 barrels, Gulf Keystone said.

Push on with rate hikes and tempt further banking sector troubles? Or press pause and risk more inflation?Two-year Treasury yields, which are highly sensitive to U.S. Federal Reserve moves, jumped from 4% to 5% in February, only to dive back to 3.5% when the SVB turmoil redrew the entire U.S. interest rate map.That hoisted U.S. bond volatility to its highest point since the 2008 meltdown. Europe too saw 2-year German yields arc from 2.5% to almost 3.5% and back, while changes at Japan's central bank have also been moving the dial.Story continues'Big Tech' stocks crave low borrowing costs so they have roared up by a third. The Nasdaq is up 18%, China tech 22%, emerging market countries have sold record amounts of debt and commodity markets see recessions coming.""All the action has been in the bond markets,"" said SEB Investment Management's global head of asset allocation Hans Peterson, explaining the shifts had been hard to navigate. ""The equity market has done impressively well considering.""COCO POPThe dollar's 1% dip is its weakest start to a year since 2018 and allowed Britain's pound and the euro to climb around 1.5%.Worldwide, Chile, Mexico, Hungary and Colombia's currencies have jumped the most - as much as 8% in Chile's case as its main export, copper, has also risen 7% as resource-hungry China has reopened and rebooted.Top of stocks in national terms is the Czech Republic with a 30% rise in dollar terms. Colombia is down 16% at the other end of the spectrum and India is down 8% having seen one of its biggest conglomerates, Adani, skewed by short sellers.Bitcoin beats the lot having surged 70%, including 40% in just 10 days during this month's SVB and Credit Suisse chaos.Banking sector woes have been kryptonite for financial stocks, however, as well as the risky breed of 'contingent convertible' (CoCo) bank bonds wiped out during Credit Suisse's rescue.The scare factor was that the bank's shareholders got some of their money back, which turned the normal hierarchy of bondholders before shareholders on its head and shattered trust in the specific 'AT1' type of CoCos that went pop.Other European banking authorities were so spooked they gave reassurances that they wouldn't do the same. CoCo debt is still down 15% however and insuring against a bank default now costs a lot more.""For the banks it was the most nervous situation we have seen for a while,"" SEB's Peterson said.DIRECTIONLESSA 42% drop in Europe's natural gas prices, a 9% fall in oil and 12% and 4% respective tumbles in wheat and corn have fed hopes of lower inflation despite the unrelenting war between producers Russia and Ukraine.Since late 2021, big developed economies including the United States, Europe and Australia have raised interest rates by almost 3,300 basis points collectively. So whether that surge halts this year remains pivotal for investors.It is crucial for many of the heavily-indebted developing world countries.

Urals crude, Russia’s key export blend, sold for $45.27 in the Black Sea, while grades such as ESPO, Sakhalin and Sokol, all of which are exported from Asia, traded above the threshold, according to the IEA.The G-7 previously agreed to review the price level in mid-March, and EU legislation stipulates that the aim should be to keep the threshold at 5% below average market rates. On that basis, a group of member states, including Poland and Estonia, had pushed to lower the threshold.Under the agreed rules, EU and G-7 companies can only provide shipping and services such as insurance needed to transport Russian oil to third countries around the world when the products have been purchased at or below the threshold. Russia is free to transport and sell oil at any price if it doesn’t use G-7 and EU services and vessels.Story continuesRussia still relies on Western insurers to cover more than half of the tanker fleet that exports its oil, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Russia Still Uses Western Insurance for Half of Oil ShipmentsHowever, EU member states were told that there was some openness to possibly making the price-cap mechanism less rigid, the people said, without specifying what that meant in practice.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekJohn Wick’s Blowout Opening Lifts Lions Gate, But It Won’t Fix StarzThe Triumph of UBS Is Also the Humbling of Swiss BankingDungeons &amp; Dragons’ Epic Quest to Finally Make MoneyCollege Students Are About to Put a Robot on the Moon Before NASASVB’s Collapse Shows the World’s Favorite Safe Asset Isn’t Risk-Free©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Fundamentally, enterprises that carry plenty of green in their pockets should be able to navigate whatever curveballs the gatekeepers of the economy decide to throw. For that, I filtered out stocks based on their market capitalization and cash ratio.For the former metric, the thought process is fairly logical: the bigger, more established enterprises should prove more resilient under pressure. Regarding the latter, the cash ratio represents a measurement of liquidity. Per Investopedia, it calculates the company’s total cash and cash equivalents line to its current liabilities. In other words, under a theoretical scenario where an enterprise had to pay its debt using cash (or its equivalents) only, the cash ratio gives investors a decent sense of fiscal substance. With that, below are the cash-rich companies to consider.TXNTexas Instruments$178.23FNVFranco-Nevada$143.87WYNNWynn Resorts$106.90MNSTMonster Beverage$104.76GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$103.77BIDUBaidu$152.31CCJCameco$24.68InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTexas Instruments (TXN)7 Stocks to Buy Benefiting From Millennial MoneySource: ShutterstockOne of the major technology giants, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally. Since the start of the new year, TXN gained 10% of its equity value. And while it’s down nearly 3% in the trailing year, Texas Instruments improved significantly from 2022’s tech sector implosion.Moving forward, the global economy faces myriad uncertainties. Fortunately, TXN appears well-prepared for whatever lies ahead. First, the company carries a cash ratio of 3.04 on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis. As well, it enjoys a robust balance sheet. In particular, the tech giant’s Altman Z-Score pings at 12.83, indicating an extremely low risk of bankruptcy. Also, it’s a highly profitable enterprise. For example, its operating margin comes in at 51.91% while its net margin stands at 43.68%.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg TXN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $184.94, implying 3% upside potential. While it might not be wildly exciting, it’s one of the cash-rich companies to consider.Franco-Nevada (FNV)a man sitting on a chair, typing on a laptop while cash falls from the ceilingSource: ShutterstockA gold-focused royalty and streaming company, Franco-Nevada (NYSE:FNV) offers an intriguing idea for cash-rich companies. Because of its business structure, Franco-Nevada enjoys greater predictability. It’s not a mining enterprise but rather financially supports miners in exchange for a portion of revenue or metals extracted. It’s also a hefty operation, featuring a market cap of 38 billion CAD (roughly $27.5 billion).Fundamentally, the fear trade should bolster Franco-Nevada’s precious metals business. As well, the company features a cash ratio of 23.83 times on a TTM basis. Better yet, the enterprise enjoys a stout balance sheet. It features zero debt, affording flexibility for whatever troubles may materialize. Also, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 80.81, indicating practically no chance of bankruptcy within a two-year period.Also, Franco-Nevada fires on all cylinders operationally. Its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 16.2% while its net margin is up to 53.21%. Lastly, covering analysts peg FNV as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $153.20, implying 6% upside potential.Wynn Resorts (WYNN)cow made out of cash in green field with bright blue sky behind itSource: Reel2Reel/shutterstock.comBased in Las Vegas, Nevada, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) is a developer and operator of high-end hotels and casinos. Of course, during the first two years of the Covid-19 crisis, Wynn Resorts and the hospitality industry suffered substantially. However, as social dynamics such as revenge travel took hold, Wynn began putting the pieces back together. Presently, it ranks among the cash-rich companies to consider.First, Wynn features a cash ratio of 2.02. Second, Wynn may enjoy one of the better forward-looking narratives. In particular, as the global casino gaming environment normalizes – especially in Asia – Wynn could benefit handsomely. To quickly summarize, gamblers in Asia tend to gamble, offering higher revenue-making opportunities. In contrast, western gamblers gravitate toward dining and entertainment, which are less profitable to casinos.To be fair, the above narrative will require investors to ignore some ugly financial metrics that stemmed from Covid-19. However, the rewards could be robust. Right now, Wall Street analysts peg WYNN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $114.92, implying nearly 8% upside potential.Monster Beverage (MNST)Man in blue formal wear tuxedo standing as money 'rains' on him, isolated on red vivid background.Source: ShutterstockAn American beverage company, Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) specializes in energy drinks. Fundamentally, the company may benefit from the trade-down effect along with social normalization trends. Many companies have begun recalling their workers. However, as mass layoffs show, the economy isn’t holistically robust, meaning that people can’t be frivolous with their money.From this angle, Monster Beverage could represent a lower-cost alternative to getting coffee at a premium coffee shop or café. Onto the financials, Monster features a cash ratio of 2.66 on a TTM basis. In addition, the company benefits from excellent stability in the balance sheet. Notably, Monster has no debt, thus enjoying tremendous flexibility. Also, its Altman Z-Score comes out to a monstrous 28.77.Further, the enterprise enjoys strong revenue trends and excellent profitability metrics. As well, its return on equity (ROE) pings at a high of 17.48%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg MNST as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $113.64, implying over 9% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the cash-rich companies to consider.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)A man counts money he's holding.Source: ShutterstockAn internet and tech stalwart, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) routinely attracts attention and controversy. However, in 2022, the Class C GOOG stock suffered uncharacteristically sharp losses. It’s making up for lost time, gaining over 18% since the Jan. opener. However, in the trailing year, it’s down 25%. Still, despite the headwinds, Alphabet remains one of the cash-rich companies.In terms of raw numbers, Alphabet features a cash ratio of 1.64. Moreover, the tech firm enjoys a stout balance sheet. Notably, its equity-to-asset ratio pings at 0.7 times, above the sector median value of 0.65 times. As well, it features an Altman Z-Score of 9.8, indicating a very low risk of bankruptcy. Operationally, the enterprise continues to delight shareholders. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 22.9%, while its net margin dominates the sector at 21.2%.Looking to the Street, analysts peg GOOG as a unanimous strong buy. Further, their average price target hits $124.88, implying nearly 18% upside potential.Baidu (BIDU)Source: ShutterstockA Chinese multinational technology firm, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) specializes in Internet-related services and products. As well, it dove deeply into artificial intelligence, making Baidu one of the more intriguing tech enterprises. And while it’s off to a massive start to the new year (gaining over 31%), it posted a more modest 7% up in the past 365 days.To be sure, Baidu may generate some controversy because of the current geopolitical environment. Still, for politics-agnostic investors, Baidu represents one of the cash-rich companies. For starters, its cash ratio comes out to 2.19 on a TTM basis. Second, the company enjoys solid profitability. For example, its net margin is 6%, ranked above 62.48% of the interactive media industry. Also, it’s worth pointing out that the market prices BIDU at a forward multiple of 16.15. As a discount to projected earnings, Baidu ranks better than 63.16% of its peers.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg BIDU as a consensus strong buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $184.21, implying nearly 18% upside potential.Cameco (CCJ)Source: ShutterstockAlthough one of the riskiest names among cash-rich companies, Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) deserves consideration because of its relevant nuclear power business. With geopolitical flashpoints choking off western countries’ access to hydrocarbons, alternative sources of energy will likely take prominence. Nuclear power, despite its controversies, should reach front and center stage (eventually).For the adventurous investor, CCJ offers an enticing balance. For starters, the company’s cash ratio comes out to 3.64 on a TTM basis. Second, the company enjoys decent (though not great) stability in the balance sheet. Its debt-to-equity ratio is 0.17 times, favorably below the median stat of 0.27 times. Also, the company’s Altman Z-Score is 4.23, indicating low bankruptcy risk within the next two years.Admittedly, the company’s operational stats come off as rather lackluster or middling. However, as energy needs become more pronounced, CCJ could fly higher. At least, that’s what the analysts think, who pegged CCJ as a unanimous strong buy. Also, their average price target stands at $35.70, implying almost 49% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, FirstEnergy has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while NextEra Energy has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that FE has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.FE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.75, while NEE has a forward P/E of 24.38. We also note that FE has a PEG ratio of 2.44. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. NEE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.70.Another notable valuation metric for FE is its P/B ratio of 2.11. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NEE has a P/B of 3.13.These metrics, and several others, help FE earn a Value grade of B, while NEE has been given a Value grade of D.Story continuesFE has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than NEE, so it seems like value investors will conclude that FE is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more cheap quarterly dividend stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to Buy.Quarterly dividend stocks are stocks that pay dividends each quarter.Companies pay dividends as a way to return excess capital back to shareholders. If a company's profit increases substantially, many companies will increase their dividend in good times. In more challenging or difficult times, company profits could decline or go negative and many companies will cut or suspend their dividends.Cheap stocks are stocks that trade for below what they normally would be worth for various reasons. Given what is an attractive valuation can change depending on a stock's specifics, sector fundamentals, and broader economic factors that change all the time, there isn't a single indicator such as forward P/E that tells whether a stock is cheap or not.Instead, the best cheap stocks to buy are arguably blue chip stocks with substantial competitive advantages and also growth potential that are trading for fair or low valuations. Blue chips are established companies with competitive advantages that are well known and generally are pretty profitable. For those of you interested, check out 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Given the recent failure of Silicon Valley Bank and several other banks, the stock prices of many leading blue chip stocks in financial sector have declined. As a result, some leading financial blue chip stocks that are the leaders in their sectors could be trading at attractive valuations in the long term if economic conditions normalize. Financial stocks may have near term downside risk, however, if more banks fail or if the economy slows more than expected.For some companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), the stocks trade for higher forward P/E ratios but are still nevertheless considered cheap given their growth potential due to the growth of AI.Story continuesAccording to Goldman Sachs, generative AI could eventually increase annual global GDP by 7% at some point in the future with productivity increases.If AI continues to improve, AI could potentially increase the production and services significantly further in the long term.As a result of AI's potential, demand for semiconductors which are needed to power AI will likely increase and essential semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) which is at least several years ahead of its competition will likely benefit from the increases in demand. For those of you interested, check out 10 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy.Similarly, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will likely benefit from the growth in AI given it can incorporate AI into much of its software to make it more useful. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) can also benefit from AI given it owns a leading cloud business that can power many AI applications as well. AI like ChatGPT currently still makes mistakes which limits its effectiveness, but the AI is improving and will improve further in the future.Given any sector can change substantially in the future and any single company can fall behind for a variety of reasons, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Real Estate, BuildingPhoto by sean pollock on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 14 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to Buy, we picked 14 stocks with competitive advantages and growth potential that arguably trade for arguably attractive valuations.We ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that owned shares in the same stock at the end of Q4.For those of you interested, check out 13 Best Long Term Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.14 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to Buy14.

Although ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) has a forward P/E ratio of 27.25 and a dividend yield of 1.51% as of 3/29, demand for advanced semiconductors is expected to grow substantially in the long term, and demand for ASML Holding N.V.

(NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Dividend Yield as of 3/29: 2.95%The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares are down over 10.29% year to date and have a forward P/E ratio of 16.85 as of March 29 given the sluggish growth expected in the home improvement industry this year.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the fourth quarter, Matrix’s Large Cap Value Portfolio rebounded from the difficult 9 months period of the year and performed in line with the S&amp;P 500 Index but lagged the Russell 1000 Value Index. For the full year, the LCV portfolio modestly lagged the S&amp;P 500 Index and significantly lagged the Russell 1000 Value Index. The Matrix Dividend Income portfolio performed in line with the Russell 1000 Value index and well ahead of the S&amp;P 500 in the quarter. In 2022 MDI portfolio navigated well in the bear market and performed well ahead of the S&amp;P 500 Index and outperformed the Russell 1000 Value Index. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2022.Matrix Asset Advisors highlighted stocks like Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) in the Q4 2022 investor letter. Headquartered in Springdale, Arkansas, Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) is a food company that operates through Beef, Pork, Chicken, and Prepared Foods segments. On March 29, 2023, Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) stock closed at $58.25 per share. One-month return of Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) was -1.37%, and its shares lost 35.01% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) has a market capitalization of $20.858 billion.Matrix Asset Advisors made the following comment about Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:""In the 4th quarter, we started a new position in Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) and added to Morgan Stanley (MS).Tyson Foods is one of the world’s largest chicken, beef, pork, and prepared foods companies. Major customers include grocery chains, wholesale clubs, food distributors, fast-food franchises, and military commissaries. Walmart is its largest customer, accounting for more than 18% of fiscal 2021 sales. Tyson’s share price topped out at over $100 in February of 2022. Since then, the shares dropped below $65 on falling earnings estimates for the upcoming year. Some of the reasons for the earnings are falling beef prices, rising commodity prices, foreign exchange, and higher investment spending. But the big picture is that the company has an outstanding long-term record of earnings and dividend growth, a strong balance sheet, and a valuation now at a multiyear low with a dividend yield of 3%. The company should benefit from the growing worldwide demand for protein. Exports generated just 10% of fiscal 2021 sales, providing a long runway for growth.""Story continuesTyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 31 hedge fund portfolios held Tyson Foods, Inc.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Cheap Beginner Stocks to Buy.Morgan Stanley's Big Bear: ""It's Just A Much Less Predictable World""On March 27 Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist, Mike Wilson, gave an interview to Bloomberg where he discussed his view of the markets right now. Wilson noted that the bond market is not moving in coherence with the Fed, and he thinks the equities market will follow this trajectory. Here are some comments from Mike Wilson:""It's just a much less predictable world, and this has been our theme for the last couple of years, that we're entering a period of economic volatility. The last 20 years has been a world of repression where all of these metrics were somewhat predictable, and that's for companies, that's for the Fed itself, that's for investors. And now we're entering a world when it's just not as predictable, and that means higher risk premiums. Whether we're talking about credit, whether we're talking about term premium in the bond market, or we're talking about equity risk premium. In our view, I think people are operating as if we're gonna go back to that predictable world and that's, I think, misplaced.""Mike Wilson said that the degradation in multiples that stocks had last year was due to higher interest rates and not higher risk premiums. According to Wilson, the market has started to ""revalue, or devalue, the companies that are most at risk of missing estimates"". The companies that are expected to come under pressure in a high interest rate environment and are most at risk of missing estimates, according to Wilson, include small-cap, lower quality, and cyclical companies.Moreover, Mike Wilson pointed out that tech companies experienced significant declines in their stock prices last year due to their high valuations and sensitivity to rising interest rates. While these companies have cut costs, which has led to them rallying, Wilson believes that there are still risks associated with investing in them especially given the potential for further cost pressures.Story continuesThere are some areas within the market that Mike Wilson thinks have repriced and are presenting an opportunity. The financials segment has ""repriced in a meaningful way"", said Wilson. Moreover, some consumer-focused businesses and the retail segment have also repriced. Mike Wilson thinks there are opportunities in individual stocks, as opposed to indices, which do not look as attractive to him at this point in time.Finally, Mike Wilson thinks that valuations will reset over the next two quarters. However, he also said that he does not think stock valuations will stay low for long, and this is not a ""secular structural bear market"", it is actually a ""cyclical bear market"" and there is enough liquidity to stabilize things.The markets are extremely volatile and uncertain right now, given sticky inflation and a hawkish Fed. In times like these, retail investors can feel overwhelmed when it comes to investing in the stock market. However, looking at where institutional investors are parking cash can be insightful, as they have the resources and expertise to make sensical investment decisions. We have compiled a list of the 15 cheap beginner stocks to buy now according to hedge funds, which include QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). Let's now discuss these, among others, in detail.15 Cheap Beginner Stocks to BuyPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe scanned Insider Monkey's database, which tracks over 900 elite hedge funds as of Q4 2022, to find the 50 most popular stocks among institutional investors. We then checked each stock's trailing twelve-month price-to-earnings ratio from Yahoo Finance and narrowed down our selection to the 15 stocks that had a TTM PE ratio of less than 15, as of March 28, and were the most widely held by money managers.The idea was to identify cheap stocks that are safe for beginner investors who want to avoid volatility and risks.We have ranked these stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them. Where the number of hedge funds were the same, we used the PE ratio as the tie-breaker.Cheap Beginner Stocks to Buy15. Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY)PE Ratio (TTM) as of March 28: 5.02Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71As of March 28, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is trading at a PE multiple of 5x and is offering investors a forward dividend yield of 1.21%.

Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy. For the first three quarters of the year, we should change the name of our fund to the Jed Clampett Fund. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), was one of the standouts. Up through the bear market came a “bubblin’ crude!”14. Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR)PE Ratio (TTM) as of March 28: 11.18 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Charter Communications, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CHTR) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Cable stocks have been pressured for the past year as broadband growth has slowed following a pull forward of demand during the pandemic and the industry faces rising competition from wireless carriers offering fixed wireless access. In particular, shares of Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) were pressured by its recently announced multiyear capex plan to accelerate network upgrades. While this reduces free cash flow available for buybacks in the medium term, it sustains the company’s competitive advantage and should accelerate long term growth. The company also has ambitious goals to expand its footprint into adjacent and rural markets, taking advantage of the federal and state broadband subsidies. We added opportunistically to Charter on the pullback.”Other cheap stocks that are on hedge funds' radars right now include QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).13.

(NASDAQ:MU) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”12. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

(NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)11. Biogen Inc.

Cigna Healthcare provides health insurance products, including a business in which Cigna provides administrative services only to plan sponsors (employers, unions, and other groups). Evernorth provides a portfolio of health care services, including pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services, care delivery services, data and analytics solutions, and distribution of specialty drugs. Each segment has a portion of business that provides steady, predictable growth. These foundational businesses, which account for roughly 60% of total revenue, include the U.S. commercial business, the PBM business, and international. The other 40% of revenue comes from higher-growth businesses, including the specialty pharmacy business, care delivery services, and Medicare Advantage. Management targets 10% to 13% annual EPS growth over the long term. The stock trades at a significant discount to industry peers because of the company’s commercial health insurance and PBM business mix. We think the PBM business will benefit from the biosimilar wave in the next few years, and as Cigna’s higher growth businesses become a bigger percentage of the overall mix, we think the stock can appreciate at least in line with its annual EPS growth with potential for valuation expansion.”8.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 78% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Lockheed Martin. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lockheed Martin?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Lockheed Martin already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Lockheed Martin, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Lockheed Martin. The company's largest shareholder is State Street Global Advisors, Inc., with ownership of 15%. With 8.9% and 7.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 13 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Lockheed Martin Corporation in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$93m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 22% stake in Lockheed Martin. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

Here are questions and answers about Black Hawks:WHAT IS THE BLACK HAWK?The Black Hawk is a twin-engine, four-bladed, medium-lift, utility helicopter developed for the U.S. Army since the 1970s by Sikorsky Aircraft of Stratford, Connecticut. It typically has a crew of two pilots and two crew chiefs. Its basic Army designation is H-60; export versions are designated S-70.WHAT IS IT USED FOR?The Black Hawk is built in multiple configurations for a wide range of missions including cargo lift, combat assault, special operations, search-and-rescue, medical evacuation, aerial firefighting and VIP transport, according to Lockheed Martin, parent of Sikorsky. In addition to the crew, it can seat 12 fully equipped troops. Seats can be replaced with stretchers to carry wounded. Armed versions can carry guns, rockets and guided missiles.WHO USES THE BLACK HAWK?The Black Hawk is a workhorse for the U.S. Army, which operates more than 2,100 of the aircraft, as well as other U.S. forces and the militaries of dozens of other nations, according to Lockheed Martin. U.S. variants include the Navy's Seahawk, the Air Force's Pave Hawk and the Coast Guard's Jayhawk. A non-military version used for fighting wildfires is called the Firehawk.HOW MUCH DO BLACK HAWKS COST?In 2022, the U.S. government and Sikorsky signed a five-year contract for 120 Black Hawks, with options for a total of 255 aircraft for the U.S. Army and foreign militaries. The contract was valued at $2.3 billion for the expected deliveries and up to $4.4 billion if all options are exercised, Lockheed Martin said in a news release. The signing marked the 10th multiyear contract between the U.S. and Sikorsky for H-60 helicopters.]"

The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., has awarded the deal.Valued at $619.2 million, this contract involves hardware delivery related to the production of the AN/SPY-6(V) family of radars. The work related to this deal will be carried out at multiple locations across the United States and is scheduled to be completed by September 2026.What's Favoring Raytheon Technologies?In recent times, nations have increased their defense spending on military equipment and weaponry to modernize and upgrade defense systems amid rising geopolitical tensions. In such a scenario, radars, which ensure efficient military surveillance and reconnaissance, tend to play an important role in military missions. Backed by such importance in military missions, radars are likely to witness fortified demand in the days ahead.Amid such an increased demand expectation, Raytheon Technologies’ expertise in manufacturing technologically advanced radars may provide an edge to the company for a large inflow of orders. Raytheon has a comprehensive range of radars like APG-79, APG-82, B-52 AESA radars, etc., which allows the company to take advantage of the lucrative radar market.Backed by such efficiency in manufacturing radars and Raytheon’s continuous investment strategy to improve the technology, the company enjoys a solid inflow of contracts, like the latest one involving the production of radars and providing other related support. This offers RTX a bright revenue generation prospect from the radar arena, which may bolster its overall top line.Growth ProspectsPer the reports from Mordor Intelligence, the military radar market is expected to witness a CAGR of 4.7% from 2023 to 2028. The expanding market size expectation supports the growth of Raytheon in the military radar market.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned 0% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, to which Lockheed belongs, has lost 0.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Lockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.13 per share, indicating a change of -4.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $26.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -1.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.12 indicates a change of +4.8% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Lockheed is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for LMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.91 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $65.8 billion and $67.74 billion estimates indicate -0.3% and +3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryLockheed reported revenues of $18.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.1%. EPS of $7.79 for the same period compares with $7.24 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.25 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.06%. The EPS surprise was +5.13%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Lockheed is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, or DJIA, is a stock market index that tracks 30 prominent American companies listed on the US stock exchanges. Year-to-date, the index is down 1.67% and returned 11.49% in the past six months, as of March 29. Some important Dow companies include Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).The companies that make up the DJIA are leaders in their respective industries and are considered to be representative of the overall performance of the U.S. stock market. The DJIA is often used as a benchmark for the performance of the U.S. stock market as a whole, and investors and analysts use it to track the performance of individual companies and to make investment decisions. The index has shown strong performance over the past years relative to its counterpart, the S&amp;P 500. According to a report by Forbes, the index delivered an average annual return of 16.65% in three years that ended in 2019, compared with a 14.03% annualized return on the S&amp;P 500. In our previous article, we shed light on the performance of both indexes and reported that the Dow has outperformed the wider market over the last 30 years that ended June 2021. During this period, the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 10.6% return, compared with an 11.16% return of the DJIA.In the current market situation, dividend stocks are gaining a lot of traction among investors as they try to generate stable and regular income. When it comes to dividend investing, companies that have proven dividend growth track records become popular because of their strong cash flow generation and solid balance sheets. Dividend growers also dominate the market, especially during periods of high turbulence. A report by Capital Group revealed the importance of dividend stocks and mentioned that they accounted for nearly one-third of the market’s total return from 1926 to 2021. The report also mentioned that dividend growers returned 9.3% to shareholders from 1990 to 2022, with a 14.5% volatility. In comparison, non-dividend payers delivered a 4% return during the same period, with a volatility of 19.7%. To know more about dividend growers, readers can have a look at 15 Dividend Growth Stocks with Highest Rates.Story continues11 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Hedge FundsTechnology share chartOur Methodology:Almost all companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average pay dividends to shareholders. However, for this list, we selected companies from the index that are popular among elite funds. We analyzed Insider Monkey's database of Q4 2022 for measuring hedge fund sentiment around each stock.Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds11. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is an Oregon-based multinational footwear manufacturing company that also manufactures apparel, equipment, and other related accessories. In fiscal Q3 2022, the company posted revenue of $12.4 billion, which showed a 14% growth from the same period last year. During the quarter, the company paid $528 million to shareholders in dividends, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are some other popular dividend stocks in DJIA.Following the company's recent quarterly earnings, Morgan Stanley maintained an Overweight rating on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in March with a $130 price target.NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share, having raised it by 12% in November 2022. Through this increase, the company took its dividend growth streak to 21 years. The stock has a dividend yield of 1.15%, as of March 29.At the end of Q4 2022, 71 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), up from 70 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $4 billion.RiverPark Advisors mentioned NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares were a top contributor for 4Q as the company reported solid 2Q23 results and raised its annual guidance. Nike reported 17% revenue growth (27% on a currency neutral basis) and $0.85 EPS, both significantly greater than expectations. Management raised its F23 outlook to low teens currency-neutral revenue growth.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect gross and operating margin improvements as it shifts its product mix to more premium products and adopts a more direct to consumer approach, driving long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”10. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an American financial services company that specializes in payment cards. The company raised its quarterly dividend by 15% on March 9 to $0.60 per share. It has been making regular dividend payments to shareholders for the past 30 years.

The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74An American multinational consumer goods corporation, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks. JPMorgan upgraded the stock to Overweight in March and also raised its price target on the stock to $155.

Among these hedge funds, Bridgewater Associates was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q4.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”8. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a New York-based multinational investment banking company that also provides other financial services to its consumers. The company is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as it returned over $3.2 billion to shareholders in dividends.The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $2.50 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.14%, as of March 29.BofA gave a positive outlook on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

(NYSE:GS), up from 69 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is roughly $5 billion.Here is what Manole Capital Management had to say about The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)7. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is an American multinational pharmaceutical company, based in New Jersey.

(NYSE:MRK), with a total value of over $5 billion. Citadel Investment Group was the company's largest shareholder in Q4.Artisan Partners mentioned Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a provider of health care solutions including prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, animal health and consumer care products. Shares have benefited from investors seeking safety in areas with less economic and interest rate sensitivity. With about one third of its sales generated by blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, the key issue for investors is the success of its large R&amp;D pipeline to replace those sales when Keytruda comes off patent in 2028. However, Merck seems to be getting little credit from investors for the 60+ programs it has in clinical development, despite having several solid and large new product opportunities. Additionally, the company’s strong balance sheet and robust free cash flow provide it multiple options for future partnerships and acquisitions, besides return of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.”6.

To see more such companies, go directly to Starter Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Stocks To Buy.Amid the current market turmoil which seems to have no end in sight, it feels weird to label anything as “safe,” especially stocks, which are spooking investors more and more, forcing them to pull money from the stock market and invest in other investment vehicles. A Wall Street Journal report earlier this month quoted  a survey from Bank of America, which said that fund managers’ allocation of stocks is now at about 2.2 standard deviations below its long-term average. The report said that instead of stocks, fund managers are gaining more exposure to bonds, emerging markets, cash and commodities.However, for those who are still interested in investing in the stock market, there’s almost a consensus among analysts that short-term market cycles should not blur your long-term outlook.""Don't Fear the Bear""According to an Edward Jones report titled “Don’t Fear The Bear,” from 1900 through 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) has had an average annual return of 9.9%, including dividends. The report said that investors should invest in quality stocks and should not worry about the short-term bear markets.“Instead of worrying about the timing of the next bear market, prepare your portfolio today with an appropriate mix of quality investments so you can stay invested in both bear and bull markets over time”When it comes to investment options for beginners, ETFs have gained a lot of popularity over the past few years, thanks to the wider exposure they provide to a basket of stocks with limited risks. One of the biggest benefits of investing in ETFs is that they give you exposure to a wide range of stocks in budget. Investing in ETFs also saves you a lot of money in transaction fees that comes with trading individual stocks. When you are investing ETFs, your transactions fees is limited when compared to stocks and mutual funds.Story continuesThe Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF is one of the most recommended ETFs for beginner investors since the ETF is composed of low-risk, high-quality stocks that are considered the safest. For this article, we scanned the top holdings of the ETF and picked 15 stocks that are considered the safest for beginner investors. We started from the top of the ETF’s holdings and picked stocks that are dominating their industries and have strong dividend histories.

Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57With over 35 years of consistent dividend increases and a dividend yield of over 3.5%, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is one of the best and safest stocks to buy for beginners. Recently, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar increased the price target of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock to $206 from $200 and kept a Buy rating.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 57 hedge funds out of the 943 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). The total value of these stakes was $32 billion. A whopping $29 billion of these $32 billion stakes was owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.Carillon Eagle Growth &amp; Income Fund made the following comment about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)  in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Energy performed well during the fourth quarter, with the sector up about 23%. Investors returned to the sector after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) signaled it would reduce production. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) reported strong quarterly results while buying back stock, paying a healthy dividend, and maintaining a strong balance sheet.”14. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the best defensive stock picks for a recessionary environment according to several analysts. Last month, Citi started covering The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) with a Buy rating and a $68 price target. During the same month, Morgan Stanley kept an Overweight rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) but raised its price target to $70.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 58 hedge funds had stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) according to Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds. The biggest stakeholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  (NYSE:BRK-B) which had a $25 billion stake.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”13. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62With years of consistent dividend increases and a solid underlying business, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is one of the best picks for any starter stock portfolio.Recently, UBS ran a machine-learning model to select its top dividend picks. Unsurprisingly, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) made it to the list of these dividend stocks.The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) recently posted weak Q4 results. But several Wall Street analysts kept their optimistic view of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD). For example, BofA’s Elizabeth Suzuki said that The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)’s 2023 guidance may be overly conservative.The analyst expects home investment to remain above pre-COVID levels as she believes the “tailwinds for the home improvement industry are generally favorable.”Matrix Asset Advisors made the following comment about The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“During the quarter, we re-established a position in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) sold earlier this year, after the shares declined sharply on big picture concerns about a softer housing market and lower consumer spending. We believe that HD is a very well-managed company, positioned to continue showing good profits even as the economy decelerates. The products it carries in inventory are in year-round demand from contractors and homeowners wanting to maintain and improve their homes. The company has historically been shareholder friendly, repurchasing shares and increasing the dividend, most recently by 15% earlier this year. On September 30, HD’s current dividend yield was 2.8%.”12. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the stocks that remain stable even during recessions and high inflation. Recently, Bank of America said that food inflation could provide an upside potential to several grocery stocks and warehouse clubs like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST).At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 66 hedge funds had stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). The total value of these stakes was $3.4 billion.Madison Funds made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has raised its dividends consecutively for 50 years. The biggest retailer in the US has a stable business and long-term growth catalysts. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was among the “sleep at night” stocks picked up by BofA’s dividend growers screen recently.10. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73With several drugs in the pipeline and a solid dividend history, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is one of the best stock picks for starters. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a member of the S&amp;P Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks companies that have annually increased their dividend for at least 25 consecutive years.Earlier this year, Guggenheim started covering AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) with a Buy rating and a $172 price target.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 73 hedge funds had stakes in AbbVie Inc.

(NYSE:ABBV) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a global biopharmaceutical company that develops and markets drugs in areas such as immunology. virology and oncology. Recently, the company expanded through the acquisition of Allergan, which added robust growth assets to help offset the loss of U.S. patent protection for Humira, a leading treatment used for rheumatology, dermatology. gastroenterology, and ophthalmology. While AbbVie reported weak third quarter revenues across the board, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vraylar (an antipsychotic treatment) in December. Despite concerns around Humira’s loss of patent protection, we believe AbbVie has significantly diversified its revenue and that its launch of Rinvog for psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis could be promising.”9. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been upping its dividends for 66 years without a break. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) ranks 9th in our list of the safest stocks for starter stock portfolios.Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank selected The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as one of its top picks in the consumer packaged goods category.Another bullish call for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) recently came from JPMorgan, where analyst Andrea Teixeria upgraded the company shares to Overweight from Neutral.Out of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 74 hedge funds had stakes in The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). The biggest stakeholder of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates which had a $757 million stake in the company.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75What makes Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) an ideal pick for beginner investors looking for safe stocks is the company’s presence in several important healthcare sectors and a diversified business. Recently, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) said it will buy Seagen, an oncology-focused biotech company, for $43 billion.Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has a huge pipeline. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is making treatments for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular diseases in addition to making vaccines. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is also working on treatments for rare diseases like hemophilia, Huntington's disease, and sickle cell anemia.Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”7. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Pharma giant Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) ranks 7th in our list of the best starter stock portfolio picks. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has increased its dividend for over a decade now.Recently, Berenberg analyst Luisa Hector increased Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)’s price target to $130 from $125 and kept a Buy rating. The analyst believes Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has room to run after ""significant de-risking"" of the company's cardiovascular pipeline.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 77 hedge funds had stakes in Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), according to Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds.Artisan Value Fund made the following comment about Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a provider of health care solutions including prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, animal health and consumer care products. Shares have benefited from investors seeking safety in areas with less economic and interest rate sensitivity. With about one third of its sales generated by blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, the key issue for investors is the success of its large R&amp;D pipeline to replace those sales when Keytruda comes off patent in 2028. However, Merck seems to be getting little credit from investors for the 60+ programs it has in clinical development, despite having several solid and large new product opportunities. Additionally, the company’s strong balance sheet and robust free cash flow provide it multiple options for future partnerships and acquisitions, besides return of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.”6. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 79While Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) shares have seen a lot of see-saw movements this year, it remains one of the safest stocks for starters for several reasons. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is a solid dividend payer, and it is expected to continue seeing huge demand for oil in the years to come. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is also investing heavily in the clean energy sector to diversify its operations for the future.

Management raised its F23 outlook to low teens currency-neutral revenue growth.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect gross and operating margin improvements as it shifts its product mix to more premium products and adopts a more direct to consumer approach, driving long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”10.

Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”8. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

(NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)7.

The conversion from an accelerated to a full (regular) approval is based on results from the Phase 2 KEYNOTE-158, KEYNOTE-164 and KEYNOTE-051 trials and includes data in 504 adult and pediatric patients across more than 30 types of cancer. This marks the first full approval for an immunotherapy based on a predictive biomarker, regardless of solid tumor type.""This approval reinforces the important role of KEYTRUDA in certain patients with MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors facing a variety of cancers,"" said Dr. Luis A. Diaz, Jr., head of the Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. ""These data also further underscore the need for biomarker testing to identify patients who may be eligible for this therapy.""Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue and can affect more than one body system simultaneously. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time during or after treatment with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, dermatologic reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management of immune- mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of KEYTRUDA. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or permanently discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see ""Selected Important Safety Information"" below.Story continues""Today’s approval builds on the 2017 accelerated approval of KEYTRUDA as the first immunotherapy with a tumor agnostic indication and supports the role of KEYTRUDA as an effective immunotherapy option based on a pan-tumor predictive biomarker,"" said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""This milestone reflects Merck’s longstanding commitment to biomarker research and personalizing treatment strategies for patients.""Data supporting the approvalThe full approval was based on data from three multicenter, non-randomized, open-label multi-cohort trials. KEYNOTE-164 (NCT02460198) enrolled 124 patients with advanced MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer that progressed following treatment with fluoropyrimidine and either oxaliplatin or irinotecan with or without anti-VEGF/EGFR mAb-based therapy. KEYNOTE-158 (NCT02628067) enrolled 373 patients with advanced MSI-H/dMMR non-colorectal cancers who had disease progression following prior therapy. Patients were either prospectively enrolled with MSI-H/dMMR tumors (Cohort K) or retrospectively identified in one of 10 solid tumor cohorts (Cohorts A-J). KEYNOTE-051 (NCT02332668) enrolled seven pediatric patients with MSI-H/dMMR cancers. All trials excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Regardless of histology, MSI or MMR tumor status was determined using polymerase chain reaction (local or central) or immunohistochemistry (local or central), respectively.Adult patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg administered intravenously every three weeks (pediatric patients received 2 mg/kg every three weeks) until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression or a maximum of 24 months. In KEYNOTE‑164 and KEYNOTE‑158, assessment of tumor status was performed every nine weeks through the first year, then every 12 weeks thereafter. In KEYNOTE‑051, assessment of tumor status was performed every eight weeks for 24 weeks, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as assessed by blinded independent central review according to RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of five target lesions per organ in KEYNOTE-158) and as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 in KEYNOTE-051.In a pooled analysis of the three trials, KEYTRUDA demonstrated an ORR of 33.3% (95% CI, 29.2-37.6), including a complete response rate of 10.3% and partial response rate of 23.0% at a median follow-up time of 20.1 months (range, 0.1 to 71.4 months). Of the responding patients (n=168), 77% had responses lasting 12 months or longer, and 39% had responses lasting 36 months or longer. Median DOR was 63.2 months (range, 1.9+ to 63.9+ months).In patients with MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer (n=124), KEYTRUDA demonstrated an ORR of 34% (95% CI, 26%-43%) with a DOR ranging from 4.4 to 58.5+ months. In patients with other MSI-H/dMMR non-colorectal solid tumors (n=380), which included endometrial cancer, gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer, small intestinal cancer, brain cancer, ovarian cancer, biliary cancer, pancreatic cancer, sarcoma, breast cancer, cervical cancer, neuroendocrine cancer, prostate cancer, adrenocortical cancer, mesothelioma, thyroid cancer, small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, salivary cancer, renal cell cancer and other cancers (including anal cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, retroperitoneal cancer, testicular cancer, vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer, appendiceal adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, carcinoma not-otherwise-specified and carcinoma of unknown origin), KEYTRUDA demonstrated an overall ORR of 33% (95% CI: 28%-38%) with a duration of response ranging from 1.9+ to 63.9+ months.In KEYNOTE-158 and KEYNOTE-164, the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 6.2 months (range, 1 day to 53.5 months). In KEYNOTE-051, the median duration of exposure was 2.1 months (range: 1 day to 25 months).About Microsatellite Instability-High (MSI-H) and Deficient Mismatch Repair (dMMR)Microsatellite instability (MSI) and dMMR are biomarkers that have been identified in many different types of cancer and that can be hereditary or random. MSI is a change that occurs in the DNA of certain cells, such as cancer cells, in which the number of repeated DNA bases in a microsatellite (which is a short, repeated sequence of DNA) is different from what it was when the microsatellite was inherited. dMMR describes cells that have mutations in certain genes involved in correcting mistakes made when DNA is copied into a cell when dividing. MSI-H and dMMR can occur when a cell is unable to repair mistakes during that division process.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.MelanomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis.

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

(NYSE:ROK) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 82% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-automation-inc-nyse-rok-132322581.html,1680182602,STORY,['ROK'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Rockwell Automation implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceThe top 22 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have been selling lately To get a sense of who is truly in control of Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 82% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Rockwell Automation. View our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Rockwell Automation?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Rockwell Automation. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Rockwell Automation, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Rockwell Automation. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 12% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.8% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.5% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 22 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Rockwell AutomationWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Rockwell Automation, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$73m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 18% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Rockwell Automation. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

For more such countries, go to 5 Countries That Produce The Best Engineers in the World. The field of engineering is the bedrock of modern civilization, right from the industrial revolution to the information revolution. Engineering is directly responsible for technological progress, with the latter being critical to Total Factor Productivity (TFP), which, in turn, has a strong correlation of 60% with economic progress in advanced countries. As manufacturing has primarily moved to emerging economies, with advanced economies largely being services-based, the demand for software engineers is higher in the latter. It is demonstrated by an Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) report, which shows that the pursuit of electrical engineering degrees has dropped by 90%, offset by a 90% increase in computer science graduations in the US over the past 50 years. However, generally, interest in STEM fields is on the decline in the US. It was already low among girls, but has been declining for boys as well. According to an IET survey in 2019, young pupils’ interest in domains like design and technology, and Information and Communications Technology is down 12% and 14%, respectively. The trend of declining interest is long-term, which is directly contributing to the shortage of engineers, with other factors being an aging workforce, the broader labor shortage and many engineers taking up managerial roles. The Bureau of Labor Statistics sees a shortage of a total of 6 million engineers in the US between 2016-2026. Despite the problems, the US is one of the best countries when it comes to most engineering fields. It is due to a world class private education system, high-tech employment opportunities and infrastructure. Some of the most notable companies in the US, like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) hire engineers from diverse fields like electrical, software, aerospace and materials engineering. Further, these companies provide opportunities to work on cutting-edge technology while paying lucrative salary packages, which are higher than the market average. Story continuesFor instance, according to Indeed, the median salary that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) pays its electrical engineers is $129,000. On the other hand, the average salary that Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) pays to its engineers is 22% higher than the market average.Lastly, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) pays its engineers an average of $96,364 a year, which is 20% higher than the national average.

In the past 10 years, for example, the number of skilled Indian immigrants working in the country in engineering fields has grown by 558%.Engineering Outlook: USAccording to BLS, 139,300 engineering jobs (excluding software engineering) will be added in the US during the forecast period of 2016-2026, with civil engineering jobs comprising the largest share, at 23%, owing to the ongoing overhauling of the infrastructure in the country. Civil engineering jobs are followed by mechanical, industrial and electrical engineering jobs. Agricultural engineering jobs comprise the lowest share in the US in the projected period, with expected growth of only 200 jobs from 2016-2026. In addition, agricultural engineers’ wages are also the lowest among engineering wages, with the median annual income being $73,640.With that said, let’s move on to 15 countries that produce the best engineers in the world. 15 Countries That Produce the Best Engineers in the WorldChristian Lagerek/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe’ve defined ‘best countries in engineering’ as ones which have high-quality Knowledge and Technology (KT) output in the engineering fields as well as advanced and impactful research, signifying the quality of engineers. We picked up the countries' overall rankings from the Global Innovation Index of 2021, and their rankings in H-Index for engineering papers from the Scimago Journal and Country Rank. We then calculated the averages of the countries' rankings on the two indexes and ranked them based on their average rankings in ascending order of high quality engineering.The global innovation index measures the quality of variables like human capital, infrastructure, business sophistication, academic institution, and KT output. The H-index metric from Scimago, on the other hand, gauges the aggregate impact of scholarly output. It lets us know which countries' engineers are leading their respective fields in research and development. An H-index of 20 means that for all academic publications by an engineer, 20 of them have been referred to by other researchers at-least 20 times.Here are the 15 countries that produce the best engineers in the world:15.

Given what is an attractive valuation can change depending on a stock's specifics, sector fundamentals, and broader economic factors that change all the time, there isn't a single indicator such as forward P/E that tells whether a stock is cheap or not.Instead, the best cheap stocks to buy are arguably blue chip stocks with substantial competitive advantages and also growth potential that are trading for fair or low valuations. Blue chips are established companies with competitive advantages that are well known and generally are pretty profitable. For those of you interested, check out 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Given the recent failure of Silicon Valley Bank and several other banks, the stock prices of many leading blue chip stocks in financial sector have declined. As a result, some leading financial blue chip stocks that are the leaders in their sectors could be trading at attractive valuations in the long term if economic conditions normalize. Financial stocks may have near term downside risk, however, if more banks fail or if the economy slows more than expected.For some companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), the stocks trade for higher forward P/E ratios but are still nevertheless considered cheap given their growth potential due to the growth of AI.Story continuesAccording to Goldman Sachs, generative AI could eventually increase annual global GDP by 7% at some point in the future with productivity increases.If AI continues to improve, AI could potentially increase the production and services significantly further in the long term.As a result of AI's potential, demand for semiconductors which are needed to power AI will likely increase and essential semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) which is at least several years ahead of its competition will likely benefit from the increases in demand. For those of you interested, check out 10 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy.Similarly, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will likely benefit from the growth in AI given it can incorporate AI into much of its software to make it more useful. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) can also benefit from AI given it owns a leading cloud business that can power many AI applications as well. AI like ChatGPT currently still makes mistakes which limits its effectiveness, but the AI is improving and will improve further in the future.Given any sector can change substantially in the future and any single company can fall behind for a variety of reasons, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Real Estate, BuildingPhoto by sean pollock on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 14 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to Buy, we picked 14 stocks with competitive advantages and growth potential that arguably trade for arguably attractive valuations.We ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that owned shares in the same stock at the end of Q4.For those of you interested, check out 13 Best Long Term Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.14 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to Buy14.

That is because the Apr 21, 2023 $140.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Cigna Group shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Cheap Beginner Stocks to Buy.Morgan Stanley's Big Bear: ""It's Just A Much Less Predictable World""On March 27 Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist, Mike Wilson, gave an interview to Bloomberg where he discussed his view of the markets right now. Wilson noted that the bond market is not moving in coherence with the Fed, and he thinks the equities market will follow this trajectory. Here are some comments from Mike Wilson:""It's just a much less predictable world, and this has been our theme for the last couple of years, that we're entering a period of economic volatility. The last 20 years has been a world of repression where all of these metrics were somewhat predictable, and that's for companies, that's for the Fed itself, that's for investors. And now we're entering a world when it's just not as predictable, and that means higher risk premiums. Whether we're talking about credit, whether we're talking about term premium in the bond market, or we're talking about equity risk premium. In our view, I think people are operating as if we're gonna go back to that predictable world and that's, I think, misplaced.""Mike Wilson said that the degradation in multiples that stocks had last year was due to higher interest rates and not higher risk premiums. According to Wilson, the market has started to ""revalue, or devalue, the companies that are most at risk of missing estimates"". The companies that are expected to come under pressure in a high interest rate environment and are most at risk of missing estimates, according to Wilson, include small-cap, lower quality, and cyclical companies.Moreover, Mike Wilson pointed out that tech companies experienced significant declines in their stock prices last year due to their high valuations and sensitivity to rising interest rates. While these companies have cut costs, which has led to them rallying, Wilson believes that there are still risks associated with investing in them especially given the potential for further cost pressures.Story continuesThere are some areas within the market that Mike Wilson thinks have repriced and are presenting an opportunity. The financials segment has ""repriced in a meaningful way"", said Wilson. Moreover, some consumer-focused businesses and the retail segment have also repriced. Mike Wilson thinks there are opportunities in individual stocks, as opposed to indices, which do not look as attractive to him at this point in time.Finally, Mike Wilson thinks that valuations will reset over the next two quarters. However, he also said that he does not think stock valuations will stay low for long, and this is not a ""secular structural bear market"", it is actually a ""cyclical bear market"" and there is enough liquidity to stabilize things.The markets are extremely volatile and uncertain right now, given sticky inflation and a hawkish Fed. In times like these, retail investors can feel overwhelmed when it comes to investing in the stock market. However, looking at where institutional investors are parking cash can be insightful, as they have the resources and expertise to make sensical investment decisions. We have compiled a list of the 15 cheap beginner stocks to buy now according to hedge funds, which include QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).

Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy. For the first three quarters of the year, we should change the name of our fund to the Jed Clampett Fund. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), was one of the standouts.

In particular, shares of Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) were pressured by its recently announced multiyear capex plan to accelerate network upgrades. While this reduces free cash flow available for buybacks in the medium term, it sustains the company’s competitive advantage and should accelerate long term growth. The company also has ambitious goals to expand its footprint into adjacent and rural markets, taking advantage of the federal and state broadband subsidies.

(NASDAQ:MU) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”12. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)PE Ratio (TTM) as of March 28: 10.59Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)11. Biogen Inc.

Cigna Healthcare provides health insurance products, including a business in which Cigna provides administrative services only to plan sponsors (employers, unions, and other groups). Evernorth provides a portfolio of health care services, including pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services, care delivery services, data and analytics solutions, and distribution of specialty drugs. Each segment has a portion of business that provides steady, predictable growth. These foundational businesses, which account for roughly 60% of total revenue, include the U.S. commercial business, the PBM business, and international. The other 40% of revenue comes from higher-growth businesses, including the specialty pharmacy business, care delivery services, and Medicare Advantage. Management targets 10% to 13% annual EPS growth over the long term. The stock trades at a significant discount to industry peers because of the company’s commercial health insurance and PBM business mix. We think the PBM business will benefit from the biosimilar wave in the next few years, and as Cigna’s higher growth businesses become a bigger percentage of the overall mix, we think the stock can appreciate at least in line with its annual EPS growth with potential for valuation expansion.”8.

The work related to this deal will be carried out at multiple locations across the United States and is scheduled to be completed by September 2026.What's Favoring Raytheon Technologies?In recent times, nations have increased their defense spending on military equipment and weaponry to modernize and upgrade defense systems amid rising geopolitical tensions. In such a scenario, radars, which ensure efficient military surveillance and reconnaissance, tend to play an important role in military missions. Backed by such importance in military missions, radars are likely to witness fortified demand in the days ahead.Amid such an increased demand expectation, Raytheon Technologies’ expertise in manufacturing technologically advanced radars may provide an edge to the company for a large inflow of orders. Raytheon has a comprehensive range of radars like APG-79, APG-82, B-52 AESA radars, etc., which allows the company to take advantage of the lucrative radar market.Backed by such efficiency in manufacturing radars and Raytheon’s continuous investment strategy to improve the technology, the company enjoys a solid inflow of contracts, like the latest one involving the production of radars and providing other related support.

A representative for Nike did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The company’s most recently available impact report from fiscal 2021 cites forced labor, supply chain transparency and labor rights as some of its essential priorities.The report states that 85% of facilities in Nike’s extended supply chain met its foundational labor, health, safety and environmental standards and the company now expects suppliers to develop and share internal codes of conduct.Tulipshare, though, said Nike has failed to adequately disclose how it assesses the risk of Uyghur forced labor within its supply chain and cited ongoing labor complaints against the company.A coalition of international garment worker unions and labor rights groups filed a complaint against Nike with the U.S. State Department in February, alleging that Nike violated guidelines from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development by triggering layoffs and pay cuts throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.Story continues“Nike did not engage with garment worker unions representing Nike supply chain workers about those impacts, despite the OECD Guidelines’ expectation that multinational enterprises do so and despite unions’ requests for dialogue,” the complaint states.A representative for Nike did not respond to a request for comment about the allegations. However, the company has previously stated that it does not source products from China’s Xinjiang region, where the Chinese government is reported to have established labor camps for ethnic Uyghur and other Muslim groups.In a fiscal 2022 statement on forced labor, Nike said it is growing its business ""through long-term relationships with suppliers that are committed to our strict standards of sustainability and human rights, product excellence and compliance with local laws.""(Reporting by Katherine Masters; Editing by Leslie Adler)]"

Nike's (NKE) earnings earlier this month were impressive too, in a large part due to sales of pricey Jordan brand sneakers.A pedestrian walks past a Foot Locker store in Spain on April 23, 2022. (Photo by Xavi Lopez/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)Even Foot Locker (FL) CEO Mary Dillon hinted on Yahoo Finance Live this week that consumer demand has remained solid.But not everything in consumer land has been perfect.In fact, several yellow flags — perhaps fueled by March's chaotic economic headlines — have been tossed onto the playing field for investors to consider.RH's (RH) earnings late Wednesday were far from perfect. The company's CEO says consumers are spending less on expensive home furnishings because of weakness in the luxury housing market, inflation, the banking crisis, and higher interest rates.""We absolutely are [seeing a more cautious shopper] when it comes to categories that are discretionary in nature,"" Chewy (CHWY) CEO Sumit Singh told Yahoo Finance Live this week. ""So consumables and health that make up over 80% of our sales remain pillars of strength. Consumers aren't trading down, and they aren't sacrificing their pet's needs.""And new data out of Bank of America on Thursday has led to a few more yellow flags. Here are the three charts you need to know.1. Companies see demand weakness in the first quarterBofA's keyword analysis of earnings calls that took place in the first quarter show that mentions of ""weak demand"" have reached levels not seen since the COVID-19 pandemic, as indicated in the chart below.Story continuesConsumer weakness may be partially to blame.BofA aggregated credit and debit card spending growth year-over-year in furniture and apparel has been negative for the last several months, the firm noted.Companies are calling attention to weakening demand. (Bank of America)2. Promotions at retailers are picking upIn another surefire sign of consumer weakness, retailers are picking up their promotions in order to entice shoppers, BofA's data suggests. The average percentage of merchandise on discount at select U.S. online retailers has risen to levels slightly higher than those seen in 2019 (see chart below).BMO Capital Markets retail analyst Simeon Siegel told Yahoo Finance Live this week (video above) he expects a more promotional spring selling season. ""I think if you're a consumer, expect deals,"" he said.The deals are starting to appear at retailers ahead of the spring shopping season. (Bank of America)3. The pre-spring inventory glutWith BofA data showing a more cautious pace of spending for discretionary items, it's logical that inventories appear bloated for many companies right now.BofA's analysis of U.S. earnings calls in the first quarter found that mentions of ""excess inventory"" and ""inventory de-stocking"" are at five-plus year highs. Shippers are also seeing overstocked inventory, BofA's research found.Case in point is the aforementioned RH.The company's fourth-quarter sales plunged 14.4% year over year to $772.5 million. At the same time, inventory ballooned about $70 million from a year ago as sales tanked.Looking at inventory levels, it would appear many companies saw missed sales targets in the first quarter.

Year-to-date, the index is down 1.67% and returned 11.49% in the past six months, as of March 29. Some important Dow companies include Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).The companies that make up the DJIA are leaders in their respective industries and are considered to be representative of the overall performance of the U.S. stock market. The DJIA is often used as a benchmark for the performance of the U.S. stock market as a whole, and investors and analysts use it to track the performance of individual companies and to make investment decisions. The index has shown strong performance over the past years relative to its counterpart, the S&amp;P 500. According to a report by Forbes, the index delivered an average annual return of 16.65% in three years that ended in 2019, compared with a 14.03% annualized return on the S&amp;P 500. In our previous article, we shed light on the performance of both indexes and reported that the Dow has outperformed the wider market over the last 30 years that ended June 2021. During this period, the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 10.6% return, compared with an 11.16% return of the DJIA.In the current market situation, dividend stocks are gaining a lot of traction among investors as they try to generate stable and regular income. When it comes to dividend investing, companies that have proven dividend growth track records become popular because of their strong cash flow generation and solid balance sheets. Dividend growers also dominate the market, especially during periods of high turbulence. A report by Capital Group revealed the importance of dividend stocks and mentioned that they accounted for nearly one-third of the market’s total return from 1926 to 2021. The report also mentioned that dividend growers returned 9.3% to shareholders from 1990 to 2022, with a 14.5% volatility. In comparison, non-dividend payers delivered a 4% return during the same period, with a volatility of 19.7%.

However, for this list, we selected companies from the index that are popular among elite funds. We analyzed Insider Monkey's database of Q4 2022 for measuring hedge fund sentiment around each stock.Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds11. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is an Oregon-based multinational footwear manufacturing company that also manufactures apparel, equipment, and other related accessories. In fiscal Q3 2022, the company posted revenue of $12.4 billion, which showed a 14% growth from the same period last year. During the quarter, the company paid $528 million to shareholders in dividends, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are some other popular dividend stocks in DJIA.Following the company's recent quarterly earnings, Morgan Stanley maintained an Overweight rating on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in March with a $130 price target.NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share, having raised it by 12% in November 2022. Through this increase, the company took its dividend growth streak to 21 years. The stock has a dividend yield of 1.15%, as of March 29.At the end of Q4 2022, 71 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), up from 70 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $4 billion.RiverPark Advisors mentioned NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares were a top contributor for 4Q as the company reported solid 2Q23 results and raised its annual guidance. Nike reported 17% revenue growth (27% on a currency neutral basis) and $0.85 EPS, both significantly greater than expectations. Management raised its F23 outlook to low teens currency-neutral revenue growth.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect gross and operating margin improvements as it shifts its product mix to more premium products and adopts a more direct to consumer approach, driving long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”10. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an American financial services company that specializes in payment cards. The company raised its quarterly dividend by 15% on March 9 to $0.60 per share. It has been making regular dividend payments to shareholders for the past 30 years.

The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74An American multinational consumer goods corporation, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks. JPMorgan upgraded the stock to Overweight in March and also raised its price target on the stock to $155.

Among these hedge funds, Bridgewater Associates was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q4.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”8. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

(NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)7.

Shares have benefited from investors seeking safety in areas with less economic and interest rate sensitivity. With about one third of its sales generated by blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, the key issue for investors is the success of its large R&amp;D pipeline to replace those sales when Keytruda comes off patent in 2028. However, Merck seems to be getting little credit from investors for the 60+ programs it has in clinical development, despite having several solid and large new product opportunities.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.The consumer discretionary sector took a hit last year as shoppers tend to cut back on discretionary spending when they feel the heat of inflation. As the Federal Reserve launched its rate hike onslaught to tame inflation, consumers started to tighten their belts. As of the end of 2022, the consumer discretionary subindex was down a whopping 37%, compared to a 19% decline of the S&amp;P 500 index. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 consumer staples subindex was down just by 2.7% in the period.However, the consumer discretionary sector started to post a comeback this year as the market saw a strange optimism. As of February 7, consumer discretionary was one of the top-performing sectors of the S&amp;P 500 in 2023.While the Federal Reserve has indicated its plan to keep raising interest rates in 2023 amid rising inflation and a strong labor market, some believe consumer spending will remain strong. Retail spending in January jumped 3% from December on a seasonally adjusted basis. This spending growth was surprisingly boosted by vehicles, furniture, clothing and dining out. According to a Wall Street Journal report, Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, believes consumer spending will remain strong as long as labor market, wage growth and savings rates hold up.While consumer discretionary sector is sensitive to interest rate hikes, the industry is full of companies that are paying attractive dividends. These companies are expected to benefit in the long term when the market begins to recover. That’s why investing in consumer discretionary dividend stocks which have strong yields and dividend safety is a decent bet for long-term investors.Best Consumer Discretionary Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/Story continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their stock holdings as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 and picked 15 consumer discretionary dividend stocks that had the highest number of hedge fund investors.

(NYSE:AAP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also found an opportunity to add to our existing position in Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) as the stock fell and the risk/reward profile improved. Advance underperformed early in the quarter as lower-quality sector peers bounced significantly. In August, shares fell further after the company reported second quarter earnings that disappointed because of weakerthan-expected same-store sales. Furthermore, management reduced its full-year earnings outlook by ~4%, citing softening consumer purchasing patterns within AAP’s “do-it-yourself” business.The most important driver of Advance Auto’s earnings power seems to be the management team’s ability to improve margin expansion. However, the market remains myopically focused on sales growth. The margin expansion opportunity originates from the consolidation of an overly complex and inefficient distribution network. Management is planning to roll out new distribution center. software through 2023 that will reduce costs, improve network productivity, and enhance customer experience through better inventory availability.In addition, the auto parts retailing industry tends to be less cyclical than the Consumer Discretionary sector because consumers often hold onto their used cars longer and make necessary repairs rather than buy new vehicles when their financial prospects are weakened. AAP is currently trading at less than 12 times forward earnings, well below the company’s long-term median P/E of more than 15—while having significant room to improve profitability owing to its self-help initiatives.”7.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January.

After all, successful scoring, rebounding, and defending require practice, diligence, and a good game plan.Finances after college, the student-athletes learned at a financial literacy breakfast on Feb. 21, aren't that dissimilar. The breakfast was sponsored by Wells Fargo - the official banking partner of the CIAA - with curriculum presented by Our Money Matters, or OMM. successful scoring, rebounding, and defending require practice, diligence, and a good game plan.The Wells Fargo Foundation is the exclusive funder of Our Money Matters, launched in collaboration with HBCU Community Development Action Coalition to equip college students of color with the financial knowledge, tools, access, and opportunities to close the racial wealth gap.""Income disparities and racial discrimination affect the wealth gap that students of color experience during and after college. Financial literacy can help students decrease this gap, increase financial stability, and enable wealth building,"" said Bonnie Wallace, head of Financial Health Philanthropy at Wells Fargo.More than 200 men's and women's basketball players attended the breakfast before the start of the 2023 CIAA Tournament - one of the most prestigious sporting events among historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs.""Financial literacy is something I'm just beginning to fully understand,"" said Raemaad Wright, a starting forward on Virginia Union University men's team. ""I think this breakfast was really important because it'll help me better prepare myself financially to create generational wealth.""LaRese Purnell, an author, brand ambassador for OMM, and co-owner and managing partner of CLE Consulting Firm, shared financial health tips and tricks with the student-athletes.Story continuesBelow are four tips he shared with the players that can also help you win in the game of financial health.1. Share the ballNo one wants to play on a team where one person takes all the shots and gets all the glory. That's why Purnell shared one of the crown jewels of OMM - the 50/20/30 rule.Its goal is to make people think about the distribution of their money. From every $1, 50 cents should go toward basic needs, 30 cents to investments (saving), and 20 cents to wants.""We have so many people come to us at an older age and say they can't apply this rule because of kids and mortgages and other things,"" said Purnell. ""But these players are at the perfect age to set this standard, so they can apply it before all the big things come in life.""2. Know the scoreAccording to the Urban Institute, young adults in majority-Black communities have a median credit score of 582, those in majority-Hispanic communities a 644, and those in majority-white communities a 687.People with credit scores below 600 often find it more difficult and expensive to secure mortgages, business and car loans, and other types of credit.That's why Purnell rallied for participants to shout ""800!"" during the OMM session at the CIAA tournament.""One way to lessen the racial wealth gap is to level the playing field,"" he explained. ""If we can get them, at this age, to understand credit and boost them to an 800 score, that's potentially life-changing. They can get credit for those big purchases later in life, and not be held down by poor choices in years past.""A credit score at 800 and above is appealing to lenders and often provides mortgage, auto, and personal loans with better terms.No one wants to play on a team where one person takes all the shots and gets all the glory. That's why Purnell shared one of the crown jewels of OMM - the 50/20/30 rule.Its goal is to make people think about the distribution of their money. From every $1, 50 cents should go toward basic needs, 30 cents to investments (saving), and 20 cents to wants.""We have so many people come to us at an older age and say they can't apply this rule because of kids and mortgages and other things,"" said Purnell. ""But these players are at the perfect age to set this standard, so they can apply it before all the big things come in life.""3. Take good shotsIn finances, there typically aren't quick-fix solutions. Saving, investing, paying down debt, and improving your credit score take time and focus.It can be easy to take your eyes off the ball, make an extravagant purchase or take an expensive trip, and wash away the hard work of raising your credit score.Our wants make goal setting vital to financial health, Purnell told the student-athletes. Whether it's saving $10 per check or reducing the number of times you eat out each month, Purnell urges people to have a goal.Imani Elliot, a point guard on the Fayetteville State University women's team, said the session was helpful as she begins to transition away from basketball and into full-time work.""What you do now is going to affect you down the line,"" she said. ""So, if I can start now, then later (in life), that's when I'm going to see the benefit. (My) short-term goal is to buy a new car.""In finances, there typically aren't quick-fix solutions.

Follow the game planFinancial planning apps and guidance are only a click away for those who wish to use them. OMM offers free online resources - adaptive learning technology and a library of videos and articles - that help individuals get on the path to financial wellness and enable them to meet specific goals.""We had our team members walking the floor so the student-athletes could download OMM's resources during the presentation,"" said Purnell. ""It was exciting to see them engaged and to see that we had 100% participation.""CIAA Commissioner Jacqie McWilliams also attended the session.""The importance of financial literacy for our student-athletes can't be overstated,"" McWilliams said. ""Many of our players will soon leave our campuses and, for the first time, be tasked with understanding how to prioritize, how to spend their money, how to invest, and how to save. It's my hope that, with the help of organizations like Our Money Matters and Wells Fargo, our student-athletes see financial health as an opportunity to build long-term, sustainable economic wealth for themselves and their communities.""Wells Fargo, Friday, March 31, 2023, Press release pictureEach February, the CIAA Tournament showcases HBCU men's and women's basketball for thousands of fans across the country.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Wells Fargo on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Wells FargoWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/wells-fargoEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Wells FargoView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/746949/Four-Plays-for-Improving-Your-Financial-Health]"

These grants, made possible by the Wells Fargo Foundation and Citi Foundation, were disbursed through the Living Cities Closing the Gaps Network, a multi-year initiative bringing together leaders from cities across the country who are committed to building an anti-racist society that advances equitable and inclusive economic opportunity.""Homeownership and small business ownership are two of the proven ways to help any group of individuals build wealth to support themselves and their families,"" said Joe Scantlebury, President and CEO of Living Cities. ""Gaps in wealth between people of color and white people persist and it will take coordinated, direct action by leaders in cities to turn back the on-going legacy of systemic racism. We believe that removing barriers to Black, Indigenous, and other people of color owning homes and small businesses is key for our nation's future.""The $3.2 million will be distributed across six cities focused on the following strategies:Albuquerque, NM: Develop city-owned land to support and increase the homeownership rates for local Native and Black communities, as well as offer technical assistance to develop a pipeline of licensed Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) general contractors in the city.Austin, TX: Partner with UpTogether to launch a direct cash assistance to support Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) who want to purchase homes through the City of Austin's land trust, as well as partner with community based organizations to provide equity infusions and technical support for BIPOC entrepreneurs.Memphis, TN: Create a community land trust in the historic Orange Mound neighborhood to provide affordable homeownership, as well as develop a Contractors University to improve BIPOC access to contextual technical assistance, strengthen the contractor community, and help more BIPOC businesses contract with the city.Minneapolis, MN: Partner with Youthprise to create a pilot cohort of underserved BIPOC youth to support them in advancing cooperative models for business and home ownership.Saint Paul, MN: Contribute to the- Inheritance Fund, which offers forgivable loans to help low-income descendants of the old Rondo neighborhood purchase homes and support homeownership and employee owned co-ops through capacity building.Rochester, NY: Target outreach to Head Start families with Housing Choice Vouchers to buy homes using their vouchers and assist with down payment assistance, as well as offering grants to early-stage BIPOC owned businesses, navigation support, and other technical assistance.Story continues""We facilitate wealth building by making direct investments in the workers and families who call Saint Paul home,"" said Mayor Carter.

Evans. ""We understand that we have made progress, but it will take more work to dismantle decades of institutionalized racism. The City of Rochester is committed to using these funds to bridge the racial wealth gap by administering government policies and programs to increase homeownership and entrepreneurship opportunities for those who've been historically marginalized and underserved.""""We are doing more than ever before to ensure Black and Native residents have the resources and opportunities to become homeowners. Homeownership is a key pathway to creating generational wealth. Expanding housing options can change the lives of prospective homeowners while creating opportunities for Black and Native developers and contractors. Addressing the needs and potential of these communities builds a better and more equitable Albuquerque,"" said Mayor Tim Keller. ""We are grateful that Living Cities is supporting these wealth-building efforts.""""Restoring financial well-being has to start at the local level where historically marginalized people can access pathways to home and small business ownership,"" said Otis Rolley, president of the Wells Fargo Foundation. ""We're excited to see how each of the selected cities customizes solutions for the needs of their community as they work to close the racial wealth gap. At Wells Fargo, we are committed to strengthening underserved communities and opening up more ways for people to grow generational wealth.""""Tackling the racial wealth gap requires a commitment to systemic interventions and bringing diverse change-makers to the table. That's exactly what Living Cities is doing through its Closing the Gaps Network,"" said Brandee McHale, President of the Citi Foundation and Head of Community Investing and Development at Citi. ""By supporting this initiative, the Citi Foundation aims to help more U.S. cities test new approaches that have the potential to catalyze meaningful progress toward wealth creation and equitable growth.""About Living Cities Living Cities harnesses the collective power of philanthropy, financial institutions, and local governments to close racial income and wealth gaps in U.S. cities.

To see more such companies, go directly to Starter Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Stocks To Buy.Amid the current market turmoil which seems to have no end in sight, it feels weird to label anything as “safe,” especially stocks, which are spooking investors more and more, forcing them to pull money from the stock market and invest in other investment vehicles. A Wall Street Journal report earlier this month quoted  a survey from Bank of America, which said that fund managers’ allocation of stocks is now at about 2.2 standard deviations below its long-term average. The report said that instead of stocks, fund managers are gaining more exposure to bonds, emerging markets, cash and commodities.However, for those who are still interested in investing in the stock market, there’s almost a consensus among analysts that short-term market cycles should not blur your long-term outlook.""Don't Fear the Bear""According to an Edward Jones report titled “Don’t Fear The Bear,” from 1900 through 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) has had an average annual return of 9.9%, including dividends. The report said that investors should invest in quality stocks and should not worry about the short-term bear markets.“Instead of worrying about the timing of the next bear market, prepare your portfolio today with an appropriate mix of quality investments so you can stay invested in both bear and bull markets over time”When it comes to investment options for beginners, ETFs have gained a lot of popularity over the past few years, thanks to the wider exposure they provide to a basket of stocks with limited risks. One of the biggest benefits of investing in ETFs is that they give you exposure to a wide range of stocks in budget. Investing in ETFs also saves you a lot of money in transaction fees that comes with trading individual stocks. When you are investing ETFs, your transactions fees is limited when compared to stocks and mutual funds.Story continuesThe Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF is one of the most recommended ETFs for beginner investors since the ETF is composed of low-risk, high-quality stocks that are considered the safest. For this article, we scanned the top holdings of the ETF and picked 15 stocks that are considered the safest for beginner investors. We started from the top of the ETF’s holdings and picked stocks that are dominating their industries and have strong dividend histories. Given the current banking crisis and the volatility in the financial sector, we skipped banks and financial services stocks.The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors for each stock, which we took from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.Starter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To BuyPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To Buy15. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57With over 35 years of consistent dividend increases and a dividend yield of over 3.5%, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is one of the best and safest stocks to buy for beginners. Recently, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar increased the price target of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock to $206 from $200 and kept a Buy rating.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 57 hedge funds out of the 943 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). The total value of these stakes was $32 billion. A whopping $29 billion of these $32 billion stakes was owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.Carillon Eagle Growth &amp; Income Fund made the following comment about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)  in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Energy performed well during the fourth quarter, with the sector up about 23%. Investors returned to the sector after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) signaled it would reduce production. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) reported strong quarterly results while buying back stock, paying a healthy dividend, and maintaining a strong balance sheet.”14. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the best defensive stock picks for a recessionary environment according to several analysts. Last month, Citi started covering The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) with a Buy rating and a $68 price target. During the same month, Morgan Stanley kept an Overweight rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) but raised its price target to $70.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 58 hedge funds had stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) according to Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds. The biggest stakeholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  (NYSE:BRK-B) which had a $25 billion stake.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”13. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62With years of consistent dividend increases and a solid underlying business, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is one of the best picks for any starter stock portfolio.Recently, UBS ran a machine-learning model to select its top dividend picks. Unsurprisingly, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) made it to the list of these dividend stocks.The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) recently posted weak Q4 results. But several Wall Street analysts kept their optimistic view of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD). For example, BofA’s Elizabeth Suzuki said that The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)’s 2023 guidance may be overly conservative.The analyst expects home investment to remain above pre-COVID levels as she believes the “tailwinds for the home improvement industry are generally favorable.”Matrix Asset Advisors made the following comment about The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“During the quarter, we re-established a position in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) sold earlier this year, after the shares declined sharply on big picture concerns about a softer housing market and lower consumer spending. We believe that HD is a very well-managed company, positioned to continue showing good profits even as the economy decelerates. The products it carries in inventory are in year-round demand from contractors and homeowners wanting to maintain and improve their homes. The company has historically been shareholder friendly, repurchasing shares and increasing the dividend, most recently by 15% earlier this year. On September 30, HD’s current dividend yield was 2.8%.”12. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the stocks that remain stable even during recessions and high inflation. Recently, Bank of America said that food inflation could provide an upside potential to several grocery stocks and warehouse clubs like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST).At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 66 hedge funds had stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). The total value of these stakes was $3.4 billion.Madison Funds made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has raised its dividends consecutively for 50 years. The biggest retailer in the US has a stable business and long-term growth catalysts. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was among the “sleep at night” stocks picked up by BofA’s dividend growers screen recently.10. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73With several drugs in the pipeline and a solid dividend history, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is one of the best stock picks for starters. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a member of the S&amp;P Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks companies that have annually increased their dividend for at least 25 consecutive years.Earlier this year, Guggenheim started covering AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) with a Buy rating and a $172 price target.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 73 hedge funds had stakes in AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), according to Insider Monkey’s proprietary database. The total value of these hedge funds’ stakes was $1.5 billion. The biggest stakeholder of AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) was Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management which had a $229 million stake in the company.Alger Capital made the following comment about AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a global biopharmaceutical company that develops and markets drugs in areas such as immunology. virology and oncology. Recently, the company expanded through the acquisition of Allergan, which added robust growth assets to help offset the loss of U.S. patent protection for Humira, a leading treatment used for rheumatology, dermatology. gastroenterology, and ophthalmology. While AbbVie reported weak third quarter revenues across the board, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vraylar (an antipsychotic treatment) in December. Despite concerns around Humira’s loss of patent protection, we believe AbbVie has significantly diversified its revenue and that its launch of Rinvog for psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis could be promising.”9. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been upping its dividends for 66 years without a break. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) ranks 9th in our list of the safest stocks for starter stock portfolios.Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank selected The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as one of its top picks in the consumer packaged goods category.Another bullish call for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) recently came from JPMorgan, where analyst Andrea Teixeria upgraded the company shares to Overweight from Neutral.Out of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 74 hedge funds had stakes in The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). The biggest stakeholder of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates which had a $757 million stake in the company.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75What makes Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) an ideal pick for beginner investors looking for safe stocks is the company’s presence in several important healthcare sectors and a diversified business. Recently, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) said it will buy Seagen, an oncology-focused biotech company, for $43 billion.Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has a huge pipeline. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is making treatments for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular diseases in addition to making vaccines. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is also working on treatments for rare diseases like hemophilia, Huntington's disease, and sickle cell anemia.Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”7. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Pharma giant Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) ranks 7th in our list of the best starter stock portfolio picks. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has increased its dividend for over a decade now.Recently, Berenberg analyst Luisa Hector increased Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)’s price target to $130 from $125 and kept a Buy rating. The analyst believes Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has room to run after ""significant de-risking"" of the company's cardiovascular pipeline.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 77 hedge funds had stakes in Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), according to Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds.Artisan Value Fund made the following comment about Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a provider of health care solutions including prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, animal health and consumer care products. Shares have benefited from investors seeking safety in areas with less economic and interest rate sensitivity. With about one third of its sales generated by blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, the key issue for investors is the success of its large R&amp;D pipeline to replace those sales when Keytruda comes off patent in 2028. However, Merck seems to be getting little credit from investors for the 60+ programs it has in clinical development, despite having several solid and large new product opportunities. Additionally, the company’s strong balance sheet and robust free cash flow provide it multiple options for future partnerships and acquisitions, besides return of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.”6. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 79While Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) shares have seen a lot of see-saw movements this year, it remains one of the safest stocks for starters for several reasons. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is a solid dividend payer, and it is expected to continue seeing huge demand for oil in the years to come. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is also investing heavily in the clean energy sector to diversify its operations for the future.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Cheap Beginner Stocks to Buy.Morgan Stanley's Big Bear: ""It's Just A Much Less Predictable World""On March 27 Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist, Mike Wilson, gave an interview to Bloomberg where he discussed his view of the markets right now. Wilson noted that the bond market is not moving in coherence with the Fed, and he thinks the equities market will follow this trajectory. Here are some comments from Mike Wilson:""It's just a much less predictable world, and this has been our theme for the last couple of years, that we're entering a period of economic volatility. The last 20 years has been a world of repression where all of these metrics were somewhat predictable, and that's for companies, that's for the Fed itself, that's for investors. And now we're entering a world when it's just not as predictable, and that means higher risk premiums. Whether we're talking about credit, whether we're talking about term premium in the bond market, or we're talking about equity risk premium. In our view, I think people are operating as if we're gonna go back to that predictable world and that's, I think, misplaced.""Mike Wilson said that the degradation in multiples that stocks had last year was due to higher interest rates and not higher risk premiums. According to Wilson, the market has started to ""revalue, or devalue, the companies that are most at risk of missing estimates"". The companies that are expected to come under pressure in a high interest rate environment and are most at risk of missing estimates, according to Wilson, include small-cap, lower quality, and cyclical companies.Moreover, Mike Wilson pointed out that tech companies experienced significant declines in their stock prices last year due to their high valuations and sensitivity to rising interest rates. While these companies have cut costs, which has led to them rallying, Wilson believes that there are still risks associated with investing in them especially given the potential for further cost pressures.Story continuesThere are some areas within the market that Mike Wilson thinks have repriced and are presenting an opportunity. The financials segment has ""repriced in a meaningful way"", said Wilson. Moreover, some consumer-focused businesses and the retail segment have also repriced. Mike Wilson thinks there are opportunities in individual stocks, as opposed to indices, which do not look as attractive to him at this point in time.Finally, Mike Wilson thinks that valuations will reset over the next two quarters. However, he also said that he does not think stock valuations will stay low for long, and this is not a ""secular structural bear market"", it is actually a ""cyclical bear market"" and there is enough liquidity to stabilize things.The markets are extremely volatile and uncertain right now, given sticky inflation and a hawkish Fed. In times like these, retail investors can feel overwhelmed when it comes to investing in the stock market. However, looking at where institutional investors are parking cash can be insightful, as they have the resources and expertise to make sensical investment decisions. We have compiled a list of the 15 cheap beginner stocks to buy now according to hedge funds, which include QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).

Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy. For the first three quarters of the year, we should change the name of our fund to the Jed Clampett Fund. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), was one of the standouts. Up through the bear market came a “bubblin’ crude!”14. Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR)PE Ratio (TTM) as of March 28: 11.18 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Charter Communications, Inc.

In particular, shares of Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) were pressured by its recently announced multiyear capex plan to accelerate network upgrades. While this reduces free cash flow available for buybacks in the medium term, it sustains the company’s competitive advantage and should accelerate long term growth. The company also has ambitious goals to expand its footprint into adjacent and rural markets, taking advantage of the federal and state broadband subsidies. We added opportunistically to Charter on the pullback.”Other cheap stocks that are on hedge funds' radars right now include QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).13.

Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”12. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)11. Biogen Inc.

Cigna Healthcare provides health insurance products, including a business in which Cigna provides administrative services only to plan sponsors (employers, unions, and other groups). Evernorth provides a portfolio of health care services, including pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services, care delivery services, data and analytics solutions, and distribution of specialty drugs. Each segment has a portion of business that provides steady, predictable growth. These foundational businesses, which account for roughly 60% of total revenue, include the U.S. commercial business, the PBM business, and international. The other 40% of revenue comes from higher-growth businesses, including the specialty pharmacy business, care delivery services, and Medicare Advantage. Management targets 10% to 13% annual EPS growth over the long term. The stock trades at a significant discount to industry peers because of the company’s commercial health insurance and PBM business mix. We think the PBM business will benefit from the biosimilar wave in the next few years, and as Cigna’s higher growth businesses become a bigger percentage of the overall mix, we think the stock can appreciate at least in line with its annual EPS growth with potential for valuation expansion.”8.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Promising Healthcare Stocks According to Analysts.2023 is turning out to be a horrific year for financial markets as investors are starting to see a glimpse of a possible economic collapse last seen during the 2008 financial crisis. Amid the Silicon Valley Bank debacle, several analysts and investors, including the Big Short Michael Burry, are warning that things could worsen in the coming weeks and months. In this backdrop, it’s but natural for investors to look for safe sectors to park their cash. The healthcare sector has been famous for being defensive and relatively safe during recessions.Should You Buy Healthcare Stocks Before The Next Recession?According to a report published by Sevens Report, the healthcare sector was one of the best performers over the past three recessions.  Why is the healthcare sector defensive and safe? The reason is simple. The healthcare industry spans products and services that are often deemed essential in nature.A report from Fidelity explains:“As investors begin to glimpse signs of an economic slowdown, defensive-oriented sectors—those in which revenues are tied more to basic needs and are less economically sensitive—generally have performed well. These include health care, consumer staples, and utilities.”At another point, the report explains why the healthcare sector, in addition to some other defensive sectors, remains strong in the face of a recession:“These less economically sensitive sectors, including consumer staples, utilities, and health care, are dominated by industries that produce items such as toothpaste, electricity, and prescription drugs, which consumers are less likely to cut back on during a recession.”M&amp;A Activity in the Healthcare IndustryWhile the SVB collapse is haunting the tech industry, where several startups have their money linked to the fallen bank, the healthcare industry seems safe and has been making headlines with some mega deals lately. Several of the industry giants, including Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Merck &amp; Co Inc (NYSE:MRK). AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV) and Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), had already indicated earlier this year that they are interested in buying new companies this year. Analysts believe healthcare companies are interested in new deals in a bid to update their aging pipelines and fight market saturation.Story continuesPerhaps the biggest deal of 2023 to date came when Pfizer announced to acquire cancer drug company Seagen for a whopping $43 billion.Sanofi has also announced to buy Provention Bio Inc., for $2.9 billion. Provention is known for its diabetes treatment.Most Promising Healthcare Stocks According to AnalystsVILevi/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor this article we first used the Finviz stock screener to list healthcare stocks whose average analyst price target is 50% more than their current levels.

The company reported revenues that were better than expected, though earnings were lower. There was an acceleration of sales for Caplyta, a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar depression. However, some investors appeared concerned that as Caplyta volumes increased to a higher level that the rate of growth will slow. We view the projected growth trajectory positively, as well as Caplyta’s potential for use in other indications, so we added to our position.”9.

Over the past year, we trimmed our position significantly as we believed the stock’s valuation failed to reflect the windfall nature of COVID-19 vaccine cash flows. With the stock nearly 70% off its highs and, more importantly, at a reasonable discount to our PMV estimate, we view the valuation as opportunistic given its long-term profit cycle potential. BioNTech’s intellectual property in mRNA, and COVID funded manufacturing capacity leave it well-positioned to develop new mRNA vaccines and cancer therapies. In addition, the company has non-mRNA technology (e.g., cell therapy assets) and blue-chip partnerships offering additional optionality. While the company’s R&amp;D pipeline beyond COVID-19 vaccines will take some time to mature, it is well funded by close to $20 billion in COVID-vaccine proceeds. We increased our position within the GardenSM as the stock declined.”6. Karuna Therapeutics, Inc.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Marathon Petroleum (MPC).Marathon Petroleum currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.47, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.47 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 73.3% and 6.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MPCBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MPCCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Marathon Petroleum here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Marathon Petroleum, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is MPC Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Marathon Petroleum, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 14.1% over the past month to $20.31.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Marathon Petroleum. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Marathon Petroleum may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

She would hang her bullet-proof vest on the shower door, reach over the toilet to get to her locker, and use the toilet as a seat to put on her boots.""The station was built long before women were commonplace in police work, so the building itself was not designed with double locker rooms for men and women,"" said Corporal Winward. ""No one could possibly have been able to anticipate the need for women's facilities five decades ago.""Police Chief Dan Jones recognized the small women's restroom was not sufficient for the three female officers on staff, but the city did not have the funding to renovate the area. He believed it was going to limit their ability to recruit and retain women officers on the force in the future.Whitney Walton, Security Coordinator at the Marathon Petroleum Detroit refinery, met with Chief Jones to discuss how Marathon could help recruit and retain officers. Melvindale is located 10 miles southwest of Detroit and home to a tank farm used by the Detroit refinery. Walton, a member of the Detroit refinery's women's employee network chapter, secured a grant from the refinery to upgrade the women's locker room. Representatives from the women's employee network met with the officers to get their feedback on the renovation plans.Story continues""It was great having women from two traditionally male-dominated fields sit down and discuss how to make the space more equitable and inclusive,"" said Walton. ""You can see from the photos that the space turned out amazing.""Construction crews created a new locker room down the hall from the original women's restroom, which is also used by office staff. The new space includes five large lockers, a new vanity, adjustable lighting and a full-length mirror near the lockers for the officers to ensure their appearance falls within department standards. The existing restroom remained in place, meaning that the new locker room will not be shared with civilian staff or guests at the station, which enhances security.""A space like this shows new officers that their needs are considered, and that there is a willingness to meet those needs,"" said Corporal Winward. ""In this case, our needs were not only met, but far exceeded. I think any potential new officer touring the station would be impressed, not only with the physical appearance and conveniences, but also with the fact that the effort expended proves that we are heard and that we are valued.""Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Wednesday, March 29, 2023, Press release pictureCaption: Marathon Petroleum employees Whitney Walton and Operations Excellence Specialist Heather Kight met with Corporal Jessica Winward and Corporal Crystal Dominguez (not pictured) at the Melvindale Police Department to discuss plans for the locker room renovation.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Marathon Petroleum Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Marathon Petroleum CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/marathon-petroleum-corporation Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Marathon Petroleum CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/746593/Before-and-After-Locker-Room-Renovation-Improves-Morale-for-Police-Officers]"

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.57% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.43%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.33%.Heading into today, shares of the company had lost 7.8% over the past month, lagging the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's loss of 4.07% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.72% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from General Motors Company as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, General Motors Company is projected to report earnings of $1.53 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 26.79%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $38.54 billion, up 7.11% from the prior-year quarter.GM's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $6.21 per share and revenue of $161.69 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -18.18% and +3.16%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for General Motors Company. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices.

Please refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more information. I will now turn the discussion over to Lawrence.Lawrence Kurzius: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We are pleased with the start of the year. We delivered solid first quarter results that reflect strong demand and early results from our actions to increase our profit realization in 2023. Our sales performance reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio and the effective execution of our strategies. Our global operating effectiveness, or GOE program, is yielding results with first quarter cost savings in line with our expectations. The progress we are making on gross margin improvement reflects the level of urgency with which we are addressing the pressure points from last year. These results, combined with the strong demand we continue to expect across our portfolio and our diligent approach to optimizing our cost structure, bolster our confidence in our plan and our 2023 full year outlook.Story continuesTurning to Slide 5. In the first quarter, we drove 3% sales growth or 5% in constant currency. Our constant currency sales growth reflected strong underlying business performance with an 11% contribution from pricing, partially offset by a 3% decline in underlying volume and product mix, a planned 1% decline from in basics divestiture and the exit of our consumer business in Russia, and an expected 1% year-over-year volume decline from lower consumption due to COVID-related disruption in China, which we expect to see a return towards normal consumption trends in the coming quarters. Our underlying first quarter sales performance positions us well for continued top line growth for the balance of the year. Our growth in the first quarter was led by outstanding performance in our Flavor Solutions segment with positive momentum continuing in all three regions.In our Consumer segment, our underlying sales growth was led by the Americas region. Moving to profit. Our adjusted operating income was comparable to the first quarter of last year and in constant currency increased 2%. Higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate more than offset our adjusted operating income growth in the quarter, resulting in a 6% decline in adjusted earnings per share. I'd like to say a few words about our gross margin performance, which Mike will cover in more detail in his discussion of our adjusted operating income growth drivers in a few moments. We drove considerable improvement in our gross margin performance in the first quarter. Our gross margin reflects the continued recovery of the cost inflation or pricing lagged over the last two years as well as cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs.As we've said previously, in 2023, we plan to fully recover the inflation our pricing previously lagged as well as offset current year inflation through our pricing actions and other levers. Our gross margin also reflects the result of our diligence in optimizing our cost through our GOE program. This is progressing as planned and remains a key focus. We expect the impact of our GOE program to scale up as the year progresses, and we remain on track to realize $75 million of cost savings in 2023, which we will take to the bottom line because of our actions to normalize our supply chain costs and to streamline our organization. We remain confident that we have the right plans in place and are taking the right actions. It's still early, but our first quarter results speak for themselves, and we expect to continue driving profitable growth at an accelerated rate for the balance of the year.Demand is strong. We're driving improvement in our margin profile and optimizing our cost structure effectively. Now let's move to first quarter business updates for each of our segments as well as discussion of our growth plans. Turning to our Consumer segment on Slide 6. Our underlying performance was strong, reflecting the effective execution of our pricing actions and continuing positive momentum in our consumption trend, even with lapping the elevated at-home consumption in the first quarter of 2022 due to Omicron in the Americas and the EMEA regions. That performance was partially offset by the impacts related to the sale of Kitchen Basics, our exit of Russia and the COVID-related disruption in China. Beginning in the second quarter, the activation of exciting growth initiatives, as well as lapping the impact of last year's COVID-related shutdowns in China and the exit of our consumer business in Russia, which we began to exit in the second quarter of last year, is expected to drive an acceleration of our consumer segment growth.Now for some highlights by region, starting with the Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 5% in line with our shipments. As we anticipated, the dynamics between consumption and retail inventory levels have begun to normalize as we move beyond the holiday season impact, and we anticipate greater alignment between consumption and shipments going forward. Importantly, our volume performance in the first quarter was better than the fourth quarter on higher price realization. In spices and seasonings, both consumption dollars and units accelerated sequentially from the last several quarters, with strength in our seasoning blends, which provide consumers both convenience and flavor exploration.Early results of our Lawry's everyday spice range, our largest innovation launch sense pre-pandemic, continue to be positive. We are seeing incremental sales and profit to the category. Over half of the purchases are from new virus to McCormick and overall incremental to the category. Hot sauce remains on fire with double-digit growth of both Cholula and Frank's RedHot in the U.S. and Canada. We continue to build excitement with our hot sauce brand marketing initiatives and reached the younger generation, most recently through gaming. And our big game campaign during the quarter, our flavor pack version of Fortnite, the Floor is Flavor, had players navigating an immersive chicken wing shaped island and a volcano that's put Frank's RedHot and included in partnership with TGI Fridays and DoorDash, a free chicken wings offer.This was our best big game campaign, capturing over 1 billion impressions in North America. And with the resolution of the long-running shortage of French's mustard bottles, we drove over 20% consumption growth for the second consecutive quarter. Our creamy muster launch last year continues to perform very well, with another flavor launch coming this year. Finally, in the Americas, we continue to drive double-digit consumption growth in e-commerce, led by spices and seasonings, but we're realizing high returns on our investments, gaining new customers and growing with new products. For instance, McCormick Corn seasonings and Frank's variety packs are both off to a great start following their online introductions earlier this year. In EMEA, we continue to have solid share performance of herbs, spices and seasonings in the U.K., Eastern Europe and Italy, somewhat offset by softer performance in France.We're continuing to gain share on Frank's RedHot in the U.K. are building momentum with Cholula. We're driving the U.K. hot sauce category growth. We're taking meaningful progress across the region and expanding our distribution and gaining share in the fast-growing discount channel. Our investments in brand marketing, merchandising and new products are proving to be effective in driving growth. In the Asia Pacific region, growth for the quarter and the year was impacted by the exit of low-margin business in India, which we will have lapped after this quarter as well as the COVID-related disruptions in China. As we have moved past the Chinese New Year, we are seeing a return to normalization. We continue to expect a benefit beginning in the second quarter from lapping the impact of last year's disruptions.Outside of the China and India impact, growth in the region was driven by new products and brand marketing initiatives. Frank's RedHot and Cholula performance was strong in Australia and extending the power of our brands, we have launched Old Bay into the Australian market and Cholula into Southeast Asia. As always, we continue to fuel our Consumer segment growth with the power of our brands as well as our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives. We're excited about the growth plans we're executing and expect they will drive an acceleration of growth for the balance of the year. First, as we mentioned at CAGNY, we are completely renovating our U.S. core everyday spice of portfolio with consumer-preferred packaging as well as through leveraging new flavor seal technology.The atmosphere in the bottle is nitrogen flushed to remove oxygen, which means visibly fresher flavor, brighter color and stronger aroma. The modern new Snap-type trademark lid seals in the aroma and freshness. We're also printing the product names and an easy-to-read Best Buy date on the top. The new high-quality bottle and label design highlights the transparency and quality of our spices and herbs, and the bottle is made of 50% post-consumer recycled plastic, approximately a 20% carbon footprint reduction from the current package. We are really excited about these changes and so are consumers. Testing has confirmed 40% higher freshness per session, 2x higher preference and a 25% increase in loyalty among current buyers. The products began rolling out last month.The transition on store shelves will happen over the course of the year, supported with our highest spend brand marketing campaign of the past five years. Importantly, the new packaging fits right into the existing shelf stock. This is a seamless transition for our retail partners that we expect to drive category performance. This initiative, coupled with other new product introductions, I'll mention in a minute, along with our stabilized service levels, will build total distribution points and market share improvement as we go through the year as we outlined last month at CAGNY. We're also expanding into the fast-growing Mexican aisle with authentic Mexican flavor of Cholula in new formats. We are launching Cholula Taco recipe as well as sauces based on authentic Mexican formulas and crafted in Mexico using locally sourced fresh tomatoes and.Retail acceptance has been strong and consumers will find these new products and the authenticity they are looking for on U.S. shelves soon. Product began shipping yesterday ahead of, and the rollout will continue over the course of the second quarter. We're launching new products in the first half of 2023 to inspire consumers flavor exploration as well as the opinions consumers are looking for. In the Americas, we are kicking off the grilling season with new flavors including a Griller's Choice marinate you can use as three different flavors. And we're really excited about our new Stubs Master series made with technology from our FONA acquisition, these dry seasoning rubs capture real authentic hardwood smoke flavor. Leveraging the product successes of 2022, we are extending our Tabitha brown line into new flavors, formats and channels, and we're also launching a French's creamy roasted garlic mustard.In direct-to-consumer, we continue to grow our platform with new innovative flavors as a testing ground and in the club channel, we're launching a world flavors line. In EMEA, we're enabling consumers to discover the authentic taste of America by introducing old Bay to the U.K. market as well as introducing a new line of products leveraging the French's brand, including American favorites recipe. In the U.K., we also just launched Schwartz brand gravy, which are beating the top competitor on taste. In APZ, we've recently launched meal basis, a favorite Keane's recipes and will be launching a Gourmet Garden SD lemon paste, both making consumers flavor exploration easier. In China, we've introduced new packaging for our Chicken Bullion product, a pouch with a resealable port cap that makes it convenient for consumers and extends the open product shelf life by locking up moisture.We're continuing to build our heat platform across all regions with the launch of new products, including in the U.S., Gourmet Nashville hot chicken season, Frank's RedHot Dill Pickle hot sauce and a Cholula reserve crafted with 100% tequila and our flavor forecast of the year, Vietnam's agent sale season. In China, we're introducing iconic Chinese city spicy blend and then the U.K. Frank's RedHot spicy recipe mixes. Across all regions, we're increasing our brand marketing investments in 2023 and expect the most significant year-over-year increase in the second quarter. We will continue to support our brands with messaging on everyday use, value and the superiority of our ingredients and flavors and more specifically, with mustard supply issues resolved, we've launched a flavor on campaign for mustard or elevating our mother of sauce, Cholula campaign to support the launch of the new format and capitalize on.And of course, with grilling season starting during the quarter, we plan to reach grillers with our just flame and flavor campaign. A robust growth plan gives us confidence in continuing to drive positive momentum. We believe they will all be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, differentiating us even more and strengthening our flavor leadership in core categories. Turning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 9. Our sales performance in this segment continues to be outstanding. This was our eighth consecutive quarter with double-digit sales growth. Our first quarter growth was led by pricing actions in all three regions, which as we expected, accelerated versus previous quarters. Now for regional highlights. Our Americas first quarter strong sales growth was led by our Flavors product category.Within Flavors, snack seasoning growth was strong including volume growth related to new products and strengthen our customers' iconic products, partially fueled by their marketing as well as our improved ability to service our customers as we began to realize the benefit of the capacity we're bringing online. Flavors for Performance Nutrition and health end market applications also contributed to our strong performance as we continue driving double-digit sales growth. We are winning with new customers and new products. Volume was tempered in the quarter by the pruning of some low-margin business. The impact of a very cold December on the away-from-home part of our portfolio and lower volume of alcoholic beverage flavors due to what must have been a drier January than last year.Supermarket, food, shoppingPhoto by Hanson Lu on UnsplashIn EMEA, we continue to drive broad-based growth across the portfolio, which was led by higher sales to our quick service restaurant customers in the first quarter. Overall, our price realization nearly doubled versus last quarter. And in APC, we delivered solid volume growth in the markets outside of China, driven by demand from quick service restaurants, or QSRs, for our products to heat up their hot and spicy offerings. Overall, labor solutions demand has remained strong, particularly in certain parts of our business in our Americas and EMEA regions. As we continue to bring additional capacity online and reduce both supply chain pressure and the extraordinary cost to service our customers, we appreciate their patience and collaboration. We're continuing our positive sales growth momentum in Flavor solutions, and we're committed to restoring profitability in this segment, recovering margin while ensuring we keep our customers in supply and driving growth for both McCormick and our customers.We're confident we will achieve margin recovery. In our January earnings call, we set our price increases had just begun to catch up with the pace of inflation and we were beginning to recover the cost inflation or pricing lag in the last two years. This is continuing at an even greater rates in the first quarter. And earlier, I discussed cost through our two lead program, which will contribute to the Flavor Solutions margin recovery. GOE will have a significant impact in the Flavor Solutions segment. And finally, we continue to focus on driving growth in high-margin parts of our portfolio such as the flavor product category volume growth I mentioned a few minutes ago in the Americas region. Now I'm excited to share the growth plans we're executing on and expect will continue to drive our growth momentum.We continue to fuel our Flavor Solutions segment growth using our differentiation, including our culinary foundation, our unique and powerful consumer insights advantage, our proprietary technologies and our passion for providing our customers with a differentiated collaborative experience. While we cannot get too specific about product development, following a strong year of innovation in 2022, we carried a robust new product pipeline into 2023. As we mentioned at CAGNY, we are specifically targeting opportunities to grow in high-growth end markets. Applications such as savory snacks, alcoholic beverages and Performance Nutrition and have outpaced market growth and as I just shared, our robust growth momentum continued in the first quarter.As we expect it will the balance of the year, the capabilities we built for these categories are creating significant top line opportunities. The power of McCormick and FONA together continues to fuel greater opportunities for growth. This acquisition is exceeding our expectations. We're capitalizing on opportunities to increase our sales to existing customers by cross-selling across our more comprehensive product offering and target new customers. We're leveraging our global footprint and capabilities to drive future growth. We are currently in the process of expanding performance nutrition into Canada as well as localizing confectionery flavors in for our FONA customer. Finally, in branded foodservice, we have a robust 2023 innovation agenda, launching more than double the new items than in 2022, including Frank's RedHot, Nashville Hot, a line of Cholula Street Tacos, McCormick culinary Global blend and a French's portion control package.Our plans include continuing to leverage our culinary partnerships, inspire menu ideas with our customers, win placement on away-from-home menus, including with quick service restaurants and drive growth with promotional activities. Our robust growth plans in Flavor Solutions also give us confidence in continuing our growth trajectory and drive our Flavor Solutions leadership. Now for summary comments before turning it over to Mike. Turning to Slide 11. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we've intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. We continue to capitalize on the long-term consumer trends, healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices.McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on its demand for great taste, with the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio, we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion. Through our products and our customers' products and are driving growth, we are end-to-end flavor. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies give us confidence in our growth momentum and ability to continue navigating the dynamic mobile environment. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we will continue to focus on capitalizing on strong demand, optimizing our cost structure and positioning McCormick to deliver sustainable growth. We have robust growth plans in place including building momentum with our new products and heat platform and are delivering on our commitment to increasing our profit realization.We are confident with the successful execution of our planned and concrete actions we will drive profitable growth in 2023. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world as they drive our momentum and success. I want to also thank all of our customers, suppliers and investors for their collaboration and patients as we move beyond the unique environment we've been operating in since the onset of the pandemic. The fundamentals that drove our historical financial performance remain intact, and we are confident we will continue to not only deliver strong sales growth, but also drive total shareholder return at an industry-leading pace. Now, I'll turn it over to Mike.Mike Smith: Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 14. Our top line constant currency sales grew 5% compared to the first quarter of last year. This growth was tempered by a 2% unfavorable impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, the exit of the consumer business in Russia and lower consumption due to the COVID-related disruption in China. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales increased to 1%, reflecting a 9% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 3% volume decline related to the Kitchen Basics, Russia and China impacts I just mentioned as well as a 5% decline in all other volume and product mix. On Slide 15, consumer sales in the Americas increased 4% in constant currency, including a 2% decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture.Growth was broad-based across all product categories, driven by pricing actions, partially offset by lower volume. Lapping elevated demand due to Omicron in the first quarter of last year contributed to the volume decline. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 2%. Pricing actions were more than fully offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 4% unfavorable impact from the lower sales in Russia. Lapping elevated demand due to Omicron in the first quarter of last year contributed to the volume decline. Constant currency consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 8%, driven by a decline in volume, partially offset by pricing actions. The combination of lower volume in China due to COVID-related disruptions and the exit of lower-margin business in India drove an 11% reduction in volume.Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 18. We grew first quarter constant currency sales of 12%, reflecting a 13% increase from pricing actions and a 1% decline in volume and mix. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales rose 12%. Pricing actions contributed to higher sales across the customer base, which skews to packaged food and beverage companies as well as branded foodservice customers. Volume and product mix declined in the quarter as strong volume growth in snack seasonings and flavors for Performance Nutrition and health applications was more than fully offset by the impact of pruning of low-margin businesses and lower volume of away-from-home products as our customers' business was impacted by cold weather.In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 17%, with pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix. EMEA's Flavor Solutions outstanding growth was broad-based across its portfolio, led by higher sales to QSR customers. First quarter volume declined, driven primarily by softness in some of our packaged food and beverage customers volume within their own businesses. In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 5% in constant currency with pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix. Volume and product mix declined as the impact of scale back QSR activities in China due to COVID-related disruptions more than offset QSR volume growth outside of China. As seen on Slide 22, gross profit margin declined 80 basis points in the first quarter versus the year ago period.This is an improvement from our performance last year. While more work needs to be done, we are pleased with our progress and are confident in the actions underway to continue driving further improvement over the balance of the year. Gross margin in the quarter was impacted by several drivers. First, we're still incurring elevated costs in Flavor Solutions to meet high demand in certain parts of our business. While painful in the short term, we know making these investments to support our customers is the right approach to driving long-term growth. That said, we continue to progress on reducing the level of these costs in the first quarter. Also in Flavor Solutions, we incurred dual running costs related to the transition to our new U.K. Peterborough manufacturing facility.We expect the balance of the year costs to be comparable to 2022 and a sales shift between our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments as compared to last year unfavorably impacted gross margin. Partially offsetting the unfavorable drivers I just mentioned were our CCI-led cost savings as well as the cost savings from our GOE program that Lawrence discussed, and which were in line with our expectations. Finally, end of note, we offset current year inflation in the first quarter, which we expect will be the highest of the year through our pricing actions. And as Lawrence said, we continue to recover the cost inflation or pricing lagged over the last two years as we planned. While the net of these impacts drives gross profit dollar growth, there is level of dilution that tempers the actual gross margin percentage.Now moving to Slide 23. Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&amp;A, were comparable to the first quarter of last year. Higher distribution costs were offset by CCI-led and GOE cost savings as well as lower planned brand marketing and employee benefits expenses in the quarter. For the year, we continue to expect both brand marketing and employee benefits expenses to be higher than last year. As a percentage of sales, SG&amp;A declined 40 basis points, driven by leverage from sales growth. Higher sales, partially offset by lower gross margin, resulted in a constant currency increase in adjusted operating income of 2% compared to the first quarter of 2022. In constant currency, Consumer segment adjusted operating income increased 6%, and in the Flavor Solutions segment, it declined 11%.Turning to interest expense and income taxes on Slide 24. Our interest expense increased significantly over the first quarter of 2022, driven by the higher rate environment. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 21.8% compared to 19.7% in the year ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant impact last year. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 25, first quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.59 as compared to $0.63 for the year ago period. The decrease was due to higher interest expense and a higher first quarter adjusted effective tax rate. On Slide 26, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $103 million compared to $18 million in the first quarter of 2022.The increase was primarily driven by lower incentive compensation payments. We returned $105 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $62 million for capital expenditures this quarter. We expect 2023 to be a year of strong cash flow, driven by our profit and working capital initiatives. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating, and we have a history of strong cash generation and profit realization. Now turning to our financial outlook on Slide 27. Our 2023 outlook reflects our continued positive top line growth momentum and with the optimization of our cost structure, increased profit realization.We expect to drive margin expansion with strong sales and adjusted operating income growth that reflects the health of our underlying business performance as well as the net favorable impact from several discrete drivers. We expect our adjusted operating profit growth will be partially offset below operating profit by higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect there will be a minimal impact from currency rates, although there will be a timing aspect as we project an unfavorable act in the first half of the year and a favorable impact in the second half of the year. At the top line, we expect to grow sales 5% to 7%, driven primarily by the wrap of last year's pricing actions combined with new pricing actions we are taking in 2023.We expect several factors to impact our volume and product mix over the course of the year, including price elasticities, which are consistent with '22 at lower levels than we have historically experienced, but in line with the current environment. A 1% estimated benefit from lapping last year's impact of COVID-related disruptions in China, although we expect the impact will vary from quarter-to-quarter given 2022's level of demand volatility. The divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business in August of last year and the exit of our consumer business in Russia during last year's second quarter, and finally, the continual pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio. As always, we plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement plans.Our 2023 adjusted gross margin is projected to range between 25 to 75 basis points higher than 2022. Adjusted gross margin expansion reflects a favorable impact from pricing, cost savings from our CCI-led and GOE programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low to mid-teens increase in cost inflation. We expect cost pressures to be more than offset by pricing during the year as we recover the cost inflation or pricing lagged the last two years. Moving to adjusted operating income. First, let me walk through some discrete items and their expected impact to our 2023 adjusted operating profit growth. First, the cost savings from our GOE program are expected to have an 800 basis point impact. The savings from this program are expected to scale up as the year progresses.Next, the benefit of lapping the impact of COVID-related disruptions in China is expected to have a 300 basis point favorable impact. The Kitchen Basics divestiture is expected to have an unfavorable 100 basis point impact. And finally, an even 100 basis point unfavorable impact is expected as we build back incentive compensation. The net impact of these discrete items is a favorable 200 basis points. This favorable impact, combined with expected 7% to 9% underlying business growth, which is driven by our improved operating momentum, results in our adjusted operating income projection of 9% to 11%. In addition to the adjusted gross margin impacts I just mentioned, this projection also includes a further low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments and our CCI cost savings target of approximately $85 million.We are anticipating a meaningful step-up in interest expense, driven by the higher interest rate environment, which will impact our floating debt. We estimate that our interest expense will range from $200 million to $210 million in 2023 and spread evenly throughout the year. As a reminder, in 2022, we realized an $18 million favorable impact from optimizing our debt portfolio, which we will lap in 2023. The net impact of these interest-related items is expected to be approximately an 800 basis point headwind to our 2023 adjusted earnings per share growth. Our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 22% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts.Versus our 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, we expect this outlook is to be a 100 basis point headwind to our 2023 earnings growth. To summarize, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong underlying business growth of 8% to 10% and a 2% net favorable impact from the discrete items I just mentioned impacting profit, the GOE program, the China recovery, the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the employee benefit cost rebuild, partially offset by the combined interest and tax headwind of 9%. This results in an expected increase of 1% to 3% or a projected guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2023 of $2.56 to $2.61. We are projecting strong operating performance in 2023 with the continued top line momentum, significant optimization of our cost structure and strong adjusted operating profit growth as well as margin expansion.While this performance is expected to be tempered by interest and tax headwinds, we remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and that with the execution of our proven strategies, we will drive profitable growth in 2023.Lawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 29. Our first quarter sales growth reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio and the effective execution of our strategies. Our underlying business performance was driven by our pricing actions and strong ongoing demand. Our first quarter progress on margin improvement reflects the level of urgency with which we are addressing the pressure points from last year. We are committed to increasing our profit realization, and our actions are yielding results on optimizing our cost structure and recovering the cost inflation or pricing lag last year. We expect our progress to scale up as the year progresses.We have robust growth plans in place, including building momentum with product innovation and renovation and are driving improvement in our margin profile. We expect to drive profitable sales growth at an accelerated rate in the balance of the year and have bolstered confidence in delivering our outlook for 2023 in building shareholder value. The compounding benefit of our relentless focus on growth, performance and people continues to position McCormick to drive sales growth. This coupled with our focus on recovering cost inflation and lowering costs to expand margins, will allow us to realize long-term sustainable earnings growth.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Target (NYSE:TGT) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Target, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$4.0b ÷ (US$53b - US$20b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).Thus, Target has an ROCE of 12%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 11% generated by the Consumer Retailing industry. Check out our latest analysis for Target roceIn the above chart we have measured Target's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Target here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Target, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 16% over the last five years. However it looks like Target might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.In Conclusion...In summary, Target is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Yet to long term shareholders the stock has gifted them an incredible 149% return in the last five years, so the market appears to be rosy about its future. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.Story continuesOne more thing: We've identified   4 warning signs  with Target (at least 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable)  , and understanding these would certainly be useful.While Target may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Meanwhile, the retailer's app is also seeing an uptick in downloads. So far this year, downloads are close to 2 million, only slight lower than Amazon (AMZN), but higher than Target (TGT), Costco (COST) and BJ's (BJ).Now as consumers, including high-income shoppers, turn to Walmart for value amid inflation, the retail giant is getting a boost in foot traffic. While still below pre-pandemic levels, foot traffic, customers visiting the store, was up 2% in Q4. Same store sales? Up 8% and the average purchase was up 7%.""The traffic turn appears to be building, and with consumers across the demographic spectrum making wallet allocation choices after several years of record nominal retail spending, Walmart is poised to regain share,"" Melich said.Later in his note he said, ""Difficult times can also prove a catalyst for engaging new customers with Walmart, as Walmart’s core strengths in value and selection take on greater import (importance).""In the latest quarter, Q4, the crucial holiday period for retailers, total earnings came in at $5.81 billion, far higher than $3.6 billion in the year-earlier period. In the full fiscal year, total earnings came in slightly lower year-year-over. FY2023 saw $11.29 billion in total earnings. FY2022: $13.94 billion.Next week, Walmart is set to host its 2023 Investment Community Meeting. Melich said ""we might be early"" on these predictions, ""as the April analyst day could pose a risk if management tries to bludgeon the Street to their guidance range.""Story continues""That said,"" he added, ""with traffic momentum and margin expansion likely amidst a decelerating Retail world we like Walmart’s scale, balance sheet and stability.""Other reasons for optimism: Melich said Walmart's subsidiary, wholesale retailer Sam's Club, is ""building loyalty, traffic and renewal rates,"" making up 14% of sales. ""Sam’s comps (comparable sales) have averaged double-digits the past three-years,"" he said. Plus, Walmart's international profile, Walmex and Canada, also ""remain strong,"" making up 10% of sales, while China and India ""could see better sales and profit momentum as the world heals from COVID.""Store traffic on the up and up? A Miami Walmart. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (Joe Raedle via Getty Images)Shares of Walmart are up roughly 62% in the past five years. Still, Melich said buying in now could lead to a big return. Shares of the retail giant are outpacing the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC), which are up a little over 50% in the past five years.Melich is one of many bullish analysts on the Street when it comes to Walmart.

These properties meet the needs of a wide variety of manufacturers, significantly reducing the time required to construct facilities and ultimately bring products to market.To receive Platinum CSX Select Site designation, a location must pass a rigorous evaluation on criteria that include infrastructure and utility availability; environmental reviews; appropriate zoning and entitlement; air quality permitting, rail serviceability; proximity to highways or interstates, and other attributes.“The State of Kentucky’s commitment to improve roadway access to Commerce Park II is a game-changer for Hopkinsville,” said Christina Bottomley, vice president of Real Estate and Industrial Development at CSX. “With our investment in Casky Yard next to the Commerce Park site, CSX has long been interested in supporting a second planned rail-served industrial park for this community.”CSX introduced the Select Site program in 2012 to better serve new and existing customers on its network and those of its short line partners. CSX works with Austin Consulting, a nationally known site-selection consulting firm, to screen candidate sites and assist communities with the application and certification process.“We thank CSX and Austin Consulting for an exhaustive and worthwhile process to achieve this important designation,” said Carter Hendricks, director, South Western Kentucky Economic Development Council, the region’s three-county economic development organization.“With the successful original Commerce Park on the other side of the railroad tracks, all the necessary utilities are in place to serve additional industrial facilities,” said Bottomley. “For more than a decade, industrial-grade roadway access has been the missing piece of the puzzle for Commerce Park II.”Story continuesCommerce Park II – Rail Site is a 150-acre property adjacent to the CSX mainline and part of a larger planned 1,000-plus acre industrial park in southwest Hopkinsville. For much of the past decade, the larger property was considered and marketed as a potential “mega site,” capable of accommodating an entire automotive manufacturing facility. Last year, local leadership opted to subdivide the large property to accommodate multiple industrial facilities. In October, Ascend Elements began construction of its largest electric vehicle battery recycling and engineered materials manufacturing facility at Commerce Park II. This investment led to support from Kentucky’s Transportation Cabinet to design and build an elevated roadway over the CSX mainline, connecting site to US-41, a five-lane highway.“Having the CSX Select Site certification is another significant step forward for Commerce Park II and indicates the site is ready to help companies succeed. We encourage any company or industry to visit Commerce Park II and join our growing corporate family,” said Jerry Gilliam, Christian County Judge Executive.Since its introduction in 2012 as a key component of CSX’s industrial development efforts, the Select Site Program has attracted dozens of manufacturers, with capital investments projected to reach $14 billion and realize nearly 11,000 new jobs.“The City of Hopkinsville is excited to learn of the important Platinum CSX Select Site designation. With over 1,000 acres ready for development, Commerce Park II is an incredible rail site with unmatched logistics, workforce, and cost of doing business”, said Mayor James R. Knight.The Commerce Park II – Rail Site is now the fourth site in Kentucky to have received the Platinum CSX Select Site designation. The property is one of 27 across CSX’s service territory to have met this rigorous site selection criteria.To learn more about CSX Select Sites, visit www.csxselectsites.comAbout CSX CSX, based in Jacksonville, Florida, is a premier transportation company.

Selling at the right time can ensure that your profits are maximized and help your portfolio’s profits compound over time. While there are many rules of thumb around when to sell a stock, a general rule is that it is a good idea to lock in your profits after a stock has climbed 20% -25%. However, in volatile times such as now, it can be smart to lock in any profits as markets gyrate up and down. While it can be difficult to time the market, it is easy to see when profits are there for the taking. And it would be frustrating for anyone to see a sizable profit of 20% or more vanish. While stock markets around the world remain volatile, many stocks have staged big rallies during this year’s first quarter and rebounded from the downturn of 2022. Here are three top growth stocks to take profits on now before the market’s next leg lower.RCLRoyal Caribbean Cruises$63.17NFLXNetflix$327AXPAmerican Express$161Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL)Royal Caribbean (RCL) ship Allure of the Seas, docked.Source: Laszlo Halasi / Shutterstock.comThings are looking up for the cruise-line industry as we approach the summer. The largest cruise lines are reporting record bookings for this year, with many of them noting that last year’s Black Friday was the single largest booking day in their histories. Some North American ports are preparing for a record number of ships in their harbors in coming months. This is great news for Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL), the second largest cruise line operator in the world after its rival, Carnival Corp. (NYSE:CCL).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRoyal Caribbean’s earnings have surpassed analysts’ average expectations in recent quarters as the company enjoys a rebound from the pandemic when its ships were stuck empty in ports.As Royal Caribbean prepares for what it says should be “historical occupancy levels” on its cruise ships this year, its stock has gained 33% in the last six months, including a 25% increase so far in 2023. While the stock’s run has been impressive, reasons to now sell RCL stock include high fuel prices, a strong U.S. dollar, and a potential recession, all of which have historically been problematic for the cruise industry.Story continuesNetflix (NFLX)The Netflix (NFLX) logo on a tablet with earbuds and a bowl of popcorn nearby.Source: Riccosta / Shutterstock.comThis time last year, the shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) were caught in an avalanche as investors dumped the stock amid declining subscriber numbers and analysts’ reports claiming the company’s best days were over. To its credit, Netflix responded quickly to control the damage and alleviate investors’ fears. In recent months, Netflix has rolled out a new, cheaper, streaming tier that is supported by advertisements and has begun cracking down on password sharing worldwide.Those efforts have helped NFLX stock recover, gaining nearly 50% in the past six months. So far this year, the stock is up 10%. While the bleeding has stopped and the share price has regained some of its lost ground, the current rebound feels tenuous.Netflix lives and dies by its number of new subscribers reported each quarter. Any miss on those forecasted numbers usually causes its share price to sell off heavily. Also, the competition that Netflix faces is only growing as seemingly every entertainment company moves to a streaming model to distribute content.Netflix is slated to report its first-quarter earnings on April 18. Take profits on NFLX while the stock is still riding high.American Express (AXP)an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocketSource: ShutterstockThe global banking crisis that roiled markets seems to be over for now. But investors, analysts and regulators remain nervous. A whisper that there is a problem at a large financial institution seems likely to send bank stocks lower. And that’s bad news for American Express (NYSE:AXP). While most investors know American Express as a leading credit card company, particularly when it comes to business travel, it is also the 17th largest bank in the U.S. and bigger than many regional banks, including the now defunct Silicon Valley Bank.This explains why AXP stock has sunk 10% in the last month. Before the banking crisis, American Express had been riding high on strong earnings and a bullish outlook. The company also raised its dividend payment by 15% and announced plans to buy back 120 million of its shares.These actions led to AXP stock staging a strong rally since last autumn. After bottoming at $139 a share in early November, the stock has gained 16%.But given how fragile sentiment around financial stocks is right now, the gains of AXP stock might not stick.

271,340012e1-d263-314a-b981-2cac4272ff47,ROST,2023-03-31,Why Is Ross Stores (ROST) Down 7.4% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ross-stores-rost-down-153003388.html,1680190203,STORY,['ROST'],"[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Ross Stores (ROST). Shares have lost about 7.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Ross Stores due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Ross Stores Beats Q4 Earnings &amp; Sales EstimatesRoss Stores reported robust fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate. The company’s results benefited from positive customer response to its improved merchandise and strong value offerings despite the competitive environment. Also, earnings improved year over year while sales declined. Sales were hurt by the ongoing inflationary pressure on its low-to-moderate income group customers.Ross Stores’ earnings of $1.31 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23 and our estimate of $1.19. Earnings also improved 26% from $1.04 reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.Total sales of $5,214.2 million dropped 3.9% year over year but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,130 million and our estimate of $5,108.5 million. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, comps improved 1% compared with growth of 9% in the year-ago quarter. Comps benefited from higher average basket size due to flat traffic trends compared with the last year.In the holiday season, the shoes category remained the key growth driver, with Florida being the top-performing region. Sales trends continued to improve at the dd’s DISCOUNTS format, similar to the Ross chain of stores. However, dd’s DISCOUNTS’ sales continued to trail Ross’ due to ongoing inflationary pressures, which are having a huge impact on dd’s low-income customers.Story continuesQ4 InsightsThe cost of goods sold (COGS) of $3,926.2 million increased 4% year over year. As a percentage of sales, COGS was 75.3%, marking a year-over-year increase of 15 basis points (bps). The increase resulted from higher distribution expenses, offset by a higher merchandise margin and lower buying expenses. Distribution costs rose 90 bps, owing to the unfavorable timing of pack-away-related expenses and deleverage from its new Houston distribution center. However, higher expenses were somewhat offset by a 5 bps occupancy deleverage and a 20 bps decline in domestic freight.Increased distribution expenses were offset by an 85 bps decline in buying costs due to lower incentive compensation. Also, the merchandise margin increased 15 bps in the quarter, owing to lower ocean freight, which was more than offset by higher markdowns.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses of $729.3 million declined 3.5% year over year. SG&amp;A, as a percentage of sales, contracted 105 bps year over year to 14%. The decrease resulted from lower incentive costs.The operating margin of 10.7% expanded 90 bps from 9.8% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2021. The increase can be attributed to lower freight and incentive costs, partly negated by the unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs.Store UpdateAs of Jan 28, 2023, Ross Stores operated 2,015 outlets, including 1,693 Ross stores across 40 states, the District of Columbia and Guam and 322 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 21 states.In first-quarter 2023, the company expects to open 19 stores, comprising 11 Ross and eight dd's DISCOUNTS stores. In fiscal 2023, it expects to open 100 stores, including 75 Ross and 25 dd’s DISCOUNTS. These openings do not include the plans to close 10 existing stores in fiscal 2023.FinancialsRoss Stores ended fiscal 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $4,551.9 million, long-term debt of $2,456.5 million and total shareholders’ equity of $4,288.6 million.As of the end of fiscal 2022, consolidated inventories declined 10.6% from the fiscal 2021 comparable period, reflecting a significant moderation from the first half of fiscal 2022. Average store inventory was slightly lower in the quarter than the 2021 holiday period. Pack-away merchandise represented 40% of the total inventories, in line with the prior year.The company bought back 2.1 million shares of common stock for $231 million in the fiscal fourth quarter. In fiscal 2022, it repurchased 10.3 million shares for an aggregate value of $950 million under its two-year, $1.9 billion authorization approved in March 2022. ROST is on track to repurchase the remaining $950 million under the existing plan in fiscal 2023.Recently, Ross Stores increased its quarterly cash dividend by 8% to 33.5 cents per share. The dividend is payable Mar 31, 2022, to shareholders of record as of Mar 14, 2022.For fiscal 2023, the company expects to spend $810 million on capital expenditures as it continues to make investments in stores, supply chain and merchant processes to support long-term growth and increase business efficiencies.OutlookThe company provided a conservative view for fiscal 2023, given the ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. For fiscal 2023, it expects comps to be relatively flat, whereas it posted a 4% decline in fiscal 2022. ROST envisions sales growth of 2-5% for the 53 weeks ending Feb 3, 2024.Based on the sales view, the company estimates the operating margin for fiscal 2023 to be 10.3-10.7%. The operating margin view incorporates the effects of the resetting of the baseline incentive compensation, higher wages, lower freight costs and the deleveraging effects of flat comps. The operating margin is also expected to benefit from the 53rd week to the tune of 20 bps.The company anticipates earnings per share of $4.65-$4.95 for the 53 weeks ended Feb 3, 2024, whereas it posted $4.38 in fiscal 2022. The extra 53rd week is expected to aid fiscal 2023 earnings per share by 15 cents.The company anticipates a net interest income of $115 million for fiscal 2023. Depreciation and amortization, including stock-based amortization, are expected to be $570 million. The fiscal 2023 tax rate is anticipated to be 24-25%, while shares outstanding are expected to be 339 million.For first-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects comps to be relatively flat for the 52 weeks ending Jan 27, 2024, whereas it reported 7% comps growth in the prior-year quarter. The comp performance is likely to reflect the continued impacts of elevated inflation on its low-to-moderate income customers. Sales are expected to increase 1-4% year over year in the fiscal first quarter.The company envisions the operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to be 9.6-9.9%, whereas it reported 10.8% in the prior year. The decline is expected to result from the deleveraging effect of comps performance, the unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and elevated wages. However, the company expects merchandise margins to benefit from lower freight costs.Earnings per share are envisioned between 99 cents and $1.05 for the fiscal first quarter. The company reported earnings of 97 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.ROST anticipates a net interest income of $28 million for the fiscal first quarter. The tax rate is expected to be 24-25%, while shares outstanding are estimated to be 341 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -10.53% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Ross Stores has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a B. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Ross Stores has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

276,782eeec3-76d1-3944-a0ce-80474bc939da,RF,2023-03-31,What Makes Regions Financial (RF) a New Buy Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-regions-financial-rf-buy-160004838.html,1680192004,STORY,['RF'],"[Regions Financial (RF) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Regions Financial is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Regions Financial, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Regions FinancialThis holding company for Regions Bank is expected to earn $2.57 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 8.4%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Regions Financial. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1.8%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Regions Financial to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.Regions Financial (RF) is a stock many investors are watching right now. RF is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 7.19 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 8.16. RF's Forward P/E has been as high as 10.98 and as low as 6.85, with a median of 8.94, all within the past year.Investors should also note that RF holds a PEG ratio of 0.71. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. RF's industry has an average PEG of 0.79 right now. Within the past year, RF's PEG has been as high as 0.93 and as low as 0.27, with a median of 0.61.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is RF's P/B ratio of 1.20. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.55. Over the past year, RF's P/B has been as high as 1.62 and as low as 1.13, with a median of 1.38.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that RF has a P/CF ratio of 6.63. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. RF's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 10. Within the past 12 months, RF's P/CF has been as high as 9.32 and as low as 6.23, with a median of 7.86.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Regions Financial's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that RF is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Amphenol (NYSE:APH), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Amphenol How Fast Is Amphenol Growing?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Shareholders will be happy to know that Amphenol's EPS has grown 18% each year, compound, over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. While we note Amphenol achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 16% to US$13b. That's encouraging news for the company!The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Amphenol's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are Amphenol Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$47b company like Amphenol. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$276m. We note that this amounts to 0.6% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Amphenol but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Story continuesIs Amphenol Worth Keeping An Eye On?For growth investors, Amphenol's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Amphenol's continuing strength. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 1 warning sign for Amphenol that you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

According to the Realtor.com® Monthly Housing Trends Report released today, the recent six-month surge in active listings lost momentum, moderating to 59.9% year-over-year, and time on market shrank to 54 days, from January's high of 74 days, as buyers eased back into the market in March, but higher mortgage rates could freeze them back out.""Signs show that buyers are active in the spring housing market, even if they aren't as numerous as they were during the pandemic. Amid fewer new choices on the market and still rising home prices, home shoppers have shown that they are very rate sensitive, only jumping back in the market when rates dip, and so what happens with rates this spring will likely play a strong role in determining whether the housing market bumps along or picks up speed this year,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""With so much built up equity, home sellers are still faring well, but many are sitting on the sidelines. The usual seasonal pick-up in buyer demand appears to be underway, one of several factors that make spring the Best Time to Sell. With an uncertain market ahead, it may be even more important for potential sellers to aim for this year's seasonal sweet spot.""Now may be the best time to sell, and homeowners need to put their best foot forwardIf homeowners are planning to sell in 2023, now is the time to get ready. Realtor.com®'s Best Time to Sell analysis found that nationally, the week of April 16-22, 2023 will bring sellers the best combination of market conditions this year, including higher home prices, fewer other homes for sale, a faster sale, and stronger demand.Story continues""Well-priced, move-in ready homes with curb appeal in desirable areas are still receiving multiple offers and selling for over the asking price in many parts of the country,"" said Realtor.com®'s Executive News Editor Clare Trapasso. ""So this spring, it's especially important for sellers to make their homes as attractive as possible to appeal to as many buyers as possible. They should make any necessary repairs, spruce up the landscaping, and invest in staging and professional photographs. Homes that are priced too high, are in need of major repairs, or aren't presented professionally are often sitting on the market for longer and sometimes selling for under the initial asking price.""March 2023 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over March 2022Change over March 2019Median listing price+6.3% (to $424,000)+38.8 %Active listings+59.9 %-49.5 %New listings-20.1 %-26.9 %Median days on market+18 days (to 54 days)-18 daysShare of active listings with price reductions+6.8 percentage points (to 12.6%)-2.3 percentage points Lack of new homes coming on to the market a drag on home salesThe U.S. inventory of active listings continued to climb in March over last year's lows, but the rate of growth cooled slightly from the brisk pace seen the previous two months. With new listings remaining scarce in March, the rise in the number of homes for sale is a reflection of more time spent on the market compared to last year rather than an influx of new sellers. A lack of new homes to the market continues to be a drag on home sales; attitudes toward housing worsened in February, especially among potential sellers, which likely signals ongoing weakness in the number of new homes for sale this year. Higher interest rates continue to create affordability challenges for buyers, and fewer homes went under contract compared to last year.The U.S. supply of active listings for sale rose 59.9% compared to this time last year, but it is still 49.6% below pre-pandemic 2017 - 2019 levels, on average. There were 211,000 more homes available to buy in March compared to one year ago.Newly-listed homes for sale continued to fall in March (-20.1%) compared to this time last year. This is a higher rate of decline than last month's 15.9% decrease and 29.7% below pre-pandemic 2017 - 2019 levels. Pending listings, or homes under contract with a buyer, declined year-over-year (-24.5%).The number of homes for sale across the 50 largest metros was up 74.4% compared to a year ago. The South saw the highest growth in active listings (+127.4%).Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, 47 markets saw active inventory increase compared to last March, with the most growth in Austin (+312.2%), Raleigh (+273.7%), and Nashville (+253.3%). Only three markets had inventory declines on a year-over-year basis, including Milwaukee (-17.2%), Hartford (-17.0%), and New York (-0.9%).Home prices continue to rise but could decline compared to last year as early as summerIn March, national median list prices continued to rise year-over-year, but the rate at which prices are rising slowed to the lowest level since June 2020, in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. At this rate of slowing, list prices could decline relative to last year as early as this summer, following the recent national median sale price decline, which fell annually for the first time in 10 years last month. The share of homes with price reductions is up significantly from last year, but dipped below 2017–2019 pre-pandemic levels in February and continued to decline in March, indicating that the smaller number of homeowners who are putting their homes up for sale appear to be readjusting their home price expectations to the realities of today's market.The national median listing price was $424,000 in March, up from $415,000 in February. Annual list price growth continued to slow to 6.3% over last year, the lowest rate of growth since June 2020, in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, the biggest annual listing price gains continue to be in the Midwest, up 14.1%, on average from last year. The metros with the biggest asking price increases were Memphis, Tenn. (+40.3%), Milwaukee (+26.3%), and Kansas City, Mo. (+17.7%); however, in these metros the mix of inventory also changed and more larger, expensive homes are for sale today.In March, 12.6% of active listings had their price reduced, up from 5.8% a year ago.Nine out of the largest 50 markets saw their median list price decline in March. Large southern metros (+9.1 percentage points) continued to see the largest increase in the share of listings with price reductions, and the greatest year-over-year declines in the median list price were seen in Austin, Texas (-8.4% year-over-year), Las Vegas (-6.7%), and New Orleans (-5.1%).Homes are taking longer to sell, but not as long as pre-pandemic levelsA typical home spent more time on market compared to last year, although after rising steadily from summer 2022, the usual seasonal pickup in the sales pace shrank the gap and homes sold faster in March than in January and February, suggesting that buyers are active in the market, even if they are not as numerous as this time last year. Even though the typical home listing was on the market for more than two weeks longer than this time last year, homes are still selling just over two weeks faster on average than before the pandemic boom.In March, the typical home spent 54 days on market, 18 days longer than this time last year, but still 15 days faster than the pre-pandemic March 2017-2019 average.Across the 50 largest U.S. metros, time on market was lower in March relative to the national pace, 46 days on average, and was 16 days slower than March 2022.Time on market increased compared to last year in all 50 metros with the greatest increases in Raleigh, N.C.

286,0a466943-f6d6-3ff5-8e71-96ecbacb1a08,VZ,2023-03-31,Verizon continues to upgrade Riverside's best network,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-continues-upgrade-riversides-best-130000217.html,1680181200,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Sourcing LLCRecent upgrades lead to testing results that show Verizon’s network is unbeaten in RiversideRIVERSIDE, Calif., March 30, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verizon has recently made major upgrades to the network serving customers in Riverside, CA. These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Riverside include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Verizon engineers have been aggressively deploying 5G Ultra Wideband in the areas of Riverside and San Bernardino. That coverage has been expanded recently with the addition of new macro cell sites and small cell sites which provide service using both Verizon’s C-band coverage layer spectrum and Millimeter Wave (mmWave) spectrum, its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity. Service covers communities including 60 Freeway in the Badlands area, I-15 through the Cajon Pass, and the city of Fontana. Additionally, 5G service is available at the Mission Inn Hotel &amp; Spa, Market Street through downtown Riverside, providing service to Riverside City Hall, Superior Court of California, County of Riverside - Hall of Justice, Riverside County Office of Education, Riverside Community Hospital, and Riverside City College.Riverside’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Until this year in Riverside, Verizon has been restricted to using 60 MHz of the spectrum they secured, but by the end of this year, customers in Riverside will be able to take advantage of 100 MHz of C-band, almost doubling the spectrum available for 5G Ultra Wideband. That additional spectrum will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Riverside. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Riverside area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Story continues“Today’s world calls for faster speeds, ultra secure connections and improved coverage in more places. We’re dedicated to bringing the best and latest technologies to local communities, and to keeping our customers connected through 5G,” said Phillip French, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon.With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways. This multi-service network powersInternet-of-Things (IoT) devices that do very little networking and stay in place,smartphones with infinite opportunities to use data in a highly mobile environment,home and business internet which provides connectivity via the wireless network for homes, offices and retail environments, andcomplex solutions like Augmented Reality or enterprise real-time video and data analysis that require massive computing capabilities.As 5G technology advances and is even more widely adopted by consumers the variety of solutions that will use Verizon’s network will continue to evolve as well.Riverside, CA customers have the best experience on Verizon’s networkThe recent network upgrades have led to customers and visitors to Riverside, CA having the best experience when using the Verizon network, according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®. In the most recent test measuring performance of major wireless carriers throughout Riverside, Verizon wins for overall network performance, and in fact is unbeaten in every single category tested including accessibility, reliability, speed and performance in texts and calls. Today’s results show great speeds for Verizon customers in Riverside with Verizon’s median download speed increasing 30% since last year* in the market and peak speeds of up to 340 Mbps.Services from the network customers rely onFor customers in Riverside, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps. It’s ideal for anyone who wants super fast connectivity to stream, game or even work remotely. Verizon Home Internet is reliable and fast enough to power home connected devices: smart TVs, tablets, phones, gaming consoles and more. Plans start at just $25 per month with AutoPay and a select 5G mobile plan – all without extra fees, equipment charges, annual contracts or data caps.** Go to verizon.com/home for availability.

287,db9c9b64-ca0a-34df-9c00-7f4a14e851a9,VZ,2023-03-31,Verizon continues to upgrade Grand Rapids’ best network,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-continues-upgrade-grand-rapids-130000841.html,1680181200,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Sourcing LLCRecent upgrades lead to testing results that show Verizon’s network is unbeaten in Grand RapidsGRAND RAPIDS, Mich., March 30, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verizon has recently made major upgrades to the network serving customers in Grand Rapids, MI. These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Grand Rapids include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:74% of people in Grand Rapids are covered with 5G Ultra Wideband service. That coverage has been expanded recently with the addition of seven new macro cell sites and eight new small cell sites which have enhanced service in Rockford, Byron Center, Walker, Kentwood and downtown GR, East Grand Rapids.In addition to adding more 5G service using C-band spectrum, Verizon is also deploying 5G service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity. Verizon has recently added mmWave most notably near East Grand Rapids, Eastown and Wyoming.Grand Rapids’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Until this year in Grand Rapids, Verizon has been restricted to using 100 MHz of the spectrum they secured, but by the end of this year, customers in Grand Rapids will be able to take advantage of 200 MHz of C-band, doubling the spectrum available for 5G Ultra Wideband. That additional spectrum will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Grand Rapids. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Grand Rapids area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Story continues“Verizon is committed to delivering the most reliable network experience and meeting our customer’s connectivity needs, no matter where they are. Our reliable, secure network connects families, friends, homes and businesses in Grand Rapids with our best-in-class 5G ultra wideband technology,” said Dean Brauer, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon.With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways. This multi-service network powersInternet-of-Things (IoT) devices that do very little networking and stay in place,smartphones with infinite opportunities to use data in a highly mobile environment,home and business internet which provides connectivity via the wireless network for homes, offices and retail environments, andcomplex solutions like Augmented Reality or enterprise real-time video and data analysis that require massive computing capabilities.As 5G technology advances and is even more widely adopted by consumers the variety of solutions that will use Verizon’s network will continue to evolve as well.Grand Rapids, MI customers have an exceptional experience on Verizon’s networkThe recent network upgrades have led to Verizon’s network being unbeaten in Grand Rapids, MI according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®.

Now, its continued efficiency with EIS is a testament to its contracting capabilities,” GSA stated.The 12-year contract with Verizon, awarded in August 2020, covers all 10 of the agency's operating components, and its Office of the Secretary. The EIS contract vehicle combined separate awards into a single, streamlined contract. The result is a solution that will save HHS an estimated $700 million over the life of the task order, resulting from scale and interactions between data and voice, HHS officials said.“Large federal agencies faced unprecedented challenges as they transitioned their communications infrastructure contracts to the new EIS vehicle by the September 2022 deadline, especially when they had multiple, separate awards and/or contracts,” said Maggie Hallbach, Senior Vice President, Public Sector at Verizon. “Our Verizon Public Sector team has had an extraordinary opportunity to work with HHS to architect a single, streamlined EIS contract vehicle that is accelerating their transition to advanced networking technologies and unlocking new capabilities and opportunities.”The combining of both voice and data technologies into a single EIS task order, awarded to Verizon by HHS, has also been credited by leaders in the federal government as a model for success that can be emulated by other federal entities participating in the EIS program.Story continuesVerizon Communications Inc.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Consumer Discretionary Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.The consumer discretionary sector took a hit last year as shoppers tend to cut back on discretionary spending when they feel the heat of inflation. As the Federal Reserve launched its rate hike onslaught to tame inflation, consumers started to tighten their belts. As of the end of 2022, the consumer discretionary subindex was down a whopping 37%, compared to a 19% decline of the S&amp;P 500 index. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 consumer staples subindex was down just by 2.7% in the period.However, the consumer discretionary sector started to post a comeback this year as the market saw a strange optimism. As of February 7, consumer discretionary was one of the top-performing sectors of the S&amp;P 500 in 2023.While the Federal Reserve has indicated its plan to keep raising interest rates in 2023 amid rising inflation and a strong labor market, some believe consumer spending will remain strong. Retail spending in January jumped 3% from December on a seasonally adjusted basis. This spending growth was surprisingly boosted by vehicles, furniture, clothing and dining out. According to a Wall Street Journal report, Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, believes consumer spending will remain strong as long as labor market, wage growth and savings rates hold up.While consumer discretionary sector is sensitive to interest rate hikes, the industry is full of companies that are paying attractive dividends. These companies are expected to benefit in the long term when the market begins to recover. That’s why investing in consumer discretionary dividend stocks which have strong yields and dividend safety is a decent bet for long-term investors.Best Consumer Discretionary Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/Story continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their stock holdings as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 and picked 15 consumer discretionary dividend stocks that had the highest number of hedge fund investors.

(NYSE:AAP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also found an opportunity to add to our existing position in Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (NYSE:AAP) as the stock fell and the risk/reward profile improved. Advance underperformed early in the quarter as lower-quality sector peers bounced significantly. In August, shares fell further after the company reported second quarter earnings that disappointed because of weakerthan-expected same-store sales. Furthermore, management reduced its full-year earnings outlook by ~4%, citing softening consumer purchasing patterns within AAP’s “do-it-yourself” business.The most important driver of Advance Auto’s earnings power seems to be the management team’s ability to improve margin expansion. However, the market remains myopically focused on sales growth. The margin expansion opportunity originates from the consolidation of an overly complex and inefficient distribution network. Management is planning to roll out new distribution center. software through 2023 that will reduce costs, improve network productivity, and enhance customer experience through better inventory availability.In addition, the auto parts retailing industry tends to be less cyclical than the Consumer Discretionary sector because consumers often hold onto their used cars longer and make necessary repairs rather than buy new vehicles when their financial prospects are weakened. AAP is currently trading at less than 12 times forward earnings, well below the company’s long-term median P/E of more than 15—while having significant room to improve profitability owing to its self-help initiatives.”7.

In February, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, in line with the previous dividend.

The sales growth was driven by strong demand of its F-150 trucks.Here is what Leaven Partners has to say about Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”6. Vail Resorts, Inc.

Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is approaching an eye-watering 90% return this quarter — its best in over two decades.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Markets have seemingly entered a time warp — where last year's losers are this year's winners, and vice versa. Tech stocks are bringing the FAANG vibes from 2021 and before.But peering under the market's hood reveals some critical differences between 2023 and the prior era of preternaturally low interest rates when FAANGs flourished.First, the bond market has been turned on its head since the Fed began furiously raising rates a year ago. The 40-year down trend in interest rates that existed prior is now reversing.Markets never go straight up (or down), but a reprieve this year from higher rates has facilitated an echo of the prior era with tech stocks surging as interest rates wane. Suffice to say, knee-jerk reversions to the mean do not a trend make.Second, concentration worries are surfacing again. Investors may remember concerns that megacaps were accounting for a disproportionate share of the gains in the major indices during certain stretches from 2017 to 2021.Those concerns are back, though for different reasons.Story continuesCurrently, the top ten Nasdaq 100 stocks account for nearly all of the gains this year in the Nasdaq 100 (88%). Apple and Microsoft alone account for 13.2% of the S&amp;P 500's composition, the highest level since Ma Bell (T) and Big Blue (IBM) ruled the roost in 1978.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Companies no longer have access to cheap capital. The longer rates stay high, the more small companies will fail. The Nasdaq 100 is outperforming its broader cousin, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), by 375 basis points this year, which reflects this strength of its higher-market cap constituents.To illustrate just how long these things can play out, recall that stat about Nvidia from above.The chipmaker is about to post its best quarter since the fourth quarter of 2001, when it soared 144%. That monster rally began in the midst of a U.S. recession and a bear market in the Nasdaq that spanned three years. The following year in 2002, Nvidia would go on to crash 90% (top to bottom) before finding its footing in October.Currently, there are a few tailwinds that could boost the major indices further. Investor sentiment is skewing bearish, which is complementary to bulls in a contrarian fashion. And even with recent gains, the best-performing index, the Nasdaq 100, isn't yet overbought according to market technicals on all but the shortest time frames.But longer-term, investors must contend with (1) an economy that has yet to fully adjust to the reality of materially higher rates versus 2021 and before, and (2) a Fed that has so far kept its hawkish promises.Markets don't like uncertainty. Unfortunately, it's still uncertainty that reigns.What to Watch TodayEconomyPersonal income, February (+0.3% expected, +0.6% previously); Personal spending, February (+0.3% expected, +1.8% previously); MNI Chicago PMI, March (43.9 expected, 43.6 previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, March (63.4 expected, 63.4 previously)EarningsNo notable companies set to report.—Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

Over the last two days, though, you're looking at gains of nearly 10%. Now, that move came after the company said that its new server chips are going to arrive sooner than expected. Investors seem to be excited about this.Well, let's talk about all of what this means here for the company going forward. For that, I want to bring in Angelo Zino here of CFRA. Angelo, it's great to have you here. So we saw a pop in the stock today. And Intel, it's really been going gangbusters over the last month, on track for its best month here in just over, what, 20 years. Enough to think that this momentum is going to continue?ANGELO ZINO: I mean, it's tough to say. We wouldn't necessarily wouldn't be kind of chasing the stock here, but listen, you kind of saw the news yesterday in terms of them announcing a new CPU server in terms of, you know, proposed in 2025, that being their Clearwater Forest CPU. And I think what's most important here are what we got indications of yesterday, is that execution wise, everything is kind of going on as planned. And that was really kind of the problem with Intel's story over the last five years. It's the fact that execution has continued to be an issue with the company with the prior management team. And that really kind of allowed them to lose significant share.And now that we're actually seeing execution actually on par here, that, at the very least, is an incremental positive. Now, you need to continue to see that execution play out here over the next two years. And I wouldn't necessarily say it's clear sailing from here. And thus-- and this is a company that continues to burn cash, will burn cash through the rest of this year, likely next year, because of some of their expansion initiatives out there. So, personally, we wouldn't be chasing the stock here, but definitely good news from what we've seen here in recent days.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Of course, so much of the oxygen, Angelo, has been taken up by Nvidia and their progress in AI and links to ChatGPT. How significant is the gap between Intel and Nvidia and others in the AI space?ANGELO ZINO: Yeah, I mean, listen. I mean, clearly, these companies all specialize in different areas of the market. And on Nvidia's side of things, it's all about GPUs. And our view and what we've told investors out there is the wallet share will go to the accelerators out there. And clearly, the accelerators are the companies, the GPU providers, the FPGAs, the Asic chips out there. But Nvidia is really the only pure play to do it out there.In terms of Intel, their kind of bread and butter out there is really on the CPU side of things. And our view is CPUs are going to be a much slower type of business out there. As far as Intel is concerned at least, if you are getting into the stock here, at least you're getting into it at the trough of a cycle, or at least, we think we're at the trough of a cycle here. And again, they do have some, you know, great chipsets coming out here over the next two years. And as long as they execute there, it should be a positive for them. But as far as we're concerned, we continue to favor the more accelerator type of names, so an Nvidia out there, to a lesser extent, AMD.SEANA SMITH: All right, so Angelo, that's your take on semis on the chip sector.]"

The COVID-19 outbreak brought about a rapid increase in patients, rising healthcare requirements, workforce scarcities, and difficulties in supply chain management. In response, healthcare providers turned to innovative solutions like telemedicine and electronic health records (EHRs) to tackle these problems effectively. These digital technologies were aimed at reducing costs, managing fluctuating demand patterns, addressing the shortage of medical personnel, and improving readiness for potential future global health crises.There is a growing need for healthcare services from small businesses, including clinics, labs, and other providers that cater to local communities. Despite the ongoing trend of consolidation into larger healthcare groups and hospitals, it is predicted that the number of small healthcare practices will increase in 2023. According to IBISWorld, the number of companies that specialize in primary care is expected to rise steadily at a yearly rate of 1.6%, reaching 152,496 businesses by 2027. The outlook for the healthcare sector is predicted to be neutral in 2023 due to various factors, such as a rise in demand for services, the use of a more affordable and personalized delivery approach, progress in business technology, and the capacity to adjust to the evolving healthcare environment.In 2023, healthcare expenses are expected to decrease in real terms due to high inflation rates and sluggish economic growth, as per a report by Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). This scenario will prompt the need for difficult decisions on how to provide care. The healthcare system will continue to digitize, but there will be stricter regulations on the use of health data in the US, Europe, and China. Patent cliffs for vital drugs and attempts to regulate pharmaceutical pricing in countries such as the US and India will lead major pharma companies to pursue growth via mergers and acquisitions. Despite investing in more localized pharmaceutical production, drugmakers' expenses will still increase due to ongoing supply chain disruptions. Story continuesAmid this market outlook, some of the best medical stocks to invest in include Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), and DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM).

Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) designs, manufactures, and promotes Invisalign transparent braces, as well as iTero dental scanners and related services. These products are aimed at orthodontists and general dental practitioners, and are sold both in the United States and internationally, including in Switzerland and China. On February 6, Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) announced a new accelerated share buyback agreement with Citibank to repurchase $250 million of the company’s common stock.On February 2, Elizabeth Anderson, an analyst at Evercore ISI, increased the target price for Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) from $230 to $375 and maintained an Outperform rating on the company's shares. According to the firm, Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN)’s Q4 financial results were better than expected, and the outlook for Q1 suggests a positive trend for 2023 and beyond. Although 2023 may still have some fluctuations, the company's operational performance is improving, and there may be approximately $1 billion worth of share repurchases during the year. Evercore ISI believes that there are both fundamental and technical reasons to continue investing in Align Technology. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 34 hedge funds were bullish on Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN), compared to 38 funds in the prior quarter. Brian Bares’ Bares Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 935,246 shares worth $197.2 million. In addition to Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), and DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) is one of the best medical stocks to invest in. Meridian Contrarian Fund made the following comment about Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN), is a leader in the orthodontic industry that pioneered the clear aligner segment with its well-known Invisalign ™ product. Pandemic-related disruptions to earnings and the impact of tough foreign exchange rates on Align’s significant international business pushed the stock’s valuation to what we believed was an attractive level. We believe the company remains an industry leader and that clear aligners, which hold an industry penetration rate of roughly 15%, have a long runway for growth, so we initiated a position during the quarter.”12. DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) offers kidney dialysis services to patients in the United States who have chronic kidney failure. The company runs centers where patients can receive dialysis treatment and also provides laboratory services at outpatient dialysis centers. Additionally, DaVita Inc.

(NYSE:DVA) shares from $76 to $90 and maintained an Outperform rating. According to the analyst, the labor costs in Q4 did not experience a significant decline compared to the previous quarter, despite the company's guidance in October. However, it is worth noting that DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) has raised the lower end of its guidance, which suggests a positive outlook for the company's future performance, the analyst wrote in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 34 hedge funds were bullish on DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), compared to 30 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 36 million shares worth $2.7 billion. Moon Capital made the following comment about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)11.

(ABC), a leading national pharmaceutical distributor, provides an example of our approach. The company has been quietly bolstering its business model during the past few years to include animal health products for the European market and an expanded line of higher-margin, value-added services that reach beyond drug distribution. During these efforts, valuations for the company have been under pressure due to liability issues stemming from opioid litigation as well as concerns about increased scrutiny of drug prices by politicians.Our team has been following these developments and believes the strides management has made on the business side are not being fully recognized by the market. As more clarity has emerged related to opioid litigation, we’ve increased the portfolio’s stake in AmerisourceBergen and believe the investment provides the portfolio with additional exposure to a high-quality business that is well positioned to grow despite operating in a mature industry.”8.

When we first established the position in 2018, we explained that, “Although headlines remind us daily of growing threats to the business, the actual probability of this business dramatically changing in the next five years is much lower than the perceived probability. We are simply betting that the future might not be as bad as the price suggests.”Consensus FY22 and FY23 EPS estimates at the time were around $17 – $18 per share. The company reported ~ $24 in earnings in FY22, and is on pace for $26 in FY23, even as consensus estimates for the broader market were repeatedly revised lower. We continued to trim our position throughout the year as shares rerated higher from ~ 8x earnings in FY18 to ~ 16x earnings at recent highs.”6.

There was a note out from Laura Martin over at Needham earlier today talking about Apple potentially buying Disney, what that would do for Apple's business. She's saying that that's going to unlock an upside of about valuation upside of 15% to 25%. Any strategic value for Apple in potentially buying Disney?ANGELO ZINO: Listen, I think it would be absolutely great. I mean, if you think about Apple here and what they could potentially buy out there, at Disney would make all the sense in the world from the perspective that that's a high-quality type of company in absolute great brand. And to have the opportunity to buy, that would be great. In our view though, that's not happening.If you're thinking about Apple here, clearly, in the past, they've never done anything north of 3 billion in terms of beats in terms of M&amp;A. And they're going to keep, continue to do what they've done in the past. And that is buy back their stock and buy back it aggressively. So in our view, that's probably boring for investors to hear. But in our view, probably the right call.- So would you rule out M&amp;A altogether for Apple in the year ahead?ANGELO ZINO: I think it's tough because-- and then you have to think about Apple here. I mean, they typically do make about an acquisition per month. Or at least that's what they've said in the past. So they do M&amp;A. But it's typically on a smaller scale side of things, very small, incremental to their business. And when you start thinking about some of the regulatory issues out there and what, you know, from the political standpoint, what they want to see from big tech out there, I think the last thing they really want to see is significant M&amp;A or large M&amp;A from these bigger tech companies. So in our view, they probably steer clear of it.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Angelo, Apple also announced a worldwide developers conference in June. Lots of talk about that, mixed reality headset. Does that move the needle at all? How big of a hit if we do get it could that product potentially be do you think?ANGELO ZINO: Yeah, I mean, as far as we're concerned in '23 and probably '24, it's not going to move the needle. I think it's a positive and incremental positive, especially for their wearables segment out there. It's a small-- overall, their wearables division about 10% of their revenue. So this has the potential if you're looking at about 1,000,000 to 2 million in potential sales here over the next year. It has the potential to move at least the wearables segment incrementally, but nothing kind of that's necessarily going to move the top line significantly.But again, it does increase their addressable market. We think it's important longer term for them to continue to find these new opportunities and expand that addressable market. So for from my perspective, this is going to be a flagship device where you're going to see kind of lower price points over time where they can potentially kind of get generate more revenue over time. But over the next 12 to 18 months, it's not a big deal in our view.- Elsewhere in tech, still a lot of talk about a potential TikTok ban and what that could mean for other companies. You cover Snap and Google who could benefit via YouTube shorts. How likely do you think a TikTok ban is. And who would be the biggest beneficiaries in the space?ANGELO ZINO: So in our view, we still place probably about a 35% probability that happens 35 to 40%. And, you know, the way we would look at it here is probably six to nine months ago, we would have placed less than of 10% chance out there. So the odds are definitely growing. And I think that's why you've kind of seen some improved enthusiasm in a number of these type of social media type names.In terms of the names that would be the biggest beneficiaries, we have pegged Snap as the biggest beneficiary out there, clearly, because they're-- they're probably the smallest player within the space and a name that kind of if you look at who they cater to, very comparable to the TikTok community out there. So it's a name that we think can kind of see significant improvement in DA use and also see some potential incremental addition on the add side of things. So that's the name that we think at least from an immediate perspective would be the biggest beneficiary if you think that's the ultimate outcome.- Great stuff. Angelo Zino, appreciate that. CFRA.]"

311,c0808cf0-792b-3e86-b5ae-84d523866186,DIS,2023-03-31,Roku’s ‘independence’ from TV networks has always given it an advantage: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/roku-independence-tv-networks-always-201714554.html,1680207434,VIDEO,"['DIS', 'ROKU']","[Macquarie Senior Media Tech Analyst Tim Nollen joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Roku's strategy and opportunities, Disney's plans for Hulu, and sports streaming.Video Transcript- Let's take a deep dive into Roku now that the company has announced its second round of layoffs in four months. Joining us now is Tim Nollen, Macquarie senior media tech analyst. Shares fell today, sir, counterintuitive from what we've come to expect. When we get layoffs, usually, we see that share price pop up a little bit because of the cuts. But we're losing 4% on the day. Why?TIM NOLLEN: Well, I don't know. Yeah. You might think that on a cost savings announcement, the stock might rise. Now, Roku has been pretty clear from their earnings in the middle of February that they would be looking to contain costs this year. And they had previously announced job cuts. So I think the balance here is that I think investors recognize that Roku has a lot on its plate.There is a lot that they should be investing in. I mean, this company is facing the operating system wars now, facing up against big competitors like Samsung and like Amazon Fire. And they've got a big international expansion plan, which has a long way to go. They haven't gotten very far with it yet. They also have to make changes into their ad platform and how they serve and deliver ads.So there's a lot of potential upside if Roku can get it right. And maybe the stock is just reflecting the balance between if they're cutting staff versus they need to be working on a lot of things very actively right now. Then where does that put the stock?- Tim, how do you view Roku just as a standalone company here in the future, given the fact that so many of its competitors are bigger than they are right now versus the fact that maybe they could be an attractive acquisition target for some of those larger players?TIM NOLLEN: Well, maybe on the last point I'll just add that Roku-- one of the advantages of Roku is its independence. There is no conflict with other TV network groups or fast services or any of the apps on its interface. Roku does not have a conflict with any of them. If somebody were to acquire Roku, you would immediately have a potential conflict. So the independence that Roku has always been one of its advantages.Story continuesI just think going back to what I was saying before, the company is facing now-- it's a very competitive market. But they've always done well in these competitive markets. I mean, Apple TV and Amazon Fire and Google Chromecast have always been major competitors for Roku's streaming hardware. And they are still the leading connected TV platform in the US despite that.The next trick is, can they expand internationally and do that effectively? So they don't have the brand. They don't have the market position internationally that they've had in the US. They've done well here. They've done well in Canada and Mexico. But there's a long way to go in a lot of countries they haven't yet entered. So I think that's kind of step one.And step two-- don't forget the real business of Roku is advertising. I mean, the devices give Roku the install base upon which they sell advertising through the apps and on the Roku channel to consumers that are on that platform. There are 70 million active accounts on Roku. The real growth is to grow the advertising.That's clearly in a cyclical soft spot right now, advertising is. And Roku, in addition to the cyclical weakness, has to focus really on how to become a more automated advertising business. There's a lot of connected TV advertising money to move over. Roku has to understand how to grab that and how to grow into that.- Is there a logical dance partner, someone that could use their assets?TIM NOLLEN: I won't name names. You named some on the prior segment. There are lots of companies that I suppose might have an interest in Roku. But, again, the independence that Roku offers to everybody using its platform-- I'm talking the companies using its platform-- as one of its advantages.- Tim, let's move over to Disney, another company that you cover here. Lots of questions just about the future of the streaming there at that company, what exactly that looks like. Let's start it off with ESPN. What do you think the fate of ESPN looks like when you take into account some of Disney's future plans with the streaming business?TIM NOLLEN: Yeah. There's a whole lot of bags of worms here in this question, ESPN as well as Hulu. Since Bob Iger came back as CEO of Disney in November, I think there's been-- a lot of new questions have emerged. One is a recurrence of a long-asked question by investors. What will Disney do with ESPN? I think Bob Iger has made pretty clear that ESPN is considered a core franchise within Disney and they want to own it and they want to find a way to convert it into a more active streaming service.Of course, ESPN+ is a streaming service. It does not have the same content as the ESPN linear service. And we've begun to think there might be a couple of catalysts at play here that could accelerate the process of ESPN becoming more a truly OTT service. And that is, one, you've got the NBA rights renewal. That contract is due up at the end of the 2024-25 season. But these contracts usually get done a couple of years in advance.So we don't know. But I believe that the NBA national contract is being discussed right now. And for sure there's got to be a big streaming component to that. In addition, you've got these regional sports networks. Sinclair Broadcasting just went bankrupt, or at least the Diamond Sports component of Sinclair has just gone bankrupt. And that represents half of the NBA and half of the Major League Baseball and half of the National Hockey League games across the country in those regional markets.So there are a lot of legal questions here. There are a lot of logistical and strategic questions here. But we posit the view that what if ESPN+ were to take NBA national streaming rights as well as regional streaming rights, put it into a package, and offer a tier on top of the existing ESPN+ service, offer that out to NBA fans? I believe they could monetize that effectively with streaming subscriptions. Clearly, the advertising that would be supportive of that. And they could support the rights.Doing so I believe could be profit making for them. It would certainly raise the question of what happens to the rest of the linear pay TV bundle if they're going to be moving premium content from the NBA onto ESPN+. But this is the kind of thing that I think is going to happen. I don't know if this exactly happens the way I just described. This is the kind of thing that's going to come to sports streaming in any case. And I think ESPN has a leading position here.- All right. We asked you about some intrigue with Roku. Got to get your thoughts on Needham's Laura Martin, who says Apple would be worth 15% to 25% more if they buy Disney. Could something like that ever happen? How would it impact Disney?TIM NOLLEN: Wow. The M&amp;A questions today. I don't know. I don't want to wade into that specifically. But I would say I believe there is a lot of value in Disney. I believe it is the one traditional media company that has the best chance of transitioning to a streaming world successfully. And they've already done this with Disney+. They still have to shed the old linear business behind. But here's one number for you on ESPN. ESPN pay TV subscribers have fallen from 99 million at the peak to I believe 74 million. That's just the cord cutting, that traditional bundle falling down.ESPN+ has 24 million subscribers. That's almost exactly the same number. It's not apples to apples. The content is different. The pricing is different. But that's an indication of how I think Disney can translate from the old world into the new world. They're already well along the path. And I think there is a lot of value within Disney that's not being appreciated fully in the stock price. And who knows? There might be other companies out there that might see that value as well.- That is plenty of intrigue there. We'll take that, Tim. Appreciate it.]"

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Walt Disney have gained +11.5% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry’s gain of +13.5%. The Zacks analyst believes that Disney is benefiting from the growing popularity of Disney+, owing to a strong content portfolio and a cheaper bundle offering. The strong line-up of movies that includes The Little Mermaid; Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3; Elemental; Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Haunted Mansion bodes well for the Media and Entertainment Distribution segment.Revival in Parks, Experiences and Products businesses is encouraging. Theme Park business is likely to gain from strong demand across both domestic and international parks. However, Disney+’s profitability continues to be negatively impacted by higher programming and production costs across Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu.(You can read the full research report on Walt Disney here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Marathon Petroleum shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry over the past year (+56.8% vs. +8.3%). The Zacks analyst believes that Marathon Petroleum’s sale of its Speedway retail business for $21 billion provided the downstream operator with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement per which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.But while refining fundamentals have certainly brightened from the covid lows, the sector is not out of the woods yet in terms of cash flows that remain anemic and well below the pre-crisis levels. In particular, the weakness in business travel demand remains a complicating factor.Story continues(You can read the full research report on Marathon Petroleum here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Moderna have declined -17.2% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry’s decline of -4.8%. The Zacks analyst believes that lower cases of COVID-19 infections are fueling uncertainty regarding demand for vaccinations, resulting in declining product sales. The launch of COVID vaccines by competitors like Sanofi and Novavax will also likely lead to a loss of product sales.Currently, Moderna is conducting three ongoing late-stage studies evaluating RSV, CMV, and influenza vaccines. However, these candidates are still years away from commercialization. Nonetheless, Moderna expects to record a minimum of around $5.0 billion from COVID vaccine sales in 2023.(You can read the full research report on Moderna here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.

Efforts to boost production capacity through several growth projects will also drive profitability.Robust Ticket Sales Boosts Live Nation's (LYV) ProspectsPer the Zacks analyst, Live Nation is likely to benefit from pent-up demand for live events, solid ticket sales, and sponsorship business.

314,ff4e0b0b-22ec-32c3-9695-be4451747b83,UA,2023-03-31,NBA star Steph Curry extends historic partnership with Under Armour,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nba-star-steph-curry-extends-195428912.html,1680206068,VIDEO,"['UA', 'UAA']","[The Yahoo Finance Live team discusses Under Armour's stock and Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry signing an extension with Under Armour.Video TranscriptDAVE BRIGGS: My play is Under Armour. Today, the Baltimore based apparel brand extending their deal with Warriors star Steph Curry to what's expected to result in one of the richest endorsement deals in sports history and what could amount to a lifetime deal. As part of the agreement, Curry becomes the President of Under Armour's Curry brand, and he'll work on golf, youth sports, sports style, in addition to basketball.The two time MVP, four time NBA champ initially signed with Under Armour in 2013 for around $4 million per year. His current contract is worth a reported $215 million, expires in '24, and includes equity in Under Armour. And that, of course, is the key.Said the founder of Under Armour, Kevin Plank, I couldn't imagine under Armor without Steph, nor Steph without Under Armour. Shares relatively flat today and down 5%-plus this year, 47% over the last 12 months as they try to compete with Nike. There are reports from ""Rolling Stone"" that this is what equates to a $1 billion deal with Steph Curry, but, again, no numbers from Under Armour. And, of course, it depends on what that equity is worth.The real question is, Josh, how much of a difference maker is he? Because, look, Steph Curry, and I'm not afraid to say that he has changed the game of basketball more so than Michael Jordan. And people can get mad at that all they want. He has changed it at every level-- youth, high school, college, the pros.He's changed everything we know about the game fundamentally-- again, more than Magic, more than Jordan. But will the shoes move the needle? We're not going to compare it to the Jordan brand, because they did $5 billion in revenue 25 years after Jordan retired.- The key here is going to be can, they make Steph Curry cool from a lifestyle perspective? I think right now, Steph Curry's shoes are cool to wear on the court and his basketball shoes are pretty popular. But he hasn't had that Jordan effect where once he retires, people don't wear shoes of retired guys on the court anymore. That's not really that cool for kids.Story continuesSo you've got to get to the lifestyle part of it. I think the golf tie-in is pretty cool. Steph Curry is a big golfer. He'll probably have a presence in the golf game post his career. But I don't know, Seana, I was surprised about the amount of athletes that you kind of can't name that are sponsored by Under Armour.And it's not like the Nike group that I think is kind of famous and really drives a lifestyle brand. We were looking them up earlier and some of the names are like, they're sponsored by Under Armour? I didn't remember that.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, they caught us a little bit offguard. We didn't even realize that. That's so true. And I think part of this deal and part of the reason why Under Armour is keeping Steph Curry is also just his ability to attract other very large name, well known athletes that Under Armour is hoping they will be able to come out with their own lines, they will be able to attract that user base.Because look at the numbers, look at their performance over the last several years. The company continues to struggle. We know inventory has been a massive issue for us Under Armour. They have been promoting as much or if not even more than some of their competitors out there. So huge win, I think, for Under Armour-- obviously, with that potential payday makes sense for Steph Curry too.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, it'll be interesting. I think it's a similar question that Adidas faces with arguably the most famous athlete on the planet, which is Messi. Can he translate, can they develop an off the field shoe? Neither have really made much of an effort or had success off the field. That may be the key.- It's just crazy, quickly, when you think about it, if I had told you a decade ago that Under Armour got Steph Curry before the Warriors won all those championships and before he got this big, you would think they'd have a bigger presence in basketball, wouldn't you?DAVE BRIGGS: No question about that.SEANA SMITH: That's true. He's so likable too.- Right. No, Steph Curry is awesome. The Warriors are-- they're fun to watch. And it just hasn't taken off to that level.]"

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Comcast's shares before the 4th of April in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 26th of April.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.29 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.16 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Comcast has a trailing yield of 3.1% on the current share price of $36.95. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Its dividend payout ratio is 89% of profit, which means the company is paying out a majority of its earnings. The relatively limited profit reinvestment could slow the rate of future earnings growth. It could become a concern if earnings started to decline. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Fortunately, it paid out only 38% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see Comcast's earnings per share have dropped 23% a year over the past five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Comcast has delivered 14% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. That's intriguing, but the combination of growing dividends despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out a larger percentage of profits. Comcast is already paying out a high percentage of its income, so without earnings growth, we're doubtful of whether this dividend will grow much in the future.The Bottom LineHas Comcast got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? We're not enthused by the declining earnings per share, although at least the company's payout ratio is within a reasonable range, meaning it may not be at imminent risk of a dividend cut. It might be worth researching if the company is reinvesting in growth projects that could grow earnings and dividends in the future, but for now we're not all that optimistic on its dividend prospects.If you're not too concerned about Comcast's ability to pay dividends, you should still be mindful of some of the other risks that this business faces. For example - Comcast has 3 warning signs we think you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Devon Energy (DVN) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Devon Energy currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 20 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy.Of the 20 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy, representing 50% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for DVNBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for DVNCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Devon Energy here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Devon Energy, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is DVN a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Devon Energy, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 9.6% over the past month to $6.66.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Devon Energy. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Devon Energy with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This has lagged the Construction sector's loss of 1.53% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.72% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from United Rentals as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect United Rentals to post earnings of $8.01 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 39.79%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.09 billion, up 22.33% from the prior-year quarter.URI's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $41.92 per share and revenue of $14 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +28.98% and +20.25%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for United Rentals should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

If you want to see more cheap quarterly dividend stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to Buy.Quarterly dividend stocks are stocks that pay dividends each quarter.Companies pay dividends as a way to return excess capital back to shareholders. If a company's profit increases substantially, many companies will increase their dividend in good times. In more challenging or difficult times, company profits could decline or go negative and many companies will cut or suspend their dividends.Cheap stocks are stocks that trade for below what they normally would be worth for various reasons. Given what is an attractive valuation can change depending on a stock's specifics, sector fundamentals, and broader economic factors that change all the time, there isn't a single indicator such as forward P/E that tells whether a stock is cheap or not.Instead, the best cheap stocks to buy are arguably blue chip stocks with substantial competitive advantages and also growth potential that are trading for fair or low valuations. Blue chips are established companies with competitive advantages that are well known and generally are pretty profitable. For those of you interested, check out 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Given the recent failure of Silicon Valley Bank and several other banks, the stock prices of many leading blue chip stocks in financial sector have declined. As a result, some leading financial blue chip stocks that are the leaders in their sectors could be trading at attractive valuations in the long term if economic conditions normalize. Financial stocks may have near term downside risk, however, if more banks fail or if the economy slows more than expected.For some companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), the stocks trade for higher forward P/E ratios but are still nevertheless considered cheap given their growth potential due to the growth of AI.Story continuesAccording to Goldman Sachs, generative AI could eventually increase annual global GDP by 7% at some point in the future with productivity increases.If AI continues to improve, AI could potentially increase the production and services significantly further in the long term.As a result of AI's potential, demand for semiconductors which are needed to power AI will likely increase and essential semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) which is at least several years ahead of its competition will likely benefit from the increases in demand.

But for most major stock and bond investments beyond the banking sector itself, the quarter remained a pretty upbeat one overall.As the Federal Reserve's emergency lending to banks stabilised at high levels in the week to Wednesday, Fed officials appear to have reverted to 'wait and see' mode on further interest rate rises and will weigh up a final quarter point hike now meeting to meeting.While all seem to chime with the view that a hit to lending from the regional bank disturbance may now do some of the Fed's job for it, they remain uncomfortable about inflation. ""Inflation remains too high and recent indicators reinforce my view that there is more work to do,"" said Boston Fed chief Susan Collins.Although somewhat dated now given this month's events, Friday sees a February update for the Fed's favoured PCE measure of inflation - the annual core rate that is expected to have stuck last month at 4.7% and more than twice the Fed target.Heavy hitters from the Fed's board and policymaking council are also on the speech trail later in the day. Futures markets are still broadly split on the chances of another Fed hike in May, but leaned a bit more on Friday to one more quarter point move.Beyond America, a picture of slowly ebbing but sticky inflation was also in evidence.Flash euro zone inflation for March surprised with a larger-than-expected 1.6 percentage point drop during the month and fell below 7% for the first time in a year. But core inflation, excluding energy and unprocessed food, ticked up as forecast to a new record high for the bloc at 7.5%.Story continuesBut - like much else in the macro economy at the moment - the data picture remains fuzzy around the world.Germany said import price inflation fell to its lowest in two years at 2.8% in February. Core inflation in Tokyo slowed in for the second month in a row in March to 3.2%, even though higher than forecast and still above Bank of Japan targets.Britain's house prices fell at an annual rate of 3.1% this month - the fastest drop since the real estate and banking crash 14 years ago.And the latest business surveys from China cast some doubts on the speed of the manufacturing recovery there.Broadly speaking, financial markets were steady on Friday. Two-year Treasury yields briefly hit a one-week high of 4.168% before slipping back and Treasury volatility ebbed to its lowest since March 13. Asia and Europe stock indices were steady to higher and Wall St futures were likewise.The dollar is ending a relatively quiet quarter on the front foot and rose on Friday.In politics, attention was on the expected court appearance next week of former U.S. President Donald Trump- still frontrunner to be Republican nominee for the 2024 election - after he was indicted over a probe into hush money paid to a porn star. Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Friday: * U.S. Feb personal spending/income and PCE inflation gauge, March Chicago business survey; University of Michigan final March reading on consumer sentiment; Canada Jan GDP * New York Federal Reserve President John Williams, Fed Board Governor Chris Waller and Fed Board Governor Lisa Cook all speak; European Central Bank President Christina Lagarde speaks(By Mike Dolan, editing by XXXX mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

""And from Micron's read, we're not.On Wednesday, Infineon boosted its outlook for both its second quarter and full-year, crediting resilience in the auto and industrials divisions, while Intel said its previously delayed Sierra Forest semiconductor that focuses on power efficiency would be delivered in the first half of next year.""There's been a chip glut through the industry so production has been very low, prices have had to come down,"" said Jeff Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab in Celebration, Florida.""Semiconductor businesses are very sensitive to the inventory cycle.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Cheap Beginner Stocks to Buy.Morgan Stanley's Big Bear: ""It's Just A Much Less Predictable World""On March 27 Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist, Mike Wilson, gave an interview to Bloomberg where he discussed his view of the markets right now. Wilson noted that the bond market is not moving in coherence with the Fed, and he thinks the equities market will follow this trajectory. Here are some comments from Mike Wilson:""It's just a much less predictable world, and this has been our theme for the last couple of years, that we're entering a period of economic volatility. The last 20 years has been a world of repression where all of these metrics were somewhat predictable, and that's for companies, that's for the Fed itself, that's for investors. And now we're entering a world when it's just not as predictable, and that means higher risk premiums. Whether we're talking about credit, whether we're talking about term premium in the bond market, or we're talking about equity risk premium. In our view, I think people are operating as if we're gonna go back to that predictable world and that's, I think, misplaced.""Mike Wilson said that the degradation in multiples that stocks had last year was due to higher interest rates and not higher risk premiums. According to Wilson, the market has started to ""revalue, or devalue, the companies that are most at risk of missing estimates"". The companies that are expected to come under pressure in a high interest rate environment and are most at risk of missing estimates, according to Wilson, include small-cap, lower quality, and cyclical companies.Moreover, Mike Wilson pointed out that tech companies experienced significant declines in their stock prices last year due to their high valuations and sensitivity to rising interest rates. While these companies have cut costs, which has led to them rallying, Wilson believes that there are still risks associated with investing in them especially given the potential for further cost pressures.Story continuesThere are some areas within the market that Mike Wilson thinks have repriced and are presenting an opportunity. The financials segment has ""repriced in a meaningful way"", said Wilson. Moreover, some consumer-focused businesses and the retail segment have also repriced. Mike Wilson thinks there are opportunities in individual stocks, as opposed to indices, which do not look as attractive to him at this point in time.Finally, Mike Wilson thinks that valuations will reset over the next two quarters. However, he also said that he does not think stock valuations will stay low for long, and this is not a ""secular structural bear market"", it is actually a ""cyclical bear market"" and there is enough liquidity to stabilize things.The markets are extremely volatile and uncertain right now, given sticky inflation and a hawkish Fed. In times like these, retail investors can feel overwhelmed when it comes to investing in the stock market. However, looking at where institutional investors are parking cash can be insightful, as they have the resources and expertise to make sensical investment decisions.

Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy. For the first three quarters of the year, we should change the name of our fund to the Jed Clampett Fund. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), was one of the standouts.

In particular, shares of Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) were pressured by its recently announced multiyear capex plan to accelerate network upgrades. While this reduces free cash flow available for buybacks in the medium term, it sustains the company’s competitive advantage and should accelerate long term growth. The company also has ambitious goals to expand its footprint into adjacent and rural markets, taking advantage of the federal and state broadband subsidies.

Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”12. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)11. Biogen Inc.

Cigna Healthcare provides health insurance products, including a business in which Cigna provides administrative services only to plan sponsors (employers, unions, and other groups). Evernorth provides a portfolio of health care services, including pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services, care delivery services, data and analytics solutions, and distribution of specialty drugs. Each segment has a portion of business that provides steady, predictable growth. These foundational businesses, which account for roughly 60% of total revenue, include the U.S. commercial business, the PBM business, and international. The other 40% of revenue comes from higher-growth businesses, including the specialty pharmacy business, care delivery services, and Medicare Advantage. Management targets 10% to 13% annual EPS growth over the long term. The stock trades at a significant discount to industry peers because of the company’s commercial health insurance and PBM business mix. We think the PBM business will benefit from the biosimilar wave in the next few years, and as Cigna’s higher growth businesses become a bigger percentage of the overall mix, we think the stock can appreciate at least in line with its annual EPS growth with potential for valuation expansion.”8.

Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered fiscal second quarter revenue within our guidance range, and excluding the impact of inventory write-downs, margins and EPS were also within the guidance range. The semiconductor memory and storage industry is facing its worst downturn in the last 13 years with an exceptionally weak pricing environment that is significantly impacting our financial performance. We have taken substantial supply reduction and austerity measures, including executing a company-wide reduction in force. We now believe that customer inventories have reduced in several end markets, and we see gradually improving supply-demand balance in the months ahead. Excluding the impact of inventory write-downs, we believe our balance sheet DIO has peaked in fiscal Q2, and we are close to our transition to sequential revenue growth in our quarterly results.We are navigating the near-term difficult environment with our strong technology position, deep manufacturing expertise, strengthening product portfolio, solid balance sheet and incredibly talented team. Beyond this downturn, we anticipate a return to normalized growth and profitability in line with our long-term financial model. Micron continues to lead the industry in both DRAM and NAND technology. We are investing prudently to maintain our technology competitiveness while managing node ramps to reduce our bit supply and align it with demand. In DRAM, 1-alpha represents most of our DRAM bit production, and we continue to make great progress in initiating our transition to 1-beta. In NAND, 176-layer and 232-layer now represent more than 90% of NAND bit production.We also continue to lead the industry in QLC. QLC accounted for over 20% of our NAND bit production and shipments in fiscal Q2. The Micron team's solid execution and implementation of smart manufacturing has driven superb yield enhancement across our leading-edge nodes. Yields on 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND have reached levels that are now higher than any node in our history. In addition, both our 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND have reached targeted yields ahead of schedule and faster than any of our prior nodes. We are well positioned to qualify these leading-edge nodes across our product portfolio and will ramp them based on customer demand. We are also making good progress towards the introduction of our EUV-based 1-gamma node in 2025.Similar to our 1-alpha and 1-beta nodes, we expect this node to provide us with competitive performance, power, cost and density improvements. Now turning to our end markets. As a result of inventory adjustments across our end markets, slowing demand growth and an extremely challenging pricing environment, revenue was down year-over-year in all end markets. While our industry faces significant near-term challenges, we believe that the memory and storage TAM will grow to a new record in calendar 2025 and will continue to outpace the growth of the semiconductor industry thereafter. Recent developments in AI provides an exciting prelude to the transformational capabilities of large language models, or LLMs, such as ChatGPT, which requires significant amounts of memory and storage to operate.We are only in the very early stages of the void split deployment of these AI technologies and potential exponential growth in their commercial use cases. As more applications of this technology proliferate, we will see training workloads in the data center supplemented with voice spread influence capabilities in the data center as well as in end user devices, all of which will drive significant growth in memory and storage consumption. In data center, we believe that our revenue bottomed in fiscal Q2, and we expect to see revenue growth in fiscal Q3. Data center customer inventories should reach relatively healthy levels by the end of calendar 2023. We continue to see AI as a secular driver of demand growth in the data center. An AI server today can have as much as 8x the DRAM content of a regular server and up to 3x the NAND content.We are well positioned to capture the memory and storage opportunities that AI and data-centric computing architectures will provide. Our product roadmap includes exciting HBM3 and CXL innovations, and I look forward to sharing more details about these solutions in the future. In fiscal Q2, we expanded shipments of CXL DRAM samples to OEM customers that service enterprise, cloud and HPC workloads. Micron is leading the industry with world-class DDR5, or D5 technology. We are shipping D5 in high volume to data center customers and achieved our first customer qualification for our 1-alpha 24-gigabit D5 product. The latest generation of server processors, AMD's Genoa and Intel's Sapphire Rapids, require D5 DRAM. Servers using these new processes will drive higher D5 industry bit demand in second half of calendar 2023, towards mix crossover with D4 in mid-calendar 2024.In fiscal Q2, we also began volume production and shipments of the fastest PCIe Gen4x4 NVMe SSD in the market, our 9400 176-layer performance NVMe data center SSD, which excels in AI and high-performance computing workloads. In PCs, we now forecast calendar 2023 PC unit volume to decline by mid-single-digit percentage, returning PC unit volume to pre-COVID levels last seen in 2019. Although still elevated, client customer inventories have improved meaningfully, and we expect increased bit demand in the second half of the fiscal year. With our strong product lineup, we are well positioned for the ongoing industry transition to D5. Client's D5 adoption is expected to gradually increase through calendar 2023, with D4 to D5 mix crossover in early to mid-calendar 2024.In fiscal Q2, our NAND QLC bit shipment mix reached a new record for the second consecutive quarter, driven by growth in both client and consumer SSDs. We qualified our Micron 2400 SSD, the world's only 176-layer QLC SSD qualified at OEMs, across the client customer base. In graphics, industry analysts continue to expect graphics TAM growth CAGR to outpace the broader market supported by applications across client and data center. Customers' inventory adjustments are progressing well, and we expect demand in the calendar second half of 2023 to be stronger than the first half. As the performance leader in graphics, we are excited to see our proprietary 16-gigabit G6X featured in the recently launched NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti. In mobile, we now expect calendar 2023 smartphone unit volume to be down slightly year-over-year.While some customer inventories are back to normal levels, other OEMs' inventories remain elevated. In aggregate, we expect mobile customer inventory to improve through the remainder of calendar 2023, and we expect growth in mobile DRAM and NAND bit shipments in the second half of our fiscal year versus the first half. In fiscal Q2, we continued sampling and qualifying our industry-leading 1-beta 16-gigabit LP5X, receiving very positive feedback on its power, performance and quality from customers. We expect to generate revenue on this 1-beta product later this fiscal year. We showcased our leading products earlier this month at Mobile World Congress, where we displayed 8 flagship mobile customer design wins. Last, I'll cover the auto and industrial end markets, which now represent over 20% of our revenue and contribute more stable revenue and profitability.Micron is the market share leader in these important and fast-growing markets. In fiscal Q2, auto revenue grew approximately 5% year-over-year. Our leadership in automotive was evidenced by several milestones in Q2. We reached a new record customer quality score, qualified the industry's first 176-layer e.MMC 5.1 automotive product, and began shipping the industry's first 176-layer UFS 3.1 automotive solution. We expect continued growth in auto memory demand for the second half of calendar 2023, driven by gradually easing nonmemory supply constraints and increasing memory content per vehicle. The industrial market continued to soften in Q2, as our distribution channel partners reduce their inventory levels and end demand weakened for some customers.Computer, memory, processorPhoto by Liam Briese on UnsplashInventories are starting to stabilize at the majority of our customers, and we expect demand to improve in the second half of our fiscal year. In our fiscal second quarter, Micron achieved advanced startup sampling and design-in across automation OEMs, ODMs and integrators with our latest generation of products. Now turning to our market outlook. Our expectations for calendar 2023 industry bit demand growth have moderated to approximately 5% in DRAM and low-teens percentage range in NAND, which are well below the expected long-term CAGR of mid-teens percentage range in DRAM and low-20s percentage range in NAND. The reduction in calendar 2023 demand from our prior forecast is driven by an assessment of customer inventories as well as some degradation in end market demand.We expect that improving customer inventories will support sequential bit demand growth for DRAM and NAND through the calendar year. China's reopening is also a positive factor for calendar 2023 bit demand. Public reports indicate that there have been significant CapEx cuts throughout the industry, and utilization rates have declined at all DRAM and NAND suppliers. We now expect that the industry bit supply growth for DRAM and NAND in calendar 2023 will be below demand growth, which will help improve supplier inventories. While the supply-demand balance is expected to gradually improve due to the high levels of inventories, industry profitability and free cash flow are likely to remain extremely challenged in the near term. Market recovery can accelerate if there is a year-to-year reduction in production or, in other words, negative DRAM and NAND industry bit supply growth in 2023.In response to the industry environment, Micron has taken a number of decisive actions in fiscal 2023. First, we are further reducing our supply. We have made additional reductions to our fiscal 2023 CapEx plan and now expect to invest approximately $7 billion, down more than 40% from last year, with WFE down more than 50%. In fiscal 2024, we expect WFE to fall further as we ramp 1-beta and 232-layer nodes in a capital-efficient manner. We have further reduced DRAM and NAND wafer starts, which are now down by approximately 25%. As a result, for calendar 2023, we now expect Micron's year-on-year bit supply growth to be meaningfully negative for DRAM. We also expect to produce fewer NAND bits in calendar 2023 than in calendar 2022. Excluding the impact of inventory write-downs, we expect Micron's DIO to decline sequentially going forward from its peak in the second quarter.Second, we have made further reductions to our operating expenses beyond the executive salary cuts and suspension of Micron's fiscal 2023 bonuses company-wide. We now expect our overall headcount reduction to approach 15%. This will occur through a combination of workforce reductions, which are now largely complete as well as anticipated attrition through the remainder of the year. Third, Micron continues to execute to a strategy of maintaining flat annual bit share in both DRAM and NAND. While we have had to reduce price to remain competitive in the market, we have not done so in an attempt to gain share. As such, share changes at customers are generally transitory. Lastly, we have taken additional steps to ensure ample liquidity. Mark will go into further detail.Micron continues to have the strongest balance sheet among the pure-play memory and storage companies, and our strong liquidity will enable us to weather this downturn while ensuring our product and technology competitiveness. I will now turn it over to Mark.Mark Murphy: Thanks, Sanjay. Fiscal Q2 results reflected challenging market conditions with continued deterioration in pricing and profitability. Total fiscal Q2 revenue was approximately $3.7 billion, down 10% sequentially and 53% year-over-year. Fiscal Q2 revenue included $114 million from an insurance settlement disclosed at the time we provided guidance. Fiscal Q2 DRAM revenue was $2.7 billion, representing 74% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 4% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the mid-teens percentage range and prices declining by approximately 20%. Fiscal Q2 DRAM bit shipments benefited from the timing of shipments between fiscal Q1 and fiscal Q2. Fiscal Q2 NAND revenue was $885 million, representing 24% of Micron's total revenue.NAND revenue declined 20% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the mid- to high-single-digit percentage range and prices declining in the mid-20s percentage range. Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit revenue was $1.4 billion, down 21% sequentially. And on a sequential basis, cloud revenue was down while client revenue was stable. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $945 million, up 44% sequentially. Mobile revenue benefited from the timing of some shipments between fiscal Q1 and fiscal Q2. Embedded Business Unit revenue was $865 million, down 14% sequentially. On a sequential basis, automotive markets were relatively stable following industrial and consumer end markets experienced weakness.Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $507 million, down 25% sequentially and impacted by challenging conditions in the NAND market. Consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q2 was negative 31.4%. This result was negatively impacted by approximately $1.4 billion or 38.7 percentage points of inventory write-down recorded in the quarter. These noncash write-downs, which lower the cost basis of inventory, resulted -- results from projected selling prices falling below the cost of inventory and are not the result of obsolescence. Operating expenses in fiscal Q2 were $916 million, down roughly $80 million sequentially. We continue to aggressively manage our operating expenses and expect them to decline sequentially in both fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4.We had an operating loss of roughly $2.1 billion in fiscal Q2, resulting in an operating margin of negative 56%, down from negative 2% in the prior quarter and positive 35% in the prior year. The operating loss included the $1.4 billion inventory write-down recorded in the quarter for a 39 percentage point impact to operating margin. Fiscal Q2 taxes were $53 million. As mentioned in previous quarters, despite a consolidated loss on a worldwide basis, we still have taxes payable in certain geographies due to taxable income levels reported in those geographies. Non-GAAP loss per share in fiscal Q2 was $1.91, down from a loss per share of $0.04 in the prior quarter and earnings per share of $2.14 in the prior year. Fiscal Q2 EPS included approximately $1.34 of losses from the impact of the inventory write-down.Turning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated $343 million in cash from operations in fiscal Q2, representing approximately 9% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $2.2 billion during the quarter. We expect fiscal 2023 CapEx to be 2/3 front-half weighted, with a higher mix of construction spend in the second half. Free cash flow was negative $1.8 billion in the quarter. Our ending fiscal Q2 inventory was $8.1 billion and reflects the impact of the $1.4 billion write-down. Average days of inventory for the quarter was 153 days, and excluding write-downs, 235 days. Inventory levels and days are higher in NAND than DRAM. Our actions on supply reflect our intent to work down days of inventories from these levels. At quarter end, we held cash and investments of $12.1 billion and had total liquidity of $14.6 billion when considering our untapped credit facility.Given macroeconomic uncertainty and the market environment, during the quarter, we bolstered our liquidity further through the addition of $1.9 billion of long-term debt. Our fiscal Q2 ending debt was $12.3 billion. Under a net debt position, our net interest income moves to net interest expense in Q3. Micron's balance sheet is solid with ample liquidity, low net debt and a weighted average maturity on debt of December 2029. Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal third quarter. Market conditions remain extremely challenging. However, we expect that for the rest of this calendar year, DRAM and NAND bit shipments will continue to increase and supply-demand balance will gradually improve. Included in the fiscal third quarter guide is an insurance recovery, separate and unrelated to that recognized in fiscal Q2 of approximately $110 million, $70 million of which we expect to recognize as revenue.In fiscal Q3, we expect gross margins to be negatively impacted by pricing, write-down of inventory, cost of underutilization and a higher mix of NAND. On write-down of inventory, our guidance assumes a write-down of approximately $500 million associated with inventory produced during fiscal Q3. Small changes to price expectations beyond fiscal Q3 could have a substantial positive or negative impact to the inventory write-down amount in fiscal Q3. Potential variances of inventory write-downs are not factored into the guidance ranges for gross margin and EPS. As market conditions remain weak, we will continue to aggressively manage our expense profile. As Sanjay mentioned, we increased our headcount reduction target to approach 15% from our previous target of approximately 10%.We now expect OpEx to fall below $850 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. For nonoperating items, we expect net interest expense of approximately $5 million in fiscal Q3. We now project fiscal 2023 taxes to be less than $140 million. We expect profitability to remain extremely challenged in the near term. We do project profitability to improve sequentially due to lower inventory write-downs and free cash flow to improve slightly, driven by reduced capital spend. But we forecast operating margin and free cash flow to remain significantly negative through the fiscal year. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal Q3 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $3.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of negative 21%, plus or minus 250 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $900 million, plus or minus $15 million.We expect tax expense of approximately $50 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.09 billion shares, we expect EPS to be a loss of $1.58, plus or minus $0.07. In closing, we continue to aggressively manage through this period of challenging market conditions, preserving our competitive technology and product positions, strong operational capability and solid balance sheet. Following this downturn, we expect to capitalize on the secular demand trends and growth in memory and storage. We believe we are close to a transition to sequential revenue growth in our quarterly results. We are focused on significantly improving profitability and returning to positive quarterly free cash flow within fiscal 2024. We remain confident in our financial model, and we'll continue to operate the business in a disciplined manner to generate long-term profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns.Sanjay Mehrotra: Thank you, Mark. We are carefully managing our business to weather this industry downturn, preserving our technology and product portfolio competitiveness and manufacturing capabilities. Micron is the leader in DRAM and NAND process technology and one of only a handful of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturers in the world. Our team continues to drive new breakthroughs for our customers. Memory and storage are at the heart of systems and solutions that fuel the global economic engine, drive new efficiencies, create higher productivity and spud advances that make life better for people around the world. We look forward to a normalization of market conditions, and we remain confident in the long-term demand for our solutions based on the value they create across multiple end markets.

That single transaction was for US$158k worth of shares at a price of US$68.72 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$51.47). It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.While Fidelity National Information Services insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Fidelity National Information Services Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last quarter, Fidelity National Information Services insiders have spent a meaningful amount on shares. Not only was there no selling that we can see, but they collectively bought US$1.4m worth of shares. This is a positive in our book as it implies some confidence.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that Fidelity National Information Services insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$85m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Do The Fidelity National Information Services Insider Transactions Indicate?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchases. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. But on the other hand, the company made a loss during the last year, which makes us a little cautious. Insiders likely see value in Fidelity National Information Services shares, given these transactions (along with notable insider ownership of the company). So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

345,9c999788-9982-354a-a9dc-caaf4eb86bf2,YUM,2023-03-31,Yum Brands: A Compound Growth Prospect,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yum-brands-compound-growth-prospect-205937836.html,1680123577,STORY,['YUM'],"[Yum Brands Inc. (NYSE:YUM) is a hot topic of conversation as the company continues to impress with robust financial results and generous shareholder compensation. The stock has been subject to much praise on Wall Street, and key metrics corroborate the bullish outlook of the asset.In an attempt to draw my own consensus about Yum Brands, I decided to juxtapose key influencing variables. I subsequently discovered that the stock might follow a favorable trajectory in the coming years.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with YUM. Click here to check it out. YUM 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of YUMPeter Lynch Chart of YUMHeadline earnings reviewYum Brands released its fourth-quarter earnings report last month, revealing an earnings beat of five cents per share. Based on the company's pro forma report, it delivered an 8% year-over-year increase in entity-wide sales, with its KFC and TacoBell units exhibiting sales growth of 6% and 14% apiece.Furthermore, the company's latest results conveyed share buybacks worth $4.1 million at an average cost of $119 per share. With the average buyback price in mind, the company's open market repurchases lowered the cost basis of its existing shareholders, illustrating Yum Brands' shareholder-driven ethos.Lastly, Yum Brands CEO David Gibbs commented on the company's quarterly and fiscal results, saying:""2022 was a landmark year for Yum as we beat our own industry record for unit development, opening an incredible 4,560 gross new units. Despite a challenging environment, we achieved widespread system sales growth of 8%, excluding Russia with $24 billion in digital sales, demonstrating that our iconic brands are more relevant, easy, and distinctive than ever. I am confident that our distinct competitive advantages, including our world-class franchisees and the industry's best talent, will drive accelerated growth in the future.""Fundamental analysisA reduced form analysis of Yum Brands suggests the company's business and stock alike are in splendid condition. For instance, a recent sector-based survey by Citigroup and UBS concluded the restaurant industry is in top shape, with leading companies like Yum Brands displaying excellent balance sheets, driven by unit economics, market share and brand strength.Story continuesA narrowed-down analysis of Yum Brands highlights a few interesting factors that might play a big hand in investors' investment decisions. A closer look at the income statement shows most of its businesses passed down inflation costs to consumers during 2022's challenging economic environment as its KFC and TacoBell segments achieved positive bottom-line growth.YumBrands' Pizza Hut was unable to pass down 3% of its core input cost rises to consumers. However, a lower inflationary environment in 2023, coupled with persistent demand for strong brands, will likely reverse the segment's fortunes.Yum Brands: A Compound Growth ProspectSource: Yum BrandsFurthermore, Yum's Habit Burger units might soon add to the company's embedded growth. The division experienced a 12% increase in year-over-year sales in 2022. In addition, four new Habit Burger restaurants were added to the portfolio in 2022. In isolation, Yum Brands' Habit Burger units provide lucrative financial benefits; however, the real attraction is linked to the future synergies the chain could bring to its broad-based business model.A final factor to consider is Yum Brands' internally generated cash. The company possesses $1.43 billion in cash from operations, which is critical in today's unfavorable interest rate environment as it allows Yum to resume its acquisition-based business while its smaller competitors might stagnate due to the scarcity of debt.In my opinion, and based on Yum Brands' ongoing results, it can be concluded that the company continues to impress, lending analysts a reasonable basis to upgrade its long-term outlook in tandem with that of the restaurant industry.Wall Street shares a uniform outlookWall Street analysts often disagree about the prospects of an asset. However, there is a uniform outlook for Yum Brands. For example, Bernstein recently dubbed it as the ""LeBron"" of quick-service restaurants, claiming that ""YUM's secret sauce was to combine its strong structural capabilities with a well-crafted marketing positioning that capitalized on the Barbell effect, that sees low-income consumers chasing value and high-income consumers craving for more premium options.""Furthermore, Morgan Stanley believes Yum Brands is in the upper echelon of stocks to own for long-term investors. A recent note by the banking giant stated that its ""brand positioning, menu and store footprints are in better shape, and digital channels are built out, helping KFC and PH compete in any economic environment and any country.""Based on the examples provided and my anecdotal opinion, Wall Street analysts love Yum Brands' stock for two reasons. First, Yum Brands is a moat stock, meaning its business model is largely uncontested, translating into significant profitability. Second, Yum Brands is a countercyclical stock, meaning it possesses the necessary traits to outperform the market throughout the macroeconomic cycle.Valuation and dividendsYum Brands' stock presents lucrative total return prospects. Apart from the fact its forward price-earnings ratio is priced more favorably than its current price-earnings multiple, the company pays its shareholders a compelling dividend.Yum Brands: A Compound Growth ProspectUpon releasing its fourth-quarter results, Yum Brands' management increased its dividend policy rate by 6.1%, resulting in a now 1.87% forward dividend yield for the stock. Moreover, the company's dividends have grown by a compound annual rate of 10.7% over the past three years.In essence, Yum Brands is a low-risk stock that presents consistent returns. Additionally, the company's sustainable dividend growth policy allows investors to benefit from a favorable dividend yield on cost.Final wordA fundamental overview of Yum Brands suggests its stock is in great shape. Most of its businesses were able to pass along input costs during 2022 to preserve their bottom-line growth, which could widen when inflationary pressure eventually subsides.Furthermore, various qualitative features, namely Wall Street consensus and industry surveys, indicate Yum Brands is in terrific shape.Lastly, Yum Brands' most recent share repurchase program and its considerate dividend policy illustrate the company's dedication to its shareholders. Moreover, relative price multiples imply the stock is undervalued.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The new restructuring is expected to be considerably completed by the end of the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023.This particular action will cost Seagate total pre-tax charges between $55 million and $65 million. This includes cash expenditures between $25 million and $30 million for employee termination costs, and other related exit costs between $5 million and $10 million, along with non-cash charges of nearly $25 million.Seagate noted that the layoffs will be executed across multiple functions and geographic locations. There will also be some workforce trimming in the company’s Lyve Edge-to-Cloud Mass Storage Platform business unit to reduce Lyve Cloud investment levels in the near-term.Seagate expects additional restructuring to add further cost savings and help it to deal effectively with the existing weak macroeconomic environment.

Rowe Snapped Up European Bank Debt at Discount in Monday Rout“Some sense of stability has been returning to the banking sector,” said Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital in a phone interview Wednesday. “The regulators have taken the right steps and they can double down on that.”Story continuesAmoroso predicts that spreads could tighten by 50 basis points in the debt of well capitalized, systemically-important banks, recouping losses caused by the turmoil from US regional bank failures. She also likes the debt of large European lenders due to higher liquidity coverage ratios than US peers.Voya’s Wilson is waiting for smaller US lenders to issue new bonds after quarterly earnings. That will provide a fresh look at riskier lenders’ financial health, while also helping to satisfy demand for bank debt after a disappointing first quarter for issuance.Until then, he is steering clear of lower-quality regional lenders that could still be vulnerable to knock on effects from recent bank failures. Lending conditions are expected to materially tighten, particularly for smaller financial firms.“You are going to see many more banks, especially the small banks, playing defense,” he said.Voya, which was underweight regional bank debt heading into the crisis, is also taking advantage of recent spread widening to add some exposure to subordinated debt.AT1 CautioniCapital’s Amoroso sees opportunities to add exposure to preferred bank shares via an index or exchange-traded fund.

Year-to-date, the index is down 1.67% and returned 11.49% in the past six months, as of March 29. Some important Dow companies include Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).The companies that make up the DJIA are leaders in their respective industries and are considered to be representative of the overall performance of the U.S. stock market. The DJIA is often used as a benchmark for the performance of the U.S. stock market as a whole, and investors and analysts use it to track the performance of individual companies and to make investment decisions. The index has shown strong performance over the past years relative to its counterpart, the S&amp;P 500. According to a report by Forbes, the index delivered an average annual return of 16.65% in three years that ended in 2019, compared with a 14.03% annualized return on the S&amp;P 500. In our previous article, we shed light on the performance of both indexes and reported that the Dow has outperformed the wider market over the last 30 years that ended June 2021. During this period, the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 10.6% return, compared with an 11.16% return of the DJIA.In the current market situation, dividend stocks are gaining a lot of traction among investors as they try to generate stable and regular income. When it comes to dividend investing, companies that have proven dividend growth track records become popular because of their strong cash flow generation and solid balance sheets. Dividend growers also dominate the market, especially during periods of high turbulence. A report by Capital Group revealed the importance of dividend stocks and mentioned that they accounted for nearly one-third of the market’s total return from 1926 to 2021. The report also mentioned that dividend growers returned 9.3% to shareholders from 1990 to 2022, with a 14.5% volatility. In comparison, non-dividend payers delivered a 4% return during the same period, with a volatility of 19.7%.

However, for this list, we selected companies from the index that are popular among elite funds. We analyzed Insider Monkey's database of Q4 2022 for measuring hedge fund sentiment around each stock.Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds11. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is an Oregon-based multinational footwear manufacturing company that also manufactures apparel, equipment, and other related accessories. In fiscal Q3 2022, the company posted revenue of $12.4 billion, which showed a 14% growth from the same period last year. During the quarter, the company paid $528 million to shareholders in dividends, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are some other popular dividend stocks in DJIA.Following the company's recent quarterly earnings, Morgan Stanley maintained an Overweight rating on NIKE, Inc.

These stakes have a collective value of over $4 billion.RiverPark Advisors mentioned NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares were a top contributor for 4Q as the company reported solid 2Q23 results and raised its annual guidance. Nike reported 17% revenue growth (27% on a currency neutral basis) and $0.85 EPS, both significantly greater than expectations. Management raised its F23 outlook to low teens currency-neutral revenue growth.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect gross and operating margin improvements as it shifts its product mix to more premium products and adopts a more direct to consumer approach, driving long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”10. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an American financial services company that specializes in payment cards. The company raised its quarterly dividend by 15% on March 9 to $0.60 per share. It has been making regular dividend payments to shareholders for the past 30 years.

The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74An American multinational consumer goods corporation, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”8. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a New York-based multinational investment banking company that also provides other financial services to its consumers. The company is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as it returned over $3.2 billion to shareholders in dividends.The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

(NYSE:GS), up from 69 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is roughly $5 billion.Here is what Manole Capital Management had to say about The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)7. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is an American multinational pharmaceutical company, based in New Jersey.

(NYSE:MRK), with a total value of over $5 billion. Citadel Investment Group was the company's largest shareholder in Q4.Artisan Partners mentioned Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a provider of health care solutions including prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, animal health and consumer care products. Shares have benefited from investors seeking safety in areas with less economic and interest rate sensitivity. With about one third of its sales generated by blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, the key issue for investors is the success of its large R&amp;D pipeline to replace those sales when Keytruda comes off patent in 2028. However, Merck seems to be getting little credit from investors for the 60+ programs it has in clinical development, despite having several solid and large new product opportunities. Additionally, the company’s strong balance sheet and robust free cash flow provide it multiple options for future partnerships and acquisitions, besides return of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.”6.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Hershey Company HSY, General Mills, Inc. GIS, Mondelez International, Inc. MDLZ and Vital Farms, Inc. VITL.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Stocks to Buy on Rebound in Consumer ConfidenceAmericans seem more optimistic for the first time in months despite the recent turmoil in the banking sector and the Fed’s continuation of the interest rate hike. Inflation is still at multi-year highs, and consumers believe that the situation is unlikely to change over the next year.However, they are confident about the underlying strength in the economy, which is likely to save it from slipping into a recession as the Fed will finally manage to bring inflation down. Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in defensive sector stocks such as consumer staples.Consumer Confidence Rises in MarchThe Conference Board said on Mar 28 that the Consumer Confidence Index rose to 104.2 in March from an upwardly revised 103.4 in February. The unexpected jump in March also came in above the consensus estimate of a reading of 101.The solid rebound comes despite the recent turmoil in the banking sector that triggered a massive selloff in financial stocks following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Corporation. Since then, things have become worse with the bank's collapse and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation taking over the management of the banks.However, consumers are still confident. The consumer confidence survey showed that an increasing number of people are planning to buy automobiles and household consumer durables like refrigerators, television sets, vacuum cleaners and washing machines over the next six months.Story continuesThe increase in consumer confidence for the upcoming six months helped the headline index for March. The Expectations Index improved to 73 in March from 70.4 in February. However, the Present Situation Index fell to 151.1 from 153 in the previous month.The 12-month inflation expectations of consumers increased from 6.2% to 6.3% in March. This came as the Fed increased interest rates by another 25 basis points in March, and officials said earlier in the month that the central bank will have to continue raising interest rates for a longer time than expected in order to fight soaring inflation.Investors, however, have been feeling confident after fears of a liquidity crisis in the U.S. financial system somewhat waned following an assurance from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that the banking sector is on solid ground.However, the survey showed that consumers’ expectations of inflation rising over the next year has made them more inclined toward slashing spending on consumer discretionary goods, including visiting amusement parks and dining out.Despite rising costs, people will need to spend on consumer staples and other necessities. Such stocks are unlikely to be affected by market volatility and rising inflation and recession worries. Thus, consumer staples stocks are currently a safe pick for investors.The sector is known for the transparency and consistency of its profitability and cash flow. So, adding stocks to a portfolio from the consumer staples basket makes it more resilient in a choppy market.Our ChoicesThe Hershey Company is the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America as well as a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery.

Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins said in a speech in Washington at the NABE Economic Policy Conference on Thursday that she is in support of another 0.25% interest rate hike amid persistent inflation in the wake of the recent banking turmoil.Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin echoed that sentiment, saying it was appropriate for interest rates to increase by 0.25%.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Cheap Beginner Stocks to Buy.Morgan Stanley's Big Bear: ""It's Just A Much Less Predictable World""On March 27 Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist, Mike Wilson, gave an interview to Bloomberg where he discussed his view of the markets right now. Wilson noted that the bond market is not moving in coherence with the Fed, and he thinks the equities market will follow this trajectory. Here are some comments from Mike Wilson:""It's just a much less predictable world, and this has been our theme for the last couple of years, that we're entering a period of economic volatility. The last 20 years has been a world of repression where all of these metrics were somewhat predictable, and that's for companies, that's for the Fed itself, that's for investors. And now we're entering a world when it's just not as predictable, and that means higher risk premiums. Whether we're talking about credit, whether we're talking about term premium in the bond market, or we're talking about equity risk premium. In our view, I think people are operating as if we're gonna go back to that predictable world and that's, I think, misplaced.""Mike Wilson said that the degradation in multiples that stocks had last year was due to higher interest rates and not higher risk premiums. According to Wilson, the market has started to ""revalue, or devalue, the companies that are most at risk of missing estimates"". The companies that are expected to come under pressure in a high interest rate environment and are most at risk of missing estimates, according to Wilson, include small-cap, lower quality, and cyclical companies.Moreover, Mike Wilson pointed out that tech companies experienced significant declines in their stock prices last year due to their high valuations and sensitivity to rising interest rates. While these companies have cut costs, which has led to them rallying, Wilson believes that there are still risks associated with investing in them especially given the potential for further cost pressures.Story continuesThere are some areas within the market that Mike Wilson thinks have repriced and are presenting an opportunity. The financials segment has ""repriced in a meaningful way"", said Wilson. Moreover, some consumer-focused businesses and the retail segment have also repriced. Mike Wilson thinks there are opportunities in individual stocks, as opposed to indices, which do not look as attractive to him at this point in time.Finally, Mike Wilson thinks that valuations will reset over the next two quarters. However, he also said that he does not think stock valuations will stay low for long, and this is not a ""secular structural bear market"", it is actually a ""cyclical bear market"" and there is enough liquidity to stabilize things.The markets are extremely volatile and uncertain right now, given sticky inflation and a hawkish Fed. In times like these, retail investors can feel overwhelmed when it comes to investing in the stock market. However, looking at where institutional investors are parking cash can be insightful, as they have the resources and expertise to make sensical investment decisions. We have compiled a list of the 15 cheap beginner stocks to buy now according to hedge funds, which include QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). Let's now discuss these, among others, in detail.15 Cheap Beginner Stocks to BuyPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe scanned Insider Monkey's database, which tracks over 900 elite hedge funds as of Q4 2022, to find the 50 most popular stocks among institutional investors. We then checked each stock's trailing twelve-month price-to-earnings ratio from Yahoo Finance and narrowed down our selection to the 15 stocks that had a TTM PE ratio of less than 15, as of March 28, and were the most widely held by money managers.The idea was to identify cheap stocks that are safe for beginner investors who want to avoid volatility and risks.We have ranked these stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them. Where the number of hedge funds were the same, we used the PE ratio as the tie-breaker.Cheap Beginner Stocks to Buy15.

Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy. For the first three quarters of the year, we should change the name of our fund to the Jed Clampett Fund. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), was one of the standouts. Up through the bear market came a “bubblin’ crude!”14. Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR)PE Ratio (TTM) as of March 28: 11.18 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Charter Communications, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CHTR) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Cable stocks have been pressured for the past year as broadband growth has slowed following a pull forward of demand during the pandemic and the industry faces rising competition from wireless carriers offering fixed wireless access. In particular, shares of Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) were pressured by its recently announced multiyear capex plan to accelerate network upgrades. While this reduces free cash flow available for buybacks in the medium term, it sustains the company’s competitive advantage and should accelerate long term growth. The company also has ambitious goals to expand its footprint into adjacent and rural markets, taking advantage of the federal and state broadband subsidies.

The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)11. Biogen Inc.

Cigna Healthcare provides health insurance products, including a business in which Cigna provides administrative services only to plan sponsors (employers, unions, and other groups). Evernorth provides a portfolio of health care services, including pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services, care delivery services, data and analytics solutions, and distribution of specialty drugs. Each segment has a portion of business that provides steady, predictable growth. These foundational businesses, which account for roughly 60% of total revenue, include the U.S. commercial business, the PBM business, and international. The other 40% of revenue comes from higher-growth businesses, including the specialty pharmacy business, care delivery services, and Medicare Advantage. Management targets 10% to 13% annual EPS growth over the long term. The stock trades at a significant discount to industry peers because of the company’s commercial health insurance and PBM business mix. We think the PBM business will benefit from the biosimilar wave in the next few years, and as Cigna’s higher growth businesses become a bigger percentage of the overall mix, we think the stock can appreciate at least in line with its annual EPS growth with potential for valuation expansion.”8.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Medical Stocks To Invest In. The global healthcare sector has been permanently transformed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in a faster adoption of novel technologies and care delivery methods, as well as a heightened emphasis on sustainability and resilience. The COVID-19 outbreak brought about a rapid increase in patients, rising healthcare requirements, workforce scarcities, and difficulties in supply chain management. In response, healthcare providers turned to innovative solutions like telemedicine and electronic health records (EHRs) to tackle these problems effectively. These digital technologies were aimed at reducing costs, managing fluctuating demand patterns, addressing the shortage of medical personnel, and improving readiness for potential future global health crises.There is a growing need for healthcare services from small businesses, including clinics, labs, and other providers that cater to local communities. Despite the ongoing trend of consolidation into larger healthcare groups and hospitals, it is predicted that the number of small healthcare practices will increase in 2023. According to IBISWorld, the number of companies that specialize in primary care is expected to rise steadily at a yearly rate of 1.6%, reaching 152,496 businesses by 2027. The outlook for the healthcare sector is predicted to be neutral in 2023 due to various factors, such as a rise in demand for services, the use of a more affordable and personalized delivery approach, progress in business technology, and the capacity to adjust to the evolving healthcare environment.In 2023, healthcare expenses are expected to decrease in real terms due to high inflation rates and sluggish economic growth, as per a report by Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). This scenario will prompt the need for difficult decisions on how to provide care. The healthcare system will continue to digitize, but there will be stricter regulations on the use of health data in the US, Europe, and China. Patent cliffs for vital drugs and attempts to regulate pharmaceutical pricing in countries such as the US and India will lead major pharma companies to pursue growth via mergers and acquisitions. Despite investing in more localized pharmaceutical production, drugmakers' expenses will still increase due to ongoing supply chain disruptions. Story continuesAmid this market outlook, some of the best medical stocks to invest in include Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), HCA Healthcare, Inc.

Although 2023 may still have some fluctuations, the company's operational performance is improving, and there may be approximately $1 billion worth of share repurchases during the year. Evercore ISI believes that there are both fundamental and technical reasons to continue investing in Align Technology. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 34 hedge funds were bullish on Align Technology, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ALGN), is a leader in the orthodontic industry that pioneered the clear aligner segment with its well-known Invisalign ™ product. Pandemic-related disruptions to earnings and the impact of tough foreign exchange rates on Align’s significant international business pushed the stock’s valuation to what we believed was an attractive level. We believe the company remains an industry leader and that clear aligners, which hold an industry penetration rate of roughly 15%, have a long runway for growth, so we initiated a position during the quarter.”12. DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) offers kidney dialysis services to patients in the United States who have chronic kidney failure. The company runs centers where patients can receive dialysis treatment and also provides laboratory services at outpatient dialysis centers. Additionally, DaVita Inc.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 36 million shares worth $2.7 billion. Moon Capital made the following comment about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)11.

The company has been quietly bolstering its business model during the past few years to include animal health products for the European market and an expanded line of higher-margin, value-added services that reach beyond drug distribution. During these efforts, valuations for the company have been under pressure due to liability issues stemming from opioid litigation as well as concerns about increased scrutiny of drug prices by politicians.Our team has been following these developments and believes the strides management has made on the business side are not being fully recognized by the market. As more clarity has emerged related to opioid litigation, we’ve increased the portfolio’s stake in AmerisourceBergen and believe the investment provides the portfolio with additional exposure to a high-quality business that is well positioned to grow despite operating in a mature industry.”8.

When we first established the position in 2018, we explained that, “Although headlines remind us daily of growing threats to the business, the actual probability of this business dramatically changing in the next five years is much lower than the perceived probability. We are simply betting that the future might not be as bad as the price suggests.”Consensus FY22 and FY23 EPS estimates at the time were around $17 – $18 per share. The company reported ~ $24 in earnings in FY22, and is on pace for $26 in FY23, even as consensus estimates for the broader market were repeatedly revised lower.

The research found that innovation isn’t just a nice-to-have. In the last three years, almost every company on this list posted revenue growth.Most of the top 10 companies on the list come from the tech sector, with Alphabet taking the No. 1 spot. However, a financial services company made the top 10—Capital One Financial. Richard D. Fairbank, founder, chairman, and CEO of Capital One, grew the McLean, Va.-based company to one of the 10 largest banks in America and 100 largest companies in the country with $38 billion in annual revenue.Digital transformation in financial services has been accelerating, in general. But Capital One ranked in the top 10% for process innovation among the companies on Fortune's list. Fairbank has led the transformation of the company’s business capabilities, including technology.""Beginning in 2012, we sought to completely redefine who we are as a company—to operate like a bank that a technology company would build,"" Rob Alexander, CIO at Capital One, told me. ""You could say that we have been focused on data and technology ever since our founding days as a company."" Fairbank started Capital One with ""the idea that an information-based strategy could enable us to build a better financial services business,"" Alexander says. ""This early vision has scaled as we’ve grown our company, and we’ve seen that technology and data can enable even large companies to be innovative and personalized.""Some examples? The company ""solved a lot of technology challenges faced by America’s largest enterprises, and last year announced Capital One Software, our enterprise B2B software business, to bring some of these solutions to market,"" Alexander explains. ""Machine learning, A.I., and real-time data are central to how we build our products and services for customers and to how we run our company. Through machine learning, we can proactively serve contextually relevant, personalized information and insights for customers through our mobile app—helping them to get the most out of their money.""Story continuesHe continues, ""We’ve also built a fraud platform to make complex real-time machine learning decisions, with more data, in the time it takes our customers to swipe their credit cards.""""Our tech organization is actively recruiting for a range of positions, including engineering roles focused on cloud, data, machine learning, and cybersecurity, as well as product managers and technical program managers,"" Alexander says.Fairbank continues his support for a digitally forward company. “As a result of our investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth, we're in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios,” he said during the company’s earnings call in January.Tech's future in financial services is bright.Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

To see more such companies, go directly to Starter Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Stocks To Buy.Amid the current market turmoil which seems to have no end in sight, it feels weird to label anything as “safe,” especially stocks, which are spooking investors more and more, forcing them to pull money from the stock market and invest in other investment vehicles. A Wall Street Journal report earlier this month quoted  a survey from Bank of America, which said that fund managers’ allocation of stocks is now at about 2.2 standard deviations below its long-term average. The report said that instead of stocks, fund managers are gaining more exposure to bonds, emerging markets, cash and commodities.However, for those who are still interested in investing in the stock market, there’s almost a consensus among analysts that short-term market cycles should not blur your long-term outlook.""Don't Fear the Bear""According to an Edward Jones report titled “Don’t Fear The Bear,” from 1900 through 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) has had an average annual return of 9.9%, including dividends. The report said that investors should invest in quality stocks and should not worry about the short-term bear markets.“Instead of worrying about the timing of the next bear market, prepare your portfolio today with an appropriate mix of quality investments so you can stay invested in both bear and bull markets over time”When it comes to investment options for beginners, ETFs have gained a lot of popularity over the past few years, thanks to the wider exposure they provide to a basket of stocks with limited risks. One of the biggest benefits of investing in ETFs is that they give you exposure to a wide range of stocks in budget. Investing in ETFs also saves you a lot of money in transaction fees that comes with trading individual stocks. When you are investing ETFs, your transactions fees is limited when compared to stocks and mutual funds.Story continuesThe Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF is one of the most recommended ETFs for beginner investors since the ETF is composed of low-risk, high-quality stocks that are considered the safest. For this article, we scanned the top holdings of the ETF and picked 15 stocks that are considered the safest for beginner investors. We started from the top of the ETF’s holdings and picked stocks that are dominating their industries and have strong dividend histories. Given the current banking crisis and the volatility in the financial sector, we skipped banks and financial services stocks.The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors for each stock, which we took from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.Starter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To BuyPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To Buy15. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57With over 35 years of consistent dividend increases and a dividend yield of over 3.5%, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is one of the best and safest stocks to buy for beginners. Recently, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar increased the price target of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock to $206 from $200 and kept a Buy rating.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 57 hedge funds out of the 943 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). The total value of these stakes was $32 billion. A whopping $29 billion of these $32 billion stakes was owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.Carillon Eagle Growth &amp; Income Fund made the following comment about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)  in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Energy performed well during the fourth quarter, with the sector up about 23%. Investors returned to the sector after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) signaled it would reduce production. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) reported strong quarterly results while buying back stock, paying a healthy dividend, and maintaining a strong balance sheet.”14. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the best defensive stock picks for a recessionary environment according to several analysts. Last month, Citi started covering The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) with a Buy rating and a $68 price target. During the same month, Morgan Stanley kept an Overweight rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) but raised its price target to $70.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 58 hedge funds had stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) according to Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds. The biggest stakeholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  (NYSE:BRK-B) which had a $25 billion stake.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”13. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62With years of consistent dividend increases and a solid underlying business, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is one of the best picks for any starter stock portfolio.Recently, UBS ran a machine-learning model to select its top dividend picks. Unsurprisingly, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) made it to the list of these dividend stocks.The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) recently posted weak Q4 results. But several Wall Street analysts kept their optimistic view of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD). For example, BofA’s Elizabeth Suzuki said that The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)’s 2023 guidance may be overly conservative.The analyst expects home investment to remain above pre-COVID levels as she believes the “tailwinds for the home improvement industry are generally favorable.”Matrix Asset Advisors made the following comment about The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“During the quarter, we re-established a position in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) sold earlier this year, after the shares declined sharply on big picture concerns about a softer housing market and lower consumer spending. We believe that HD is a very well-managed company, positioned to continue showing good profits even as the economy decelerates. The products it carries in inventory are in year-round demand from contractors and homeowners wanting to maintain and improve their homes. The company has historically been shareholder friendly, repurchasing shares and increasing the dividend, most recently by 15% earlier this year. On September 30, HD’s current dividend yield was 2.8%.”12. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the stocks that remain stable even during recessions and high inflation. Recently, Bank of America said that food inflation could provide an upside potential to several grocery stocks and warehouse clubs like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST).At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 66 hedge funds had stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). The total value of these stakes was $3.4 billion.Madison Funds made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has raised its dividends consecutively for 50 years. The biggest retailer in the US has a stable business and long-term growth catalysts. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was among the “sleep at night” stocks picked up by BofA’s dividend growers screen recently.10. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73With several drugs in the pipeline and a solid dividend history, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is one of the best stock picks for starters. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a member of the S&amp;P Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks companies that have annually increased their dividend for at least 25 consecutive years.Earlier this year, Guggenheim started covering AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) with a Buy rating and a $172 price target.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 73 hedge funds had stakes in AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), according to Insider Monkey’s proprietary database. The total value of these hedge funds’ stakes was $1.5 billion. The biggest stakeholder of AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) was Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management which had a $229 million stake in the company.Alger Capital made the following comment about AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a global biopharmaceutical company that develops and markets drugs in areas such as immunology. virology and oncology. Recently, the company expanded through the acquisition of Allergan, which added robust growth assets to help offset the loss of U.S. patent protection for Humira, a leading treatment used for rheumatology, dermatology. gastroenterology, and ophthalmology. While AbbVie reported weak third quarter revenues across the board, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vraylar (an antipsychotic treatment) in December. Despite concerns around Humira’s loss of patent protection, we believe AbbVie has significantly diversified its revenue and that its launch of Rinvog for psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis could be promising.”9. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been upping its dividends for 66 years without a break. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) ranks 9th in our list of the safest stocks for starter stock portfolios.Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank selected The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as one of its top picks in the consumer packaged goods category.Another bullish call for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) recently came from JPMorgan, where analyst Andrea Teixeria upgraded the company shares to Overweight from Neutral.Out of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 74 hedge funds had stakes in The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). The biggest stakeholder of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates which had a $757 million stake in the company.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75What makes Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) an ideal pick for beginner investors looking for safe stocks is the company’s presence in several important healthcare sectors and a diversified business. Recently, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) said it will buy Seagen, an oncology-focused biotech company, for $43 billion.Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has a huge pipeline. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is making treatments for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular diseases in addition to making vaccines. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is also working on treatments for rare diseases like hemophilia, Huntington's disease, and sickle cell anemia.Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”7. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Pharma giant Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) ranks 7th in our list of the best starter stock portfolio picks. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has increased its dividend for over a decade now.Recently, Berenberg analyst Luisa Hector increased Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)’s price target to $130 from $125 and kept a Buy rating. The analyst believes Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has room to run after ""significant de-risking"" of the company's cardiovascular pipeline.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 77 hedge funds had stakes in Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), according to Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds.Artisan Value Fund made the following comment about Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a provider of health care solutions including prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, animal health and consumer care products. Shares have benefited from investors seeking safety in areas with less economic and interest rate sensitivity. With about one third of its sales generated by blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, the key issue for investors is the success of its large R&amp;D pipeline to replace those sales when Keytruda comes off patent in 2028. However, Merck seems to be getting little credit from investors for the 60+ programs it has in clinical development, despite having several solid and large new product opportunities. Additionally, the company’s strong balance sheet and robust free cash flow provide it multiple options for future partnerships and acquisitions, besides return of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.”6.

(NASDAQ:COKE) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 38% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$5.0b in market cap. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 8.9%.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Coca-Cola Consolidated. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Consolidated ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Coca-Cola Consolidated?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Coca-Cola Consolidated already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Coca-Cola Consolidated, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthHedge funds don't have many shares in Coca-Cola Consolidated. The Coca-Cola Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 26% of shares outstanding. J. Harrison is the second largest shareholder owning 11% of common stock, and Sue Anne Wells holds about 6.4% of the company stock. J. Harrison, who is the second-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chief Executive Officer.Story continuesTo make our study more interesting, we found that the top 5 shareholders control more than half of the company which implies that this group has considerable sway over the company's decision-making.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. As far as we can tell there isn't analyst coverage of the company, so it is probably flying under the radar.Insider Ownership Of Coca-Cola ConsolidatedThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$5.0b, and insiders have US$1.2b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in Coca-Cola Consolidated. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 26% of Coca-Cola Consolidated. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

Year-to-date, the index is down 1.67% and returned 11.49% in the past six months, as of March 29. Some important Dow companies include Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).The companies that make up the DJIA are leaders in their respective industries and are considered to be representative of the overall performance of the U.S. stock market. The DJIA is often used as a benchmark for the performance of the U.S. stock market as a whole, and investors and analysts use it to track the performance of individual companies and to make investment decisions. The index has shown strong performance over the past years relative to its counterpart, the S&amp;P 500. According to a report by Forbes, the index delivered an average annual return of 16.65% in three years that ended in 2019, compared with a 14.03% annualized return on the S&amp;P 500. In our previous article, we shed light on the performance of both indexes and reported that the Dow has outperformed the wider market over the last 30 years that ended June 2021. During this period, the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 10.6% return, compared with an 11.16% return of the DJIA.In the current market situation, dividend stocks are gaining a lot of traction among investors as they try to generate stable and regular income. When it comes to dividend investing, companies that have proven dividend growth track records become popular because of their strong cash flow generation and solid balance sheets. Dividend growers also dominate the market, especially during periods of high turbulence. A report by Capital Group revealed the importance of dividend stocks and mentioned that they accounted for nearly one-third of the market’s total return from 1926 to 2021. The report also mentioned that dividend growers returned 9.3% to shareholders from 1990 to 2022, with a 14.5% volatility. In comparison, non-dividend payers delivered a 4% return during the same period, with a volatility of 19.7%.

(NYSE:NKE) is an Oregon-based multinational footwear manufacturing company that also manufactures apparel, equipment, and other related accessories. In fiscal Q3 2022, the company posted revenue of $12.4 billion, which showed a 14% growth from the same period last year.

Nike reported 17% revenue growth (27% on a currency neutral basis) and $0.85 EPS, both significantly greater than expectations. Management raised its F23 outlook to low teens currency-neutral revenue growth.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect gross and operating margin improvements as it shifts its product mix to more premium products and adopts a more direct to consumer approach, driving long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”10. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an American financial services company that specializes in payment cards. The company raised its quarterly dividend by 15% on March 9 to $0.60 per share. It has been making regular dividend payments to shareholders for the past 30 years.

The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74An American multinational consumer goods corporation, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”8. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a New York-based multinational investment banking company that also provides other financial services to its consumers.

(NYSE:GS), up from 69 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is roughly $5 billion.Here is what Manole Capital Management had to say about The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)7.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Climate Change Stocks To Invest In.As governments around the world push for a greener future, climate investing is gaining popularity. Companies are finally starting to understand the enormous opportunities in the sustainable investment sphere. Data shows that funds that focus on sustainable investing managed to perform well in 2022, when the broader market faced a huge turmoil amid the macroeconomic situation. According to a Wall Street Journal report, investments in sustainable funds in the US, including stocks, bonds and other categories, fell to $3.1 billion in 2022 from $69.2 billion a year earlier. This decline seems paltry when compared to conventional funds (funds that don’t take into account ESG when investing) which suffered a whopping $370 billion worth of withdrawals in 2022.The WSJ report added that 75% of the total inflows seen by sustainable funds in 2022 were from fixed-income funds, a surprise when seen in the context of the rising interest rate environment.The Importance of Climate InvestingAs humanity inches closer to a point of no return in terms of carbon emissions, climate-focused groups in investing circles are voicing their concerns and pushing companies to start paying more attention to ESG when taking decisions. Investor Group on Climate Change recently warned in a report that in order to avoid “catastrophic” long-term risks, money managers will need to make an effort to measure the physical impact of climate change across their portfolios, according to Bloomberg. The group analyzed 53 funds with more than $20.2 trillion under management globally. Results of the study show just under a quarter of the funds have assessed their portfolios for these climate-related risks.Don't Miss: Best Renewable Energy Stocks to BuyOur MethodologyFor this article we decided to focus on companies that are working on solutions for the climate change problem and have a high exposure to industries that play a key role in the climate change dynamics.

(NYSE:XYL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL), the water equipment and services supplier, was a leading contributor for the quarter. The company’s solutions and technology continued to enjoy strong global demand as public utilities, as well as industrial, commercial and residential clients, seek solutions to treat, test, transport and preserve water. Similar to other industries, Xylem’s business has been impacted in the short term by the effects of inflation and chip‐supply constraints (that are now moderating), leading to an increasing backlog that has delayed the ability to fulfill orders. We believe Xylem’s portfolio of highly differentiated pumps, recognized for their quality and critical uses, as well as the company’s ability to cross‐sell and link other products, such as sensors and smart meters, will make it a one‐stop shop for utilities and protect the company from pure price competition. In our opinion, long‐term trends, such as water scarcity and the need to replace aging water infrastructure, create strong underlying demand for Xylem’s products through various parts of the economic cycle.”10.

Both companies should also benefit from the IRA as they enable greater energy efficiency in a variety of settings: Regal Rexnord innovates through best-in-class engineering capabilities to help customers achieve their energy efficiency objectives; Trane’s products enable lower energy demand and emissions in HVAC systems and buildings, where it estimates ~15%–25% of all GHG emissions are emitted.According to ClearBridge holding Trane Technologies, under ideal conditions, a heat pump can transfer 300% more energy than it consumes. In contrast, a high efficiency gas furnace is only about 95% efficient. Further, heat pumps are powered by electricity, creating substantial potential fuel savings. Assuming the electricity comes from clean energy sources, heat pumps are also much more “green.”Heat pumps gained prominence in June when President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act of 1950 to call for more domestic production of heat pumps to reduce American energy bills, fight climate change and free up U.S. natural gas to support allies in Europe. The IRA, which provides $500 million in funding for expanding production of heat pumps as well as processing critical minerals, should be a plus for manufacturers and ClearBridge holdings like Trane and Johnson Controls (JCI).”6.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, long term Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) shareholders have enjoyed a 83% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 45% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 0.7% , including dividends .Since it's been a strong week for Waste Management shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. View our latest analysis for Waste Management There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Waste Management achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 4.4% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Waste Management has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Waste Management's TSR for the last 5 years was 100%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Waste Management has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 0.7% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 15% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Waste Management better, we need to consider many other factors.

The COVID-19 outbreak brought about a rapid increase in patients, rising healthcare requirements, workforce scarcities, and difficulties in supply chain management. In response, healthcare providers turned to innovative solutions like telemedicine and electronic health records (EHRs) to tackle these problems effectively. These digital technologies were aimed at reducing costs, managing fluctuating demand patterns, addressing the shortage of medical personnel, and improving readiness for potential future global health crises.There is a growing need for healthcare services from small businesses, including clinics, labs, and other providers that cater to local communities. Despite the ongoing trend of consolidation into larger healthcare groups and hospitals, it is predicted that the number of small healthcare practices will increase in 2023. According to IBISWorld, the number of companies that specialize in primary care is expected to rise steadily at a yearly rate of 1.6%, reaching 152,496 businesses by 2027. The outlook for the healthcare sector is predicted to be neutral in 2023 due to various factors, such as a rise in demand for services, the use of a more affordable and personalized delivery approach, progress in business technology, and the capacity to adjust to the evolving healthcare environment.In 2023, healthcare expenses are expected to decrease in real terms due to high inflation rates and sluggish economic growth, as per a report by Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). This scenario will prompt the need for difficult decisions on how to provide care. The healthcare system will continue to digitize, but there will be stricter regulations on the use of health data in the US, Europe, and China. Patent cliffs for vital drugs and attempts to regulate pharmaceutical pricing in countries such as the US and India will lead major pharma companies to pursue growth via mergers and acquisitions. Despite investing in more localized pharmaceutical production, drugmakers' expenses will still increase due to ongoing supply chain disruptions. Story continuesAmid this market outlook, some of the best medical stocks to invest in include Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), HCA Healthcare, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ALGN) designs, manufactures, and promotes Invisalign transparent braces, as well as iTero dental scanners and related services. These products are aimed at orthodontists and general dental practitioners, and are sold both in the United States and internationally, including in Switzerland and China. On February 6, Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) announced a new accelerated share buyback agreement with Citibank to repurchase $250 million of the company’s common stock.On February 2, Elizabeth Anderson, an analyst at Evercore ISI, increased the target price for Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) from $230 to $375 and maintained an Outperform rating on the company's shares. According to the firm, Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN)’s Q4 financial results were better than expected, and the outlook for Q1 suggests a positive trend for 2023 and beyond. Although 2023 may still have some fluctuations, the company's operational performance is improving, and there may be approximately $1 billion worth of share repurchases during the year. Evercore ISI believes that there are both fundamental and technical reasons to continue investing in Align Technology. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 34 hedge funds were bullish on Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN), compared to 38 funds in the prior quarter. Brian Bares’ Bares Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 935,246 shares worth $197.2 million. In addition to Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), and DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) is one of the best medical stocks to invest in. Meridian Contrarian Fund made the following comment about Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN), is a leader in the orthodontic industry that pioneered the clear aligner segment with its well-known Invisalign ™ product. Pandemic-related disruptions to earnings and the impact of tough foreign exchange rates on Align’s significant international business pushed the stock’s valuation to what we believed was an attractive level. We believe the company remains an industry leader and that clear aligners, which hold an industry penetration rate of roughly 15%, have a long runway for growth, so we initiated a position during the quarter.”12. DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) offers kidney dialysis services to patients in the United States who have chronic kidney failure. The company runs centers where patients can receive dialysis treatment and also provides laboratory services at outpatient dialysis centers. Additionally, DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) provides hemodialysis services that can be done on an outpatient basis, in a hospital setting, or even at the patient's own home. It is one of the best medical stocks to invest in. On February 23, Gary Taylor, an analyst at Cowen, increased the target price on DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) shares from $76 to $90 and maintained an Outperform rating. According to the analyst, the labor costs in Q4 did not experience a significant decline compared to the previous quarter, despite the company's guidance in October. However, it is worth noting that DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) has raised the lower end of its guidance, which suggests a positive outlook for the company's future performance, the analyst wrote in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 34 hedge funds were bullish on DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), compared to 30 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 36 million shares worth $2.7 billion. Moon Capital made the following comment about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)11.

During these efforts, valuations for the company have been under pressure due to liability issues stemming from opioid litigation as well as concerns about increased scrutiny of drug prices by politicians.Our team has been following these developments and believes the strides management has made on the business side are not being fully recognized by the market.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Climate Change Stocks To Invest In.As governments around the world push for a greener future, climate investing is gaining popularity. Companies are finally starting to understand the enormous opportunities in the sustainable investment sphere. Data shows that funds that focus on sustainable investing managed to perform well in 2022, when the broader market faced a huge turmoil amid the macroeconomic situation. According to a Wall Street Journal report, investments in sustainable funds in the US, including stocks, bonds and other categories, fell to $3.1 billion in 2022 from $69.2 billion a year earlier. This decline seems paltry when compared to conventional funds (funds that don’t take into account ESG when investing) which suffered a whopping $370 billion worth of withdrawals in 2022.The WSJ report added that 75% of the total inflows seen by sustainable funds in 2022 were from fixed-income funds, a surprise when seen in the context of the rising interest rate environment.The Importance of Climate InvestingAs humanity inches closer to a point of no return in terms of carbon emissions, climate-focused groups in investing circles are voicing their concerns and pushing companies to start paying more attention to ESG when taking decisions. Investor Group on Climate Change recently warned in a report that in order to avoid “catastrophic” long-term risks, money managers will need to make an effort to measure the physical impact of climate change across their portfolios, according to Bloomberg. The group analyzed 53 funds with more than $20.2 trillion under management globally. Results of the study show just under a quarter of the funds have assessed their portfolios for these climate-related risks.Don't Miss: Best Renewable Energy Stocks to BuyOur MethodologyFor this article we decided to focus on companies that are working on solutions for the climate change problem and have a high exposure to industries that play a key role in the climate change dynamics.

(NYSE:XYL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL), the water equipment and services supplier, was a leading contributor for the quarter. The company’s solutions and technology continued to enjoy strong global demand as public utilities, as well as industrial, commercial and residential clients, seek solutions to treat, test, transport and preserve water. Similar to other industries, Xylem’s business has been impacted in the short term by the effects of inflation and chip‐supply constraints (that are now moderating), leading to an increasing backlog that has delayed the ability to fulfill orders. We believe Xylem’s portfolio of highly differentiated pumps, recognized for their quality and critical uses, as well as the company’s ability to cross‐sell and link other products, such as sensors and smart meters, will make it a one‐stop shop for utilities and protect the company from pure price competition. In our opinion, long‐term trends, such as water scarcity and the need to replace aging water infrastructure, create strong underlying demand for Xylem’s products through various parts of the economic cycle.”10.

Both companies should also benefit from the IRA as they enable greater energy efficiency in a variety of settings: Regal Rexnord innovates through best-in-class engineering capabilities to help customers achieve their energy efficiency objectives; Trane’s products enable lower energy demand and emissions in HVAC systems and buildings, where it estimates ~15%–25% of all GHG emissions are emitted.According to ClearBridge holding Trane Technologies, under ideal conditions, a heat pump can transfer 300% more energy than it consumes. In contrast, a high efficiency gas furnace is only about 95% efficient. Further, heat pumps are powered by electricity, creating substantial potential fuel savings. Assuming the electricity comes from clean energy sources, heat pumps are also much more “green.”Heat pumps gained prominence in June when President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act of 1950 to call for more domestic production of heat pumps to reduce American energy bills, fight climate change and free up U.S. natural gas to support allies in Europe. The IRA, which provides $500 million in funding for expanding production of heat pumps as well as processing critical minerals, should be a plus for manufacturers and ClearBridge holdings like Trane and Johnson Controls (JCI).”6.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Vulcan Materials Is Vulcan Materials Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$756.8mUS$877.4mUS$1.05bUS$1.11bUS$1.30bUS$1.42bUS$1.52bUS$1.61bUS$1.68bUS$1.74bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 9.23%Est @ 7.08%Est @ 5.58%Est @ 4.53%Est @ 3.79% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$704US$759US$842US$828US$906US$920US$916US$900US$875US$844(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.5bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.7b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.1%) = US$33bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$33b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$16bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$24b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$170, the company appears about fair value at a 7.0% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Vulcan Materials as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.917. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Vulcan MaterialsStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Basic Materials market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

This has outpaced the Conglomerates sector's gain of 0.58% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.72% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from General Electric as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 25, 2023. In that report, analysts expect General Electric to post earnings of $0.12 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 50%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $13.36 billion, down 21.62% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $1.97 per share and revenue of $61.65 billion, which would represent changes of -24.81% and -19.46%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for General Electric should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

The contracts have been awarded as part of a five-year Framework Cooperation Agreement with the possibility to extend for another three years.Furthermore, TenneT and a consortium formed by GE and McDermott have entered into an agreement based on which TenneT plans to award two further HVDC contracts in Germany for a total of approximately 4 billion euros to this consortium in April 2023.The five contracts for the GE consortia are among 11 two-gigawatt (GW) contracts awarded to HVDC suppliers by the Dutch-German Transmission Systems Operator (TSO) as part of its goal to connect 40 GW of offshore wind farms to the high voltage grids in the Netherlands and Germany. TenneT’s large-scale project resulted from the Esbjerg Declaration in May 2022 at the North Sea Energy Summit, where Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Belgium agreed to jointly install at least 65 GW of offshore wind energy by 2030 - up from 20 GW today - to accelerate Europe’s energy security following recent geopolitical developments. TenneT plans to install 20 GW each in the Dutch and German North Sea.Story continuesThe GE consortia projects cover the offshore converter platforms and the onshore converter stations for the two-way conversion between alternating and direct current. The converter stations are based on bipolar Voltage-Sourced Converter (VSC) technology – the most advanced HVDC technology – and will have double the capacity compared to previous monopole grid connection systems, resulting in fewer cables and platforms.Tim Meyerjürgens, TenneT COO, said: ""We are delighted to be working with GE and their consortium partners as part of our task to connect 40 GW offshore wind in the North Sea, one of the most important infrastructure projects of the century. TenneT has the technical know-how, scale, and geographical position to connect wind energy from the North Sea, while GE and its consortium partners have the HVDC expertise.

That has led to further pressure from U.S., European and Asian energy firms, but Washington has resisted any additional major steps for now.Venezuelan oil resumed flowing to the U.S. in January under a Treasury Department license granted to Chevron that allowed it to expand output there and export the oil. Refiners including Valero and Phillips 66 have bought cargoes from Chevron, according to U.S. Customs and shipping data.The Chevron decision came as part of negotiations for humanitarian aid and a presidential election. But efforts to fund the aid by releasing Venezuela's frozen money abroad have stalled and no new talks have been scheduled since that time.Colombia's President Gustavo Petro tweeted this week that the U.S. has agreed to attend an international conference on Venezuelan democracy to be held in Bogota.CHEVRON-STYLE EXEMPTIONValero is asking the Treasury for a Chevron-style exemption from sanctions and allow it to directly purchase crude from Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA, said one of the sources, who is based in Washington.Other details of the Valero request were not immediately known. No decision appears imminent, the source said, signaling that the U.S., for now, does not want to be seen further easing Venezuela sanctions until President Nicolas Maduro makes political concessions to Venezuela's opposition.Before oil sanctions were imposed on PDVSA in 2019, Valero was among the U.S. top three receivers of the South American country's crude through long-term supply contracts that have not expired.Story continuesA Valero spokesperson said the company has not contacted the U.S. Treasury Department for permission to import Venezuelan oil.""I am told that we have not applied for a license,"" said spokesperson Lillian Riojas.PDVSA did not reply to requests for comment. The Treasury Department declined comment.The U.S. has banned all cash payments to Maduro's administration under its easing of sanctions. Chevron's license - and approvals granted to European firms Eni and Repsol - allow only for oil or debt swaps.'NO NEW LICENSES'""The United States provided targeted, time-limited sanctions relief to support efforts to restore democracy and alleviate the suffering of the Venezuelan people,"" said a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, referring to the six-month license granted to Chevron in November.""We have no new licenses to announce or preview,"" the spokesperson added.Chevron's resumption of Venezuelan crude imports has not led to an increase in the country's overall exports this year, according to PDVSA schedules and Refinitiv Eikon data. The No. 2 U.S. oil company exported some 86,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan oil in February.PDVSA's new boss Pedro Tellechea in January suspended most oil supply contracts while reviewing payments for past shipments. That suspension has recently brought Venezuela's exports almost to a halt, with only four customers - Chevron, Iran, Cuba and Hangzhou Energy - authorized to lift cargoes.The investigation into payments and disclosure of $21.2 billion in commercial accounts receivable since 2020 this month prompted the resignation of powerful Oil Minister Tareck El Aissami and the arrest of top PDVSA officials.(Reporting by Marianna Parraga in Houston, Matt Spetalnick in Washington and Deisy Buitrago in CaracasEditing by Marguerita Choy)]"

Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Valero Energy's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Valero Energy How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Valero Energy is:47% = US$12b ÷ US$25b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.47 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Valero Energy's Earnings Growth And 47% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Valero Energy has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 30% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 11% net income growth seen by Valero Energy over the past five years. growthWe then compared Valero Energy's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 16% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Valero Energy fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Valero Energy Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?In Valero Energy's case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 17% (or a retention ratio of 83%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business.Besides, Valero Energy has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 34% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 18%, over the same period.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Valero Energy's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

401,0226902b-0ddc-37cb-a039-e00eefcde429,UNH,2023-03-31,An Intrinsic Calculation For UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) Suggests It's 39% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-unitedhealth-group-incorporated-110120319.html,1680260480,STORY,['UNH'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for UnitedHealth Group is US$776 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityUnitedHealth Group's US$470 share price signals that it might be 39% undervaluedOur fair value estimate is 32% higher than UnitedHealth Group's analyst price target of US$589Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$24.9bUS$26.4bUS$28.2bUS$31.5bUS$34.7bUS$37.1bUS$39.1bUS$40.8bUS$42.4bUS$43.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.88%Est @ 5.44%Est @ 4.43%Est @ 3.72%Est @ 3.23% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$23.3kUS$23.1kUS$23.1kUS$24.2kUS$24.9kUS$25.0kUS$24.6kUS$24.1kUS$23.4kUS$22.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$238bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$44b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$939bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$939b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$485bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$724b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$470, the company appears quite undervalued at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at UnitedHealth Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for UnitedHealth GroupStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

The move is expected to simplify the healthcare experience for both providers and members.The prior authorization process requires providers to get health plans’ coverage approvals before carrying out some non-emergency medical procedures. UNH is expected to commence the code reductions in the third quarter and continue through the remaining days of the year for most procedures in commercial, Medicare Advantage and the Medicaid business.Early next year, the company is expected to launch a solution called the national Gold Card Program for care providers, who fulfill eligibility norms. This is likely to eliminate prior authorization for most procedures. Most members of UnitedHealthcare will have Gold Card status. UNH is expected to continue to evaluate the preauthorization process to boost efficiency.Also, certain medical equipment, including orthopedic support devices, and some genetic tests utilized in diagnostics, are expected to see the removal of prior authorization requirements. Pulling back from the old process may increase costs but the impact is expected to be small. In return, it will reduce the waiting period for patients and may lower adverse events’ occurrence.Moves like these are expected to support UNH’s commercial business recovery. Other insurers and health plans are expected to follow suit, which will change the industry standards, benefiting caregivers, patients and other stakeholders.Price PerformanceUnitedHealth’s stock has declined 8.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s 7.4% fall. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksUnitedHealth currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the broader medical space may also look at players like Avanos Medical, Inc.

408,ca473dfc-dceb-33c1-8b05-b9bf6c4e1d10,EL,2023-03-31,Estée Lauder Companies (NYSE:EL) shareholders have earned a 19% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/est-e-lauder-companies-nyse-110019407.html,1680174019,STORY,['EL'],"[Thanks in no small measure to Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, it's easy buy a low cost index fund, which should provide the average market return. But you can make better returns by buying undervalued shares. To wit, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) shares are up 64% in three years, besting the market return. In contrast, the stock is actually down 10% in the last year, suggesting a lack of positive momentum.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over the last three years, Estée Lauder Companies failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 6.8% (annualized).So we doubt that the market is looking to EPS for its main judge of the company's value. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.Languishing at just 1.1%, we doubt the dividend is doing much to prop up the share price. It could be that the revenue growth of 6.5% per year is viewed as evidence that Estée Lauder Companies is growing. If the company is being managed for the long term good, today's shareholders might be right to hold on.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthEstée Lauder Companies is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Estée Lauder Companies the TSR over the last 3 years was 68%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Estée Lauder Companies shares lost 9.2% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 12%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 11% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Estée Lauder Companies better, we need to consider many other factors.

To see more such companies, go directly to Starter Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Stocks To Buy.Amid the current market turmoil which seems to have no end in sight, it feels weird to label anything as “safe,” especially stocks, which are spooking investors more and more, forcing them to pull money from the stock market and invest in other investment vehicles. A Wall Street Journal report earlier this month quoted  a survey from Bank of America, which said that fund managers’ allocation of stocks is now at about 2.2 standard deviations below its long-term average. The report said that instead of stocks, fund managers are gaining more exposure to bonds, emerging markets, cash and commodities.However, for those who are still interested in investing in the stock market, there’s almost a consensus among analysts that short-term market cycles should not blur your long-term outlook.""Don't Fear the Bear""According to an Edward Jones report titled “Don’t Fear The Bear,” from 1900 through 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) has had an average annual return of 9.9%, including dividends. The report said that investors should invest in quality stocks and should not worry about the short-term bear markets.“Instead of worrying about the timing of the next bear market, prepare your portfolio today with an appropriate mix of quality investments so you can stay invested in both bear and bull markets over time”When it comes to investment options for beginners, ETFs have gained a lot of popularity over the past few years, thanks to the wider exposure they provide to a basket of stocks with limited risks. One of the biggest benefits of investing in ETFs is that they give you exposure to a wide range of stocks in budget. Investing in ETFs also saves you a lot of money in transaction fees that comes with trading individual stocks. When you are investing ETFs, your transactions fees is limited when compared to stocks and mutual funds.Story continuesThe Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF is one of the most recommended ETFs for beginner investors since the ETF is composed of low-risk, high-quality stocks that are considered the safest. For this article, we scanned the top holdings of the ETF and picked 15 stocks that are considered the safest for beginner investors. We started from the top of the ETF’s holdings and picked stocks that are dominating their industries and have strong dividend histories. Given the current banking crisis and the volatility in the financial sector, we skipped banks and financial services stocks.The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors for each stock, which we took from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.Starter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To BuyPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To Buy15. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57With over 35 years of consistent dividend increases and a dividend yield of over 3.5%, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is one of the best and safest stocks to buy for beginners. Recently, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar increased the price target of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock to $206 from $200 and kept a Buy rating.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 57 hedge funds out of the 943 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). The total value of these stakes was $32 billion. A whopping $29 billion of these $32 billion stakes was owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.Carillon Eagle Growth &amp; Income Fund made the following comment about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)  in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Energy performed well during the fourth quarter, with the sector up about 23%. Investors returned to the sector after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) signaled it would reduce production. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) reported strong quarterly results while buying back stock, paying a healthy dividend, and maintaining a strong balance sheet.”14. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the best defensive stock picks for a recessionary environment according to several analysts. Last month, Citi started covering The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) with a Buy rating and a $68 price target. During the same month, Morgan Stanley kept an Overweight rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) but raised its price target to $70.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 58 hedge funds had stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) according to Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds. The biggest stakeholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  (NYSE:BRK-B) which had a $25 billion stake.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”13. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62With years of consistent dividend increases and a solid underlying business, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is one of the best picks for any starter stock portfolio.Recently, UBS ran a machine-learning model to select its top dividend picks. Unsurprisingly, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) made it to the list of these dividend stocks.The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) recently posted weak Q4 results. But several Wall Street analysts kept their optimistic view of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD). For example, BofA’s Elizabeth Suzuki said that The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)’s 2023 guidance may be overly conservative.The analyst expects home investment to remain above pre-COVID levels as she believes the “tailwinds for the home improvement industry are generally favorable.”Matrix Asset Advisors made the following comment about The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“During the quarter, we re-established a position in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) sold earlier this year, after the shares declined sharply on big picture concerns about a softer housing market and lower consumer spending. We believe that HD is a very well-managed company, positioned to continue showing good profits even as the economy decelerates. The products it carries in inventory are in year-round demand from contractors and homeowners wanting to maintain and improve their homes. The company has historically been shareholder friendly, repurchasing shares and increasing the dividend, most recently by 15% earlier this year. On September 30, HD’s current dividend yield was 2.8%.”12. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the stocks that remain stable even during recessions and high inflation. Recently, Bank of America said that food inflation could provide an upside potential to several grocery stocks and warehouse clubs like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST).At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 66 hedge funds had stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). The total value of these stakes was $3.4 billion.Madison Funds made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”11. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has raised its dividends consecutively for 50 years. The biggest retailer in the US has a stable business and long-term growth catalysts. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was among the “sleep at night” stocks picked up by BofA’s dividend growers screen recently.10. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73With several drugs in the pipeline and a solid dividend history, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is one of the best stock picks for starters. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a member of the S&amp;P Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks companies that have annually increased their dividend for at least 25 consecutive years.Earlier this year, Guggenheim started covering AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) with a Buy rating and a $172 price target.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 73 hedge funds had stakes in AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), according to Insider Monkey’s proprietary database. The total value of these hedge funds’ stakes was $1.5 billion. The biggest stakeholder of AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) was Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management which had a $229 million stake in the company.Alger Capital made the following comment about AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a global biopharmaceutical company that develops and markets drugs in areas such as immunology. virology and oncology. Recently, the company expanded through the acquisition of Allergan, which added robust growth assets to help offset the loss of U.S. patent protection for Humira, a leading treatment used for rheumatology, dermatology. gastroenterology, and ophthalmology. While AbbVie reported weak third quarter revenues across the board, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vraylar (an antipsychotic treatment) in December. Despite concerns around Humira’s loss of patent protection, we believe AbbVie has significantly diversified its revenue and that its launch of Rinvog for psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis could be promising.”9. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been upping its dividends for 66 years without a break. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) ranks 9th in our list of the safest stocks for starter stock portfolios.Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank selected The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as one of its top picks in the consumer packaged goods category.Another bullish call for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) recently came from JPMorgan, where analyst Andrea Teixeria upgraded the company shares to Overweight from Neutral.Out of the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 74 hedge funds had stakes in The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). The biggest stakeholder of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates which had a $757 million stake in the company.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75What makes Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) an ideal pick for beginner investors looking for safe stocks is the company’s presence in several important healthcare sectors and a diversified business. Recently, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) said it will buy Seagen, an oncology-focused biotech company, for $43 billion.Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has a huge pipeline. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is making treatments for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular diseases in addition to making vaccines. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is also working on treatments for rare diseases like hemophilia, Huntington's disease, and sickle cell anemia.Diamond Hill Capital made the following comment about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”7. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Pharma giant Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) ranks 7th in our list of the best starter stock portfolio picks. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has increased its dividend for over a decade now.Recently, Berenberg analyst Luisa Hector increased Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)’s price target to $130 from $125 and kept a Buy rating. The analyst believes Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has room to run after ""significant de-risking"" of the company's cardiovascular pipeline.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 77 hedge funds had stakes in Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), according to Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds.Artisan Value Fund made the following comment about Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a provider of health care solutions including prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, animal health and consumer care products. Shares have benefited from investors seeking safety in areas with less economic and interest rate sensitivity. With about one third of its sales generated by blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, the key issue for investors is the success of its large R&amp;D pipeline to replace those sales when Keytruda comes off patent in 2028. However, Merck seems to be getting little credit from investors for the 60+ programs it has in clinical development, despite having several solid and large new product opportunities. Additionally, the company’s strong balance sheet and robust free cash flow provide it multiple options for future partnerships and acquisitions, besides return of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.”6. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 79While Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) shares have seen a lot of see-saw movements this year, it remains one of the safest stocks for starters for several reasons. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is a solid dividend payer, and it is expected to continue seeing huge demand for oil in the years to come. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is also investing heavily in the clean energy sector to diversify its operations for the future. Its dominance in the industry gives it an edge over other, smaller players.Earlier this month, Mizuho increased its price target for Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) to $147 from $140 and kept a Buy rating on the stock. Click to continue reading and see Starter Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Stocks To Buy. Suggested articles:11 Most Promising Car Stocks to Buy11 Best Coal Mining Stocks to Buy TodayGraham Stephan Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock PicksDisclosure: None.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, or DJIA, is a stock market index that tracks 30 prominent American companies listed on the US stock exchanges. Year-to-date, the index is down 1.67% and returned 11.49% in the past six months, as of March 29. Some important Dow companies include Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).The companies that make up the DJIA are leaders in their respective industries and are considered to be representative of the overall performance of the U.S. stock market. The DJIA is often used as a benchmark for the performance of the U.S. stock market as a whole, and investors and analysts use it to track the performance of individual companies and to make investment decisions. The index has shown strong performance over the past years relative to its counterpart, the S&amp;P 500. According to a report by Forbes, the index delivered an average annual return of 16.65% in three years that ended in 2019, compared with a 14.03% annualized return on the S&amp;P 500. In our previous article, we shed light on the performance of both indexes and reported that the Dow has outperformed the wider market over the last 30 years that ended June 2021. During this period, the S&amp;P 500 delivered a 10.6% return, compared with an 11.16% return of the DJIA.In the current market situation, dividend stocks are gaining a lot of traction among investors as they try to generate stable and regular income. When it comes to dividend investing, companies that have proven dividend growth track records become popular because of their strong cash flow generation and solid balance sheets. Dividend growers also dominate the market, especially during periods of high turbulence. A report by Capital Group revealed the importance of dividend stocks and mentioned that they accounted for nearly one-third of the market’s total return from 1926 to 2021. The report also mentioned that dividend growers returned 9.3% to shareholders from 1990 to 2022, with a 14.5% volatility.

(NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is an Oregon-based multinational footwear manufacturing company that also manufactures apparel, equipment, and other related accessories. In fiscal Q3 2022, the company posted revenue of $12.4 billion, which showed a 14% growth from the same period last year. During the quarter, the company paid $528 million to shareholders in dividends, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are some other popular dividend stocks in DJIA.Following the company's recent quarterly earnings, Morgan Stanley maintained an Overweight rating on NIKE, Inc.

(NYSE:NKE) shares were a top contributor for 4Q as the company reported solid 2Q23 results and raised its annual guidance. Nike reported 17% revenue growth (27% on a currency neutral basis) and $0.85 EPS, both significantly greater than expectations. Management raised its F23 outlook to low teens currency-neutral revenue growth.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect gross and operating margin improvements as it shifts its product mix to more premium products and adopts a more direct to consumer approach, driving long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”10. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an American financial services company that specializes in payment cards.

The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74An American multinational consumer goods corporation, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”8. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a New York-based multinational investment banking company that also provides other financial services to its consumers. The company is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as it returned over $3.2 billion to shareholders in dividends.The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

(NYSE:GS), up from 69 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is roughly $5 billion.Here is what Manole Capital Management had to say about The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)7.

(NYSE:MRK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a provider of health care solutions including prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, animal health and consumer care products. Shares have benefited from investors seeking safety in areas with less economic and interest rate sensitivity. With about one third of its sales generated by blockbuster oncology drug Keytruda, the key issue for investors is the success of its large R&amp;D pipeline to replace those sales when Keytruda comes off patent in 2028. However, Merck seems to be getting little credit from investors for the 60+ programs it has in clinical development, despite having several solid and large new product opportunities. Additionally, the company’s strong balance sheet and robust free cash flow provide it multiple options for future partnerships and acquisitions, besides return of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.”6.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Oxford Industries OXM, BRP DOOO, MidAmerica Apartment Communities MAA and SL Green Realty SLG.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Stocks to Watch on Dividend Hikes Amid Recent Banking PlightU.S. investor sentiment is clouded with concerns over inflation, interest rates and the recent banking plight. In the past month, the Dow has lost 0.80%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have added 0.03% and 2.27%.The Consumer Price Index rose 0.4% in February and 6% from a year ago, mostly due to persistently higher rent followed by food and energy prices. Responding to the current scenario, the Fed, in its recent policy meeting, increased key interest rates by 25 basis points to meet its obligation against its inflation expectation of 2% in the long run.With this, the Fed has increased its benchmark overnight interest rate since last March by 475 basis points from the near-zero level to the current 4.75-5.00% range, the highest in 15 years.The banking collapse in the United States, which started with the Silicon Valley Bank, followed by Signature Bank and later on Credit Suisse, turned out to be the biggest since the financial crisis in 2008. The federal government had to step in to ensure depositors’ interest. The question now is whether the Fed has overstepped with its aggressive rate hike stances.The U.S. baking crisis has been felt beyond Wall Street in the United Kingdom, Europe and China. Also, the global energy crisis and supply-chain challenges remain major threats to business.Thus, investors looking for regular income and capital preservation can invest in mature businesses, which pay out regular dividends. Amid adverse economic conditions, these stocks remain profitable due to their proven business models.Story continuesCompanies, which tend to reward investors with a high dividend payout, outperform non-dividend-paying stocks during market volatility. Investors can expect a regular flow of income in volatile market conditions.On that note, let us look at companies like Oxford Industries, BRP, MidAmerica Apartment Communities and SL Green Realty, which have lately hiked their dividend payouts.Oxford Industries is an apparel company.

425,b54a7f66-ec3c-3c8f-8991-7efe5b53916c,PEP,2023-03-31,"Why PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) Looks Like A Quality Company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-pepsico-inc-nasdaq-pep-120024656.html,1680177624,STORY,['PEP'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PepsiCo is:52% = US$9.0b ÷ US$17b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.52 in profit.Does PepsiCo Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, PepsiCo has a superior ROE than the average (15%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 3 risks we have identified for PepsiCo by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesPepsiCo's Debt And Its 52% ROEPepsiCo clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.26. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: PepsiCo may not be the best stock to buy.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Amgen (AMGN) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $4.50 a share 27 days away from its upcoming earnings release on April 26, 2023.Amgen's Earnings ESP sits at 14.54%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.50 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.93.AMGN is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Quest Diagnostics (DGX).Slated to report earnings on April 20, 2023, Quest Diagnostics holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.99 a share 21 days from its next quarterly update.For Quest Diagnostics, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 is 0.54%.Story continuesAMGN and DGX's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Outside of work, Ned enjoys photography, hiking, and walking his three-legged dog, Nando.This blog is part of our People Behind Purpose at Cisco series that focuses on employees driving Cisco's purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All. Each blog highlights a different Cisco employee whose work positively impacts people, communities, or the planet. The series was formerly known as people behind Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) at Cisco.Cisco's Global Energy Management and Sustainability (GEMS) team is responsible for energy and sustainability initiatives across our global real estate portfolio with objectives to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Read more about our sustainability efforts in our real estate operations on Cisco's environmental, social and governance (ESG) Reporting Hub.Ned Bagno is on the GEMS team and manages the EnergyOps program, which focuses on identifying and implementing energy efficiency and onsite solar projects across our buildings worldwide. He shares more about his background and experience, and what he looks forward to in the future.Can you tell me a bit about your path to working at Cisco?Ned: Following my electronics teacher's advice in high school, I joined the US Navy because he told me they had an excellent electronics program. Working on shipboard electrical, electronic, and security systems prepared me for my future in the job market, where I specialized in building process control systems, mainly for manufacturing facilities. That evolved into specializing in troubleshooting and designing large corporate physical security systems.Later, I joined Cisco as a contractor in corporate security, and, after a short time, I became a full-time employee. I worked on high-visibility projects, like our Bangalore, India, campus security, earthquake early warning systems in San Jose, California, and the corporate security command center in one of our San Jose campus buildings, to name a few.Story continuesI joined Cisco's GEMS team ten years ago. At the time, we were setting our previous Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction goals. Over the next five years, I managed two tracks of our EnergyOps program, and, in 2017, I began managing the entire program.Can you explain what the EnergyOps program does?Ned: EnergyOps is our program to reduce the environmental impact of our facilities. Our approach to reducing GHG emissions associated with our real estate is to increase the energy efficiency of our buildings, while investing in renewable energy. This combined approach has allowed us to avoid increases in overall building energy consumption, despite increases in lab loads and equipment energy consumption, while reducing carbon emissions associated with our real estate.Through the EnergyOps program and our investments in renewable energy, we were able to achieve (one year early) our previous goal to reduce Cisco's total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions worldwide by 60% absolute by fiscal year (FY) 2022 (compared to a FY 2007 base year). These successes also provided a foundation on which to set our current broader net-zero goal and near-term targets. [1]What kind of projects do you do?We've completed hundreds of projects, from simple retrofits to extensive equipment replacements. We typically purchase or lease existing buildings rather than build new ones, so, there are often energy efficiency opportunities in our building portfolio. We also advise our broader real estate team on energy-efficient options when we update our buildings or when equipment is replaced.We begin the project development process by performing detailed analyses to understand how the building system is operating, and to identify opportunities to improve efficiency. Through our analyses, we find areas where we can make changes, such as adjusting building setpoints for optimal efficiency, or adding variable frequency drives that adjust to the current equipment load and consume less energy. Other types of projects we pursue are energy-efficient upgrades to lighting systems and large mechanical equipment, such as chillers and boilers. We've installed economizers that use outside air to help cool our buildings when outdoor temperatures permit. Additionally, we have installed cold/hot air containment systems that help manage heat and reduce hot spots in our energy-intensive labs and data centers.Our projects also help us pursue green building certifications at our sites, such as U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and the WELL Building Standard.Favorite projects you worked on over the last year?I'm working on an Artificial Intelligence (AI) project at our Allen, Texas, data center. The objective of the project is to use AI to better understand how the existing building automation system operates and to optimize its sequence of operations. This project is estimated to reduce energy consumption in the chiller plant by more than 30%. There's definitely a learning curve for the humans using the AI as well!Another interesting installation was a chiller and ice storage project we completed at our campus in Ottawa, Canada. During the project, we replaced the entire cooling plant and added numerous ice-storage tanks. The system makes ice at night when energy is both lower cost and less carbon intensive. During the day, we use the ice, instead of the chillers, to cool the building and our data center for 6+ hours a day. This project helps us save money, reduces our carbon footprint and reduces strain on the local electric grid. We're now looking at replicating this innovative project and design at a few of our other locations.What's next for the GEMS team and the EnergyOps program?We're very focused on making progress towards our FY 2025 Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction goal. We plan to invest approximately US$39 million from FY 2023 to FY 2025 in three areas: energy efficiency, renewable energy, and electrification. Over the next few years, we hope to convert many of our natural gas heating systems to electric and install new onsite solar photovoltaic (PV) systems at several campuses. We also plan to expand our investment in offsite renewable energy by executing over 500 megawatts (MW) of new, long-term renewable energy contracts by the end of FY 2025.We're excited to continue our work, knowing that our efforts contribute towards Cisco's purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All.[1] Cisco has set a goal to reach net zero across its value chain (Scopes 1, 2, and 3) by 2040. Our net-zero goal includes two near-term targets:To reduce absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 90% and neutralizing any remaining emissions by removing an equal amount from the atmosphere by FY 2025 compared to our 2019 FY;To reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services, upstream transportation and distribution, and use of sold products 30% by FY 2030 compared to our 2019 FY.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/746693/People-Behind-Purpose-at-Cisco-Reducing-the-Environmental-Impacts-of-Our-Facilities-Through-the-EnergyOps-Program]"
