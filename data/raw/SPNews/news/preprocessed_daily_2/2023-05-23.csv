0,68e21455-2b5a-36c4-9f45-0abbba412487,VRSK,2023-05-23,Verisk Analytics' (NASDAQ:VRSK) investors will be pleased with their splendid 112% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verisk-analytics-nasdaq-vrsk-investors-120018113.html,1684843218,STORY,['VRSK'],"[When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. Long term Verisk Analytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSK) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 106% in five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 25% gain in the last three months. The company reported its financial results recently; you can catch up on the latest numbers by reading our company report.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Verisk Analytics To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Verisk Analytics achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 8.0% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 16% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. This free interactive report on Verisk Analytics' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Verisk Analytics' TSR for the last 5 years was 112%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Verisk Analytics shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 29% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 16% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Verisk Analytics better, we need to consider many other factors.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Now.The basic materials industry is huge and includes major segments like oil, metals &amp; mining, chemicals, and other raw materials. The industry often remains in flux amid changing oil and commodity prices. Oil companies account for a major chunk of the basic materials industry. Major oil stocks like ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum are trading in the red this year amid fears of a slowing economy and recession. This lackluster performance of oil companies comes after a huge outperformance of the energy sector last year.Pessimism Around ChinaThe biggest factor that is denting the performance of many energy and commodities companies this year is the pessimism surrounding Chinese economic growth. Earlier this year the market cheered the reopening of China. The world was expecting the demand for commodities to surge as Chinese factories and industries fire up. But the economic growth in China remains slower than expected.For April, China’s indicator of manufacturing activity declined to 49.2 from the previous month’s 51.9 reading. On April 25, copper prices fell to their five-week lows after data indicated a slower-than-expected rebound in activity in China and rising inventors at the London Metal Exchange warehouse system.Talking about the reopening dynamics in China and how it’s affecting iron ore, steel prices and related business of the company, Vale’s management said the following in its latest earnings call:""So we’ve been seeing the recovery in China. Definitely we have strong numbers. You mentioned that GDP FAI very resilient, infrastructure investment properties, we have good news also. So the bright side that we are in the stocking mall in China. So, we see the sales increasing also the accomplishment of construction also increase. You mentioned all the micro numbers, blast furnace going well, we just came from China. It’s a common sense that production will be flat this year. So the production is there. So what is concerning today, so, the first thing is related to property. It is a cycle. So we firstly we need to sell, finish the construction. So land sales and new starts are coming.So that didn’t come yet. So that’s the main volatility that we see in our — even in our clients. They are in a wait and see mode. But everybody’s waiting that for only for the second half. So we are on track and we need to wait for that. I think price in steel, it’s another concern. But the good news is, if you see the export that you had in China, this quarter. That implies that we have a symmetry in the price, ex-China comparing to China. So there is a wind that can help China to improve the price in the steel market. And as a combination of all of this, we have a tepid or really tepid margins steel mill. So with all this, we have this wait and see behavior, we have old inventors are really low. So in our perspective in short-term, we can see a rebound, we have this next holiday that is coming out and they will need to replenish the supply chain.""Story continuesBut as the Federal Reserve mulls a pause on rate hikes, the economy might get back to normal, giving a boost to the materials sector. In December, Goldman Sachs predicted that commodities could give investors over 40% returns in 2023. The firm at the time said that it was expecting the first quarter to be “bumpy” for the sector amid weakness in China and the US. However, the firm was expecting the sector to benefit from the shortage of commodities after the first quarter.Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Shane Cottle on UnsplashMethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked 13 basic materials stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

So that was part of the impact. The other thing you would see in silicones was that, pricing and demand held up relatively well. Some pressure downward on siloxanes pricing in China from new capacity additions there. But I think we’re starting to see that the demand is picking up and that should help smooth things out. So you also saw higher net sales in coatings and monomers and also higher volumes. Some of its supply availability, as I mentioned in silicones and siloxanes, the other is getting ready for seasonally higher volumes going into the second quarter.And then we think we’ll see more of a traditional seasonal pickup in the coatings and monomers segment. Some pressure on architectural coatings, but industrial coatings are looking relatively strong. And I think we’ll have to watch carefully what’s going on with housing starts and housing sales and see how that impacts architectural coatings through the quarter."" Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested articles:10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Fast Food Stocks to Invest In15 Most Tax-Friendly Countries in EuropeDisclosure: None. 13 Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
6,7d9255b1-3bf2-365a-9602-aac15a4c19cc,NUE,2023-05-23,What Makes ArcelorMittal (MT) Stock a Solid Choice Right Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-arcelormittal-mt-stock-solid-121600058.html,1684757760,STORY,"['MT.AS', 'MT', 'NUE', 'PPG', 'LIN']","[ArcelorMittal’s MT stock looks promising at the moment. The company is expected to benefit from improved market conditions, expansion moves and cost-improvement actions. We are positive on the company’s prospects and believe that the time is right for you to add the stock to portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.ArcelorMittal has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best investment opportunities for investors.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that make this steel giant an attractive choice for investors right now.Estimates NorthboundOver the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ArcelorMittal for 2023 has increased around 37.5%. The consensus estimate for 2024 has also been revised 7.8% upward over the same time frame. The favorable estimate revisions instill investor confidence in the stock.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryArcelorMittal’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 99.8%.Valuation Looks AttractiveArcelorMittal’s shares are currently trading at a level that is lower than the industry average, suggesting that the stock still has upside potential.Going by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, which is often used to value steel stocks, ArcelorMittal is currently trading at trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 2.37, cheaper compared with the industry average of 6.07.Growth Drivers in PlaceArcelorMittal is expected to benefit from improved demand conditions in 2023 following aggressive destocking. Apparent demand conditions improved once the destocking phase reached its maturity in the first quarter of 2023. The company stated that the absence of further destocking is likely to maintain stronger apparent demand in 2023 compared to 2022. It sees world apparent steel consumption, excluding China, to rise by 2-3% year over year in 2023. ArcelorMittal also expects its steel shipments to grow by roughly 5% year over year in 2023.Moreover, the company is expanding its steel-making capacity and remains focused on shifting to high-added-value products. As part of this move, ArcelorMittal is expanding its automotive steel line of products. The company is expanding its global portfolio of automotive steels by launching a new generation of advanced high-strength steelsThe company’s cost-improvement initiatives will also support profitability. MT, in 2022, set out a new value plan worth $1.5 billion to maintain cost position, to be achieved over three years. The plan is focused on creating value through commercial and operational improvements. These include volume, mix and variable cost improvement. The company realized improvements of $0.4 billion from actions taken in 2022.The recent acquisition of Companhia Siderurgica do Pecem (“CSP”) in Brazil also brings the opportunity for further expansions, including the potential to boost primary steelmaking capacity (including direct reduced iron) and rolling and finishing capacity. Moreover, it offers significant operational and financial synergies. Given its location, CSP also offers an opportunity to establish a new center for producing low-carbon steel, capitalizing on the state of Ceara's desire to establish a low-cost, green hydrogen hub in Pecem.Story continues ArcelorMittal Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseArcelorMittal Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseArcelorMittal price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | ArcelorMittal Quote Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include Nucor Corporation NUE, PPG Industries, Inc.

CRI has been reeling under macroeconomic pressures, such as inflation and currency translation, for a while now. Due to this, demand from both retail and wholesale consumers decreased in the first quarter of 2023. However, the business is well-positioned to reap rewards in the future owing to its focus on e-commerce and online sales.E-commerce Remains High-Margin BusinessCarter’s is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its e-commerce capabilities and speed up deliveries through investments. The company’s solid e-commerce business continued in first-quarter 2023, driven by expanded omnichannel facilities, including curbside pickup, same-day pickup, buy online and pickup at store and shipping from store.This, along with easy access to a broad array of online products when shopping in stores, bodes well. Also, e-commerce continues to be one of its highest-margin businesses. Notably, sales on the company’s app have grown to represent about 1/4 of all U.S. e-commerce sales. Strength in its loyalty and private label credit card programs also bodes well.Carter’s has the highest rated online platform for young children's apparel. The company is focused on opening high-traffic centers that provide convenience for online shoppers and enable the same-day pickup of digital purchases. CRI’s mobile app is also performing well.Management continues to enhance its app with current efforts focused on building more sophisticated personalization capabilities. Carter’s is also testing same-day delivery with Shipt, a first-of-its-type collaboration in young children's apparel.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInflation, Y/Y Comparison Pose as HeadwindsCarter’s has been facing headwinds that is denting the company’s margins for a while now. Despite the earnings and sales beat in first-quarter 2023, both metrics fell year over year.Results were hurt by tough year-over-year comparisons, along with the impact of inflation. As a result, the company gave a bleak view for 2023. It expects net sales of $3 billion compared with $3.20 billion in the previous year. Also, it expects bottom line to decline year over year in 2023.Story continuesWrapping UpAlthough inflation impacts remain concerning in the near term, we believe that solid online show and recovery in consumer confidence and market conditions will aid this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

11,b856cb2b-2459-37c9-b2ea-1d8c2f7f4966,TMO,2023-05-23,‘Don’t Miss the Next Bull Market’: Billionaire Ken Fisher Stays Heavily Invested in These 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-miss-next-bull-141748117.html,1684765068,STORY,"['TSM', 'TMO']","[Ken FisherAfter the bear market of 2022, the markets have made a recovery in 2023, with both the S&amp;P 500 and, in particular, the NASDAQ showing healthy year-to-date gains. Therefore, it might be a natural instinct for investors who have nursed heavy losses to be eyeing the exit gate now that the market is rebalancing and the initial investment is back to breaking even. However, legendary investor Ken Fisher says that kind of thinking is a big mistake.“As initial bull market rallies build, investors — raw from the prior drop — sell. It feels smart,” says Fisher. But it’s the wrong move.While There might be many bears prowling Wall Street right now, according to Fisher, the pendulum has already swung the other way and we are in the early innings of a bull market. The key, now, is to stay in the game. “While many will suffer breakevenitis, you can avoid it — by keeping long-term goals top of mind,” says the billionaire.Putting his money where his mouth is, Fisher is staying fully invested. We’ve opened the TipRanks database to see what the Street’s stock experts make of a pair of equities that form part of his portfolio. It looks like they agree these are sound choices; both are rated ‘Strong Buys’ by the analyst consensus. Let’s see why they are worth leaning into right now.Thermo Fisher (TMO)The first Fisher-backed name we’ll look at is a giant in its field. Boasting a market capitalization of over $203 billion, Thermo Fisher is one of the world’s most prominent healthcare suppliers. The company provides a wide range of scientific solutions, including analytical instruments, consumables, reagents, software, and services. It caters to a diverse customer base that includes pharmaceutical and biotech companies, academic and research institutions, hospitals and clinical diagnostic labs, as well as government agenciesDespite being a major global concern, TMO is not immune to the changes happening around it. The company’s recent Q1 report reflects the impact of Covid-19, with testing revenue falling from $1.7 billion in the same period a year ago to $140 million. As a result, revenue dropped by 9.4% year-over-year to $10.71 billion, although it exceeded the Street’s forecast by $40 million. On the other hand, the adjusted EPS of $5.03 met the analysts’ expectations. TMO also maintained its guidance for 2023, anticipating revenue of $45.3 billion and EPS of $23.70.Story continuesFisher is evidently keen on this healthcare giant. He holds a big TMO position, owning 2,395,840 shares. These are currently worth over $1.26 billion.It’s an act that most likely gets the approval of Stifel analyst Daniel Arias. Assessing the Q1 print and outlook, Arias wrote, “We expect the debate on demand risk to continue going forward, but for us TMO is differentiating itself in a way that advertises the company’s strengths (portfolio diversity, execution quality, share gain opportunity). So while some investors seem poised to avoid bioprocess related names (or Tools companies in general) for a bit until the temperature in the room cools, we continue to believe that TMO at 20x is highly attractive for those with a somewhat higher risk tolerance.”These comments underpin Arias’ Buy rating while his Street-high $700 price target suggests the shares will climb 33% higher over the coming months. (To watch Arias’ track record, click here)None of Arias’ colleagues appear to have an issue with that take. All 9 recent reviews are positive, naturally making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. Going by the $643.89 average target, the shares will deliver returns of ~21% in the year ahead. (See TMO stock forecast)Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)For our next Fisher-endorsed name, we will shift our focus from one industry giant to another segment leader. Taiwan Semiconductor is a leading global semiconductor manufacturer. Since its founding in 1987, the company has emerged as a key player in the semiconductor industry, specializing in the production of advanced integrated circuits (ICs) and system-on-chip (SoC) solutions. As the world’s largest dedicated semiconductor foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor is contracted by firms such as Apple, AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm to manufacture chips. With such prominent clients, it is no surprise that this mega-cap company boasts a market capitalization of $450 billion.That said, as has been evident at other huge tech companies, the global economic slowdown has affected TSM too. In the most recent quarterly report, the company delivered a mixed statement. Citing “softening end-market demand,” revenue dropped by 4.8% year-over-year to $16.72 billion, in turn missing the consensus estimate by $170 million. However, earnings of $1.31 per share trumped the $1.20 forecast.For the second quarter, revenue is anticipated in the range between $15.2 and $16 billion, some way off the $18.16 billion generated in the same period a year ago, although the company said that by Q3, it expects inventories to return to a “more healthy level.”Meanwhile, Fisher is going nowhere. The billionaire holds a sizeable TSM position, with the ownership of 25,228,676 shares. These currently command a market value of $2.33 billion.For Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini, it’s clear where TSM’s value proposition lies. “TSM, in our view, remains the preferred foundry choice for leading-edge nodes as Samsung Foundry has yet to demonstrate a stable leading edge process technology, all while IFS is years away from offering a competitive solution,” the 5-star analyst explained. “It’s no wonder large customers rely on TSM as a sole-source foundry partner. Given… the inherent leverage in TSM’s business model, we argue the risk/ reward profile is favorable as quarterly EPS bottoms in 2Q23, followed by a rebound into 2H23 and gaining momentum in 2024.”Accordingly, Hosseini rates TSM shares as Positive (i.e., Buy) and backs the rating up with a $126 price target. The implication for investors? Potetnial upside of 36% from current levels. (To watch Hosseini’s track record, click here)Three other analysts have waded in with TSM reviews recently, and they are all singing the company’s praises, providing the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for one-year gains of 29%, considering the average target stands at $118.67.

These are the first and only immunoassays to receive breakthrough designation and clearance for the risk assessment and clinical management of preeclampsia, a severe pregnancy complication.The recent development is likely to have a significant impact on the prognosis and treatment of thousands of women at risk for preeclampsia every year in the United States.Significance of the Biomarker TestsPreeclampsia is known to be the leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Over the last decade, the incident rates of this life-threatening blood pressure disorder have increased rapidly in the United States.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchB·R·A·H·M·S sFlt-1 KRYPTOR and B·R·A·H·M·S PlGF plus KRYPTOR assays are designed to be used along with other laboratory tests and clinical assessments to determine the risks of pregnant women who have been hospitalized for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The assays run on the Thermo Scientific B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR compact PLUS clinical chemistry analyzer.The PRAECIS (Preeclampsia Risk Assessment: Evaluation of Cut-offs to Improve Stratification) study validates that novel biomarkers aid in detecting the development of severe preeclampsia. Based on the risk stratification ratio of the two assays, women who tested positive will receive enhanced surveillance and accelerated care before severe features develop.Thermo Fisher is focused on advancing diagnostic solutions for reproductive health as part of the broader mission to enable its customers to make a healthier and safer world. Following the FDA clearance, the availability of these novel biomarker tests will allow caregivers across the United States to better manage and potentially improve outcomes for both mothers and their newborns.Industry ProspectsPer a Research report, the global preeclampsia diagnostics market size was valued at $1.03 billion in 2021 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.2% up to 2029.Story continuesRecent DevelopmentsIn May 2023, Thermo Fisher collaborated with Pfizer to expand next-generation sequencing-based testing capabilities in more than 30 countries across Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia, where access to affordable advanced genomic testing has been previously limited or unavailable.In March 2023, Thermo Fisher announced a strategic collaboration with Arsenal Biosciences, Inc. The aim is to enable the latter to develop a robust manufacturing process for next-generation, programmable autologous T cells for the treatment of cancer.Price PerformanceIn the past six months, Thermo Fisher has mostly underperformed its industry.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.U.S. Bancorp in FocusBased in Minneapolis, U.S. Bancorp (USB) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -30.96%. The company is paying out a dividend of $0.48 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 6.38% compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 4.67% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.75%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.92 is up 2.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, U.S. Bancorp has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.47%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, U.S. Bancorp's payout ratio is 41%, which means it paid out 41% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.USB is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.59 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 3.15%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, USB is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For more stocks, head on over to Bill Gates' Most Recent Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Today's age is the information age. If you have a smartphone and an internet connection, you can look up vast amounts of information sufficient to form an informed opinion on a variety of topics. One such topic is global wealth, and one of the most well known billionaires ever since the growth of the internet is Bill Gates.Mr. Gates, responsible for setting up one of the world's largest technology companies, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), has dominated the global rich list for several years. Bill Gates was the first person in human history to cross $100 billion in total worth, during the peak of the dotcom era as Microsoft's shares boomed during the peak of the bubble. Mr. Gates first made it on Forbes' billionaire list in 1987 and became the world's richest person in 1995. This kicked off a period of dominance by Mr. Gates, as he maintained that spot until 2008 when he lost the title to the Mexican business tycoon Carlos Slim. This would be a short lived victory for Mr. Slim, as the Microsoft billionaire would retake the top spot a year later and maintain the position until 2010 to lose the title once again for three years and regain it in 2017. Gates only lost the richest person title after he donated $55 billion of his wealth to the Gates Foundation. Safe to say, for Mr. Gates, being the world's richest person is as normal as filing taxes for the rest of us.These days, Bill Gates is the sixth richest person in the world, and by our estimates, he really couldn't care less. His net worth, according to Forbes Magazine, is $114 billion, and according to the magazine's estimates, $30 billion of this fortune is held in cash. Quite a sizeable bank balance, we'd say. While the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is one of the best known investment vehicles for Mr. Gates, the billionaire also runs his family office called Cascade Investment. Cascade is also managed by the Gates Foundation's manager Michael Larson. Mr. Gates is the only owner of Cascade, and the firm's SEC filings reveal investments in a variety of firms such as AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO), Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL), Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI), and Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE).Story continuesThe foundation of Bill Gates' wealth is built on software. His firm Microsoft is the largest company in the world in terms of market share of the personal computing operating systems market. He has seen the computing industry since its inception, and naturally, this provides him with a unique perspective and insight into the industry. Given the current hype surrounding artificial intelligence, it's relevant to see his take on the matter. Fortunately for us, Mr. Gates shared his thoughts on the matter in March 2023 Microsoft podcast where he outlined:A.I. has always been the holy grail of computer science. And, when I was young, Stanford Research had Shaky the Robot that was trying to pick things up. There were various logic systems that people were working on. You know so the dream was always some sort of reasoning capability. Overall progress in A.I., until machine learning came along, So was pretty modest. Even speech recognition was just barely reasonable. So we had that gigantic acceleration with machine learning particularly in sort of sensory things, recognizing speech, recognizing pictures. And it was phenomenal. And it just, you know kept getting better and scale was part of that. But we were still missing anything that had to do with complex logic. With being able to say read a text, and do what a human does, which is quote and understand what's in that text. And so as Microsoft was doing more with Open AI, I had a chance to go see them myself independently a number of times. They were doing a lot of text generation, they had a robot arm. The early text generation still didn't seem to have a broad understanding, you know like it could generate a sentence saying Joe's in Chicago, and then two sentences later say Joe's in Seattle which its local probabilistic sense was a good sentence but a human has a broad understanding of the world from both experience and reading. That you understand, that can't be. So they were enthusing about GPT-3 and even the early versions of GPT-4, I said to them, 'hey, if you can pass an advanced placement biology exam, where you take a question that's not part of the training set, or a bunch of them, and give fully reasoned answers knowing that biology textbook is one of many things that's in that training corps, then you will really get my attention because that would be a heck of a milestone. So, you know, please work on that.' I thought you know that would, they'd go away for two or three years. Because my intuition has always been we needed to understand knowledge representation and symbolic reasoning in a more explicit way. So that we were one or two inventions short of something where it was very good at reading and writing. And therefore being an assistant and so it was amazing that [they] over the summer were saying, yeah it might not be that long before we're going to come demo this thing to you because it's actually doing pretty well on scientific learning.So, with these details in mind, let's take a look at Bill Gates' top stock picks for 2023 out of which the biggest stakes are in Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).Bill Gates' Most Recent Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned the Q1'2023 portfolio of Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and picked the top 15 stocks in terms of stake value.Bill Gates' Most Recent Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks15.

Elsewhere, investors will be watching the release of fresh data on activity in the American service and manufacturing sectors, while Lowe's prepares to unveil its latest results as the quarterly corporate earnings season begins to ebb.1. 'Productive, not progress'The scramble in Washington to reach a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling has intensified after a crucial meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy failed to produce an agreement.Biden said the discussions on Monday were ""productive,"" but McCarthy said ""no progress"" was made in breaking the impasse. Both sides remain at odds over spending plans, although Biden and McCarthy were optimistic that they will eventually find a path toward lifting the $31.4 trillion borrowing limit.However, McCarthy has flagged that a deal needs to be hashed out this week in order to give Congress time to vote on it before the U.S. crashes into a damaging and unprecedented default.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has reiterated that the federal government could run out of money to pay its bills as soon as June 1. Investors are nervous that this could create ripple effects through global markets.2. Futures volatile amid debt limit talksU.S. stock futures were mixed in choppy trading on Tuesday as investors digested comments from Democrats and Republicans on the debt limit negotiations.At 04:54 ET (08:54 GMT), the Dow futures contract moved down 44 points or 0.13%, S&amp;P 500 futures lost 3 points or 0.07%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 1 point or 0.01%.The main indices ended the trading day on Monday muted, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipping by 0.42% and the benchmark S&amp;P 500 inching only 0.02% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also gained 0.50%.3. U.S. PMI data aheadTraders today will also be keeping an eye on the release of the monthly U.S. purchasing managers' index, which is expected to provide insight into how elevated interest rates are impacting the performance of the country's service and manufacturing sectors.Story continuesThe preliminary PMI reading is projected to show that activity in both industries slowed in May, although the figure for services - a major portion of the world's largest economy - is projected to remain in expansion territory.Meanwhile, the PMI number for manufacturing is seen touching the 50-mark exactly, a level that denotes neither growth nor contraction.Elsewhere on the economic calendar, data for new home sales is also due out, with economists estimating that the amount of new single-family properties sold in April dipped compared to the prior month.4. Lowe's on deck as first-quarter earnings season winds downHome improvement chain Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) is set to release its first-quarter results before the start of U.S. trading on Tuesday, headlining a waning stream of U.S. corporate earnings.Lowe's latest returns are expected to shed more light on the health of the U.S. consumer following a string of numbers from other brand-name retailers last week.Rival Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and big-box group Target (NYSE:TGT) were both hit by cost-of-living pressures that convinced more shoppers to rein in spending on high-priced discretionary items. Home Depot saw three-month sales drop 4.2%, while quarterly comparable sales at Target were flat.However, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) posted a stronger-than-anticipated revenue bump and raised its financial outlook. The megachain known for its low-cost offerings was buoyed by solid demand for groceries, a sign that demand is shifting to essential items as inflation eats into customers' wallets.Other retailers reporting on Tuesday include sports equipment seller Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) and kitchenware business Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM).5. Crude prices slip into the redOil prices moved slightly lower on Tuesday, paring back earlier gains, with the ongoing uncertainty around the debt ceiling talks denting risk sentiment even as the start of the U.S. driving season edges closer.At 04:22 ET, U.S. crude futures inched down by 0.12% at $71.96 per barrel, while the Brent contract slipped by 0.10% to $75.89 a barrel.U.S. fuel consumption is set to pick up with the start of the summer season, which is usually marked by the upcoming Memorial Day weekend at the end of May. This, coupled with disruptions in Canadian supply due to wildfires in the oil-rich Alberta province, has suggested that oil markets may be tighter in the coming months.Related ArticlesDebt ceiling meeting, U.S. PMIs, Lowe's reports - what's moving marketsGreece on track for new vote with leftists unable to form coalitionIMF says UK is no longer heading for a recession in 2023]"

Discovery: Stocks to watch",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ai-amazon-walmart-warner-bros-221811101.html,1684793891,VIDEO,"['WBD', 'AMZN', 'WMT']","[The Yahoo Finance Live team discusses the risks of AI and misinformation, Amazon One launching an age verification method for alcohol sales using one's hand, Walmart+ members access to pet telehealth, and Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav being booed at Boston University's graduation ceremony.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Let's take a look at some of the trending stories of the day. Up first, a fake image of an explosion near the Pentagon set off a brief panic today, momentarily causing the markets to dip during the morning session. The image in question was first posted on Twitter showing black smoke billowing near the Pentagon with the text reports of an explosion.That image was promptly shared by a handful of accounts, including Russia's state-controlled media RT and an account claiming to belong to Bloomberg. That prompted the Arlington Fire Department to put out this tweet saying that there is no explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon. And there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public.Guys, you know, we, kind of, followed this in real time. And it really does point to two key things that we talk a lot about on the show. Number one, what this paid to verify environment looks like on Twitter today because the account that shared this did have a blue check mark. Because remember, today, it's not about verification. It's about paying to get verified.The other bit though is, I would argue, a little more concerning, which is all indications are that this was an AI-generated image. This was not checked when it was shared on Twitter. And that raises a lot of questions about how quickly misinformation can move. And to be clear, we're not sharing the image because we don't want to add to that. But it certainly demonstrated that the fears that people have about how AI could be misused.SEANA SMITH: It does. And it also strengthens the arguments that we've heard from Elon Musk, from Steve Wozniak, and the like saying that maybe we should pause the development of AI given the fact that there are so many concerns about misinformation and how quickly that can spread online. But, Akiko, you bring up a great point.Story continuesAnd it's also what I wanted to make. When it comes to the future of Twitter and whether or not people are going to rely on Twitter as much as they had been previously, given the fact that there's lots of questions out there about the actual source of the account, whether or not a blue check-- and, obviously, it doesn't. But it's not well known at least just yet that people can't necessarily trust someone with a blue check mark account because you can, obviously, just pay to get that blue check mark.So I think this is also going to, kind of, recalibrate a little bit of how people go and get their news, how much they're trusting Twitter. And also just brings up a lot of questions about the future of AI, what that exactly looks like, and why maybe this strengthens the argument for regulation. And the quicker-- the fastest that we could get regulation, why that's so necessary, given all the risks that are on the table right now.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And on that point about Twitter, what if the Arlington Fire Department, what if that was a fake account that was created and said--SEANA SMITH: Yeah.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --this is real. And that could even have more dire consequences. We saw the S&amp;P 500 dip on the heels of this news. So this has serious, serious consequences if left unchecked. I think verification for both accounts and also these deepfakes, any manipulated photos or videos, that needs to be paramount.I don't know if there's more technology-- obviously, there is-- that needs to be developed and be embedded in the Twitter platform. But like Seana has said, and, Akiko, like you said, I do think this raises serious questions about the future of Twitter and even for our business in media in journalism. We need to make sure that these things are verified before we say anything and potentially spread this misinformation.ALLIE GARFINKLE: I have to say, guys, for me, this felt kind of like a visceral gut punch. I actually had a-- an emotional experience seeing the story. And partially, that's simply because in the end, AI is really difficult to discern. It makes it difficult to discern what is true and what is not.And one of the most concerning things to me actually was not the Twitter stuff. It was the fact that it was also circulating on Google. And it-- it's just a sharp reminder of the fact that our definition for misinformation, we imagine text, but we have to define that as to images. You can't always trust what you see, which is really scary.AKIKO FUJITA: And, Allie, you know, worth noting that those who are very in the weeds on forensic. You know, forensics of these digital images do point out that there's ways to decipher whether, in fact, something is an AI-generated image or not, specifically Bellingcat. Of course, we know them as this investigative outlet.They say-- one of the reporters that you could tell by the way the fence melt into the crowd barriers-- that's the number one-- that shows you that's not a real image. But also, look to see what other images are being shared. In this case, it was the exact same image that was shared. And that's usually a red flag, that it's not a real event that's happening. Or the image is not real.ALLIE GARFINKLE: And we will, I think, get better at time by-- in terms of distinguishing what's real, what's not. But the tech will also-- the tech will also get better. On the subject of tech getting better, my play here is Amazon. Amaz always-- Amazon's always got something new. And today, it's paying for alcohol by swiping your hand.This announcement is an expansion of the company's Amazon One service, which is a palm reading frictionless payment option that they've rolled out in several retail locations like, for instance, Amazon Fresh stores. I've got to say, though, even though Amazone One was launched in 2020, this seems to be a statement of confidence to me about the technology itself.Alcohol, of course, is highly regulated. And there's far less margin for error with alcohol than, say, a box of Special K. However, we could see some pushback here for digital privacy advocates. Amazon One has absolutely been a target.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Look, I love anything that makes it easy for me. Personally, when I go to the subway and I can whip out my phone and just tap and get right on the train, that's a win in my book. I am a little concerned with all of the intense advancements when we think about biometric tracking. Now, Amazon does argue that the palm is more private than perhaps your eyes or a fingerprint.But that gets me a little worried in terms of privacy. But ultimately, if my privacy can be contained and I just have to go like this to get a bottle of wine or Ketel One, I mean, I do think it makes it much more efficient. And I think we're going to see more of this technology moving forward, in my opinion.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I think Amazon's, obviously, making the case that you should trust their handling of your data, why you should not be concerned about what, in fact, could potentially get out there. But I am. As a consumer, it does make me think twice.I am going to be one of those ones, if I were to ever travel, to [INAUDIBLE] where this is going to be available first. If I'm given the option, you have to sign up for it. There's a number of things that you have to submit and several pieces of information in order to qualify for this.But I am going to think twice. I'm going to let some other people experiment with it first and make sure that their data is not leaked, nothing bad happens to them. And then I will jump on board. I'm not doubting that this is the future. I think, obviously, Amazon is the leader when it comes to this space.But it is a little worrisome in terms of your own data getting out there but also, just how much data, Akiko, Amazon has on you there. Already, I feel like have so many aspects of my life covered. This is just one more data point that they will not have, which is a little unnerving.AKIKO FUJITA: To which I respond, Seana, by saying how much data do you have on this, right?SEANA SMITH: So much. I--AKIKO FUJITA: I mean--SEANA SMITH: --exactly, make a big one.AKIKO FUJITA: --they have my face. They have my thumbprint. They have everything. And I'm with you, Allie. Whatever makes it easier, I have a tendency to move in that direction. There is initial hesitation. But I will say from Amazon's perspective, what does it mean?Well, it means that they can target their products. Their ads can be targeted even more because they've got more data on you. From a business standpoint, it's what they're looking for.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, it gives them a huge advantage that-- potentially. That's for sure. All right, well, my play today is the Walmart. The retail giant going after pet owners with a new perk. So get this, Walmart+ members will now have access to pet telehealth. This is through a partnership with provider Pop.Now, it's the company's latest move to better compete with Amazon, which has a very similar offering, and also deepen its customer loyalty. And it could potentially pay off here. We've talked about this a lot in the past, the pet industry long being viewed as recession resistant. And we know Americans have been spending big bucks when it comes to their pets. It's a very fast-growing sector-- right now, right around $123 billion.Well, that market is expected to grow all the way to $200 billion by 2030. My question, though, I get telehealth when it comes to humans. For pets, I think it's going to be very complicated for veterinarian to try and figure out what is wrong with your pet without bringing them into the office and being able to do some tests.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Seana, I got very personal here. I wanted to know if my-- my little brother, he has a dog, Theo. I'm going to show a video. This video was not created by my brother but my father. So this is the grand--ALLIE GARFINKLE: Oh.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --doggie. And I just wanted to show this to show how intense pet owners are. This is little Theo. I said to my family-- I said, would you sign up for Walmart+ if they had the free telehealth visits incorporated? My mom immediately goes, wow, that's great. I'm going to sign up for Walmart+ right now.My brother, who is 27, younger, he questioned it. He said, I don't know if that alone would make me sign up for this service. He was more enticed by the free streaming services, the discounts on gas, the delivery. Because he said, if I had a real issue with my dog, I would go in person to the vet. Or I would email them pictures. He didn't quite see the value of telehealth.But I think, again, to my mom's point, that older generation, they hear that. And people love their dogs so much. Your initial reaction is to say, heck, yes, I'm signing up for this.AKIKO FUJITA: I just want to know how effective it is. Seana, my-- the question you--SEANA SMITH: Yeah.AKIKO FUJITA: --asked is the number one question I had. How do you know on telehealth how your dog is doing? That's what I want to know. How does that service work?SEANA SMITH: I have no idea. But I'm also-- I don't own a pet. But just as a bystander here, if someone's pet was hurt, I would want them to take it into the veterinary just so they could get a better scope, a better idea of what the heck was going on rather than just relying on video when the dog can't talk. Cat can't talk, obviously.ALLIE GARFINKLE: Well, the other thing about this too is-- I actually took the same tack as Allie. And I asked my mom. I said, OK, mom, would you use this? And she was sitting at canasta with a group of dog moms in Miami. And lo and behold, they all said, absolutely, I would love that. So, Allie-- I mean, older generation--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Your mom.ALLIE GARFINKLE: --seems to be on it.ALEXANDRA CANAL: They seem to be on it. And, you know, when we're talking about pets, David Zaslav, CEO of Warner Brothers Discovery, he's not a teacher's pet, at least not at BU. Here's why. Take a look at this.- I have the honor to present David Zaslav for Boston University's honorary degree.[BOOING][APPLAUSE]- David Zaslav, you are a lawyer, executive, and media visionary. But above all, you are a storyteller.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Oh, guys, it's so cringey. That is David Zaslav being booed by crowds while speaking at Boston University. And, guys, that's largely how to deal with the ongoing writer's strike. Warner Brothers Discovery along with some of the other major studios like Netflix and Disney currently in those talks.And BU was criticized by their students by announcing that Zaslav would be the guest speaker one day after the strike began. There were people on the picket lines. They had signs. There was chants saying, get off the stage. I mean, this was really intense. And really, it gave me the-- it concerned BU.SEANA SMITH: Yes.ALEXANDRA CANAL: It scared me a little.SEANA SMITH: It was very intense. You mentioned those picketers outside of the commencement ceremony. It was estimated over 300. About 350 people reportedly had been marching earlier that day. You've got to give it to David Zaslav, I think, in this scenario.I could barely watch it. I was so awkward just watching this after this happened. He didn't look too shaken. He looked confident. He continued on with the message, with the speech. He might have altered it just a bit given the fact that his audience was being so aggressive with their boos.I thought he, though, did a very good job at handling this.AKIKO FUJITA: And it wasn't just boos, guys. It was a chance of pay your writers.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Yeah.ALEXANDRA CANAL: So this was a very personal one. But you know what? I mean, to that point, Seana, I think the executives are used to this. But this points to just how intense this discussion has gone because BU is far, far away from Hollywood. But it is about executives, you know, organization, and paying-- or at least meeting their employees where people think they should be met in terms of pays and benefits.ALLIE GARFINKLE: This is the thing for me here. I had one headline thought. And it was, this is an exercise in public humiliation. Was this really necessary? Who let him do this?And I live in LA. I've, sort of, seen how the writers strike has started to affect a lot of people in Los Angeles. And it's the sort of thing where I keep going. Yes, this is super cringey. Yes, has there ever been a good commencement speaker ever? But also, did this have to happen at all?SEANA SMITH: You know, certainly just speaks, like Akiko said, to this issue. And so many people, obviously, very passionate about what happens here.]"

For more stocks, head on over to Billionaire Ken Griffin's 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. The stock market crash of 2022 hammered several major hedge funds. One of the biggest funds that bled capital last year is Chase Coleman and Feroze Dewan's Tiger Global. According to Insider Monkey's research, the hedge fund's portfolio as of the first quarter of 2023 was worth a respectable $10.9 billion. Sounds respectable right? After all, it's more money than most of us will likely ever see in our lifetimes (never say never?). Well, you won't think it's a lot of money when you consider the same hedge fund's portfolio by the end of 2022's first quarter. Back then, the portfolio was worth a whopping $26.6 billion, implying that in just a year, Tiger Global's portfolio has been cut by more than half.Another star that crashed last year was Catherine Wood's Ark Investment. Ark is known for obsessing over high growth technology companies, and these are precisely the ones that didn't see any love from the stock market last year. And the turbulence in these areas has also hammered Ark's portfolio. This portfolio, which was worth $23.9 billion by the end of Q1 2022 is currently worth $14.5 billion. Cumulatively speaking, data from LCH Investments - called the fund of funds - shows that the industry lost $208 billion last year and nearly one tenth of this was simply due to Tiger Global.However, not all funds were losers in 2022. The best performing hedge fund during the year was Ken Griffin's Citadel Investments. Citadel made $16 billion last year, nearly twice what the second best performing hedge fund D.E. Shaw Group made. So, undoubtedly, Citadel is the king of the hedge fund world right now. This strong performance made Citadel's founder and owner Mr. Ken Griffin not only one of the richest hedge fund managers in the world but also one of the richest people on the planet. Data from Forbes Magazine shows that Mr. Griffin's current net worth sits at a cool $32.3 billion - making him one of the fifty richest folks all around. Quite an achievement, we'd say, and one that becomes even more impressive when you consider the history of his fortunes. This is due to the fact that as recently as 2020, the billionaire's net worth stood at $12 billion. Looking at this, it would appear as if while the world is up in flames, Mr. Griffin knows how to hold his ground and do what he's best at doing i.e. making cold, hard cash.Story continuesThe billionaire is an alumnus of Harvard University, and he has been investing since his time at college. He set up Citadel just a year after graduating from university, and would soon go on to make high double digit returns. So naturally, his perspective on how to deal with losses and navigate through adversity is nothing less of a goldmine. Well, lucky for us, Mr. Griffin offered some gems during a fireside chat at the Yale School of Management in April 2023, where he shared:Well there's a little saying, a little quip that I like to make. History is written by the winners. Right. So the wonderful history of Citadel is how we're the most profitable hedge fund of all time. The chapter of how we were on the verge of going business in '08 is now like a footnote in that book. All right. That's a very important note. It is now all been an easy march to success. It's had, you know, I think have the interesting position in life I probably lost, my team has probably lost more money that perhaps any other firm in existence. We just happened to have made more money [LAUGHS] than almost any other firm in existence. And it's the net that everyone talks about. I mean there's years when our lost are. . are. . .hundreds of billions of dollars, I don't know if it's hundreds, it's over a hundred, maybe hundreds. It's numbers are incomprehensible, right. So, number is all my losses are my tuition, I have the most expensive education in American history. And a number of my colleagues have education that are becoming competitively - expensive.And I think it's very important, that like, we, in some sense you have have to have a moment of levity, okay? If every time you lost money, you got depressed and angry and you couldn't deal with it, you'd just have a very short career. you'd just have a very short career. So you need to be able to take a step back and go, 'it's a tuition bill I paid.' And it doesn't mean that you don't think very long and hard about what went wrong. But you have to keep it in perspective.In '08 that tuition bill almost became getting expelled from school. Because we were, we lost half of our equity in sixteen weeks, in a firm that had never had a double digit draw down in twenty years. The only reason we survived, and there's a number of reason, but the principle reason we survived is when long term capital failed 1998, I went and met with a number of senior people that worked at Long Term Capital. Why did I do this? What was my agenda? I wanted to understand how does a firm that loses 90% of its equity in a levered financial services industry, still stay in business? Like if you ask me that's one of the greatest accomplishments of all time, was that they lost 90% of their equity before they lost control of their business in a financial services, in a levered financial services company. And much of what we learned from how they survived that was actually fundamentally existentially important to our ability to withstand the turmoil of 2008. So there's a very important lesson here, which is not only due to want to learn from your mistakes, you would want to learn from other people's mistakes. They're much cheaper tuition bills.Learning from others is central to Mr. Griffin's philosophy. But what if you could learn from him? That's what we will do in this article.

The residential REIT is also growing its presence in Denver, Atlanta and Austin. It is particularly targeting places where affluent renters prefer to live, work and play.The company’s strategic buyouts and encouraging development pipeline bode well for growth. However, the lack of governmental rental assistance in 2023 can impair its revenue growth to some extent. Elevated supply in certain markets and rising interest rates add to its woes.Given the high cost of homeownership, the transition from renter to homeowner is difficult in its markets, making renting apartment units a viable option. For 2023, we estimate total rental income to grow 3.9% year over year.EQR is banking on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation, rent growth and improve the efficiency of its operating platform. It is focused on centralizing certain on-site activities. Per its February Investor Presentation, the company expects to capture an additional $30-$35 million of net operating income (NOI) in the upcoming period.Equity Residential has a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and financial flexibility. Net debt to normalized EBITDAre was 4.17X in the first quarter of 2023. Also, unencumbered NOI, as a percentage of total NOI, was 88.3% as of Mar 31, 2023. Hence, with $2.5 billion in available liquidity as of Mar 31, 2023, limited near-term debt maturities, solid credit metrics and sufficient access to capital markets at favorable rates, the company is well-poised to meet its obligations.Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest attraction for REIT investors and Equity Residential is committed to this purpose. In March 2023, the residential REIT increased its quarterly cash dividend on its common stock to 66.25 cents from 62.50 cents per share paid out earlier, marking a hike of 6% on its annualized dividend. Backed by healthy operating fundamentals, we expect normalized FFO to increase 6% in 2023. Given the company’s solid operating platform, our FFO growth projections and balance sheet strength compared with industry counterparts, this dividend rate is expected to be sustainable.However, Equity Residential faces challenges in attracting renters due to high supply volumes in multiple markets. Construction activity is elevated, resulting in a significant number of upcoming apartment deliveries. Particularly, the Sunbelt markets, including the Denver, Dallas Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta markets, in which the company is expanding, are likely to witness higher supply than its coastal established markets.A hike in interest rate is concerning for Equity Residential. Rising rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. It has a substantial debt burden and its total debt as of Mar 31, 2023, was $7.3 billion. Also, the dividend payout may become less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts.With no governmental rental assistance expected in 2023, revenue growth will depend on the payment behavior of its residents. An expected slowdown in job growth can hurt leasing volume in the upcoming period.Story continuesCurrently, EQR carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Although copper is primarily used in today’s design, the fiber interface is the wave of the future in space applications, as the industry requires data rates exceeding 1 Gigabit.The VSC8574RT PHY is equipped with a quad port to support 10, 100 and 1000BASE-T Ethernet connections for optimal speed and reach, depending on the device requirements. The high-reliability VSC8574RT PHY boasts advanced features, such as Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE) and IEEE® 1588v2 Precision Time Protocol (PTP), for network timing and synchronization in applications requiring highly precise timing.“The VSC8574RT PHY with advanced timing features provides our customers with a connectivity solution for deterministic real-time applications,” said Bob Vampola, vice president of Microchip’s aerospace and defense business unit. “Ethernet solutions are in high demand for space applications, and our COTS-to-RT devices offer increased capabilities with multiport, SGMII and fiber interfaces.”Story continuesThe VSC8574RT specifications include single event latch-up immunity above 78 MeV.cm²/mg and total ionizing dose tested up to 100 krad.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230522005585/en/Figure 1: 2023 Marketing Budget as a Percent of Total Revenue (2019-2023)The annual Gartner 2023 CMO Spend and Strategy Survey was conducted in March and April 2023. Survey respondents were CMOs and marketing leaders in North America and Northern and Western Europe across different industries, company sizes and revenue, with the vast majority of respondents reporting annual revenue of over $1 billion. Gartner experts presented the findings today during the Gartner Marketing Symposium/Xpo, which is taking place here through Wednesday.The survey revealed that marketing budgets compose 9.1% of total company revenue in 2023, remaining relatively flat but still dipping slightly from the 9.5% reported in 2022 (see Figure 1).""Suppressed budgets, increasing costs and lower productivity are squeezing CMOs’ spending power,"" said Ewan McIntyre, Chief of Research and VP Analyst in the Gartner Marketing practice. ""As volatility becomes the new normal, many CMOs are pricing disruption into their 2023 plans.""Seventy-five percent of CMOs are facing increased pressure to ""do more with less"" to deliver profitable growth in 2023. Because of this, 86% of marketers said they must make significant changes to how the marketing function works to achieve sustainable results.""In 2023, CMOs need to become a new type of enterprise leader. This goes beyond serving at the helm of the brand but also assuming a more business-focused role that pivots into a period of investing for profitability versus growth. Those that carry on status-quo will face significant challenges in the near-term,"" said McIntyre.Story continuesMajority of Marketers Under Pressure to Cut Technology SpendCMOs have seen technology investments tumble into new lows of unproductivity, with utilization rates falling from 58% in 2020 to 42% in 2022, according to Gartner research. For this reason, 75% of marketers report being under pressure to cut martech spend this year to deliver better ROI. However, the highest reported investment increase across all major marketing resources by CMOs this year goes toward marketing technology, while the largest decrease to labor.""Like gamblers looking to write-off their losses with the next bet, CMOs are attracted to the allure of newer technologies, no doubt amplified by the chatter around generative AI,"" said McIntyre. ""They are hungry to see its potential to transform marketing campaigns and content creation. While this hunger to invest is understandable, it illustrates the sunk-cost fallacy that more tech is always better.""""The willingness to let the majority of their martech stack sit idle signifies a fundamental resource disconnect for CMOs. It’s difficult to imagine them leaving the same millions of dollars on the table for agencies or in-house resources. This trade-off of technology over people will not help marketing leaders accelerate out of the challenges a recession will bring.""CMOs Expected to Increase Social Advertising Spend and Decrease SearchPaid media leads in budget allocation across major marketing resources (25.6% of overall 2023 budget), followed by marketing technology (25.4%), labor (24.6%) and agencies (23.3%).Social advertising, which currently takes up the most paid media budget, was identified as the top digital channel to receive increased investment this year, followed by digital video advertising and influencer marketing.

To spark productive, lasting changes in organizations and audiences requires catalytic marketing.""Catalytic Marketing is Not About MoreCatalytic experiences help marketers do less to get more: They don’t require additional integrated data, engagement across channels, nor more technology or a fully optimized engine for journey orchestration – all of which caters to CMOs’ budget and resource constraints.Instead, they require one meaningful opportunity that prompts customers to stop and think, change their perspective on something they knew well, or teach them something entirely new about the brand.Gartner research shows that a single catalytic digital experience doubles the likelihood of commercially productive behaviors. It matters even more than having a large number of memorable brand interactions and rating all of them as high-value.Story continuesFor example, one cosmetics company provided customers with an AI-powered assessment of their unique skincare needs, simulating an in-person beauty advisor. Customers could reflect on and explore skin improvement goals based on an honest appraisal of their skin’s features compared to other people their age.""The cosmetic brand went beyond being just another product recommender by supporting customers’ own self-assessment of their skin prior to being routed to any product recommendation,"" said Lizzy Foo Kune, VP Analyst in the Gartner Marketing Practice. ""Ultimately, the catalytic experience it provided deliberately elicited a moment of self-reflection that gave customers the confidence to commit to a new skin care regimen, providing lasting change in their target audience.""The Three C’s of Catalytic CMOs: Clarity, Connections and CourageCatalytic marketing must be supported by a distinct management orientation that allows CMOs to create and deploy these experiences at scale.Catalytic marketing leaders demonstrate and cultivate unusual levels of:Clarity (of strategy) – They willingly articulate a limited set of core objectives and brand traits, and exercise discipline in pursuing a small number of strategically important activities.Connections (of capabilities) – They prioritize capabilities and management techniques that enable coordinated, adaptive use of resources, including converged channel management and cross-channel customer experiences.Courage (of convictions) – They defend choices to constrain remits, push back on urgent but unimportant requests, and opt to pare or devolve ownership of non-core tasks or investments.""Progressive CMOs are breaking free from the cycle of more by embracing catalytic marketing and, in the process, shifting from growing marketing’s scope to growing marketing’s success as an efficient growth engine for the enterprise,"" concluded Guerrero.Additional information will be available in the complimentary Gartner webinar, ""Marketing’s New Directive: Do the Right Amount of Less, and Achieve Profitable Growth.""About the Gartner Marketing Symposium/XpoThe Gartner Marketing Symposium/Xpo is taking place May 22-24, 2023 in Denver, CO, providing marketing leaders with actionable advice about the trends, tools and emerging technologies they need to deliver business results.

He said a wide search was underway to apprehend the attackers, who fled the scene.Blame is likely to fall on the Pakistani Taliban, known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP. The militant group has stepped up attacks in recent months, after unilaterally ending a cease-fire with the Pakistani government in November.A separate militant group, the TTP is allied with the Afghan Taliban and its fighters and leaders often take shelter across the border, in Afghanistan, straining relations between the two countries.]"

36,de44180b-ebbe-3148-b021-a8230d436035,MS,2023-05-23,Morgan Stanley's (MS) James Gorman Announces Retirement in 2023,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanleys-ms-james-gorman-153100802.html,1684769460,STORY,['MS'],"[Morgan Stanley’s MS James Gorman is set to step down as the CEO within the next 12 months.At the annual shareholder meeting on Friday, Gorman said, “The specific timing of the CEO transition has not been determined, but it is the board’s and my expectation that it will occur at some point in the next 12 months.”Gorman replaced John Mack as the CEO of MS in 2010. Since then, he has been the bank’s co-president in charge of global wealth management, investment management and operations. He became chairman in 2012.During his 13-year stay at the bank, Gorman overhauled the bank into a wealth management giant after it almost collapsed during the global financial crisis in 2008.While Gorman did not name his likely successors, he said that the board has “identified three very strong senior internal candidates for consideration as the next CEO.”Gorman informed that he would assume the role of executive chairman for “a period of time” to help Morgan Stanley transition to its next era of leadership.Our TakeUnder Gorman’s leadership, the bank has been focusing more on the Wealth Management (“WM”) and Investment Management (“IM”) segments, as they are less dependent on the volatile nature of the capital markets.The acquisitions of online broker E*Trade Financial for $13 billion in 2010 and the $7-billion purchase of Eaton Vance Corp in 2021 have been steps in this direction. Driven by such efforts, these segments’ aggregate contribution to net revenues jumped to almost 55% in 2022 from 26% in 2010.Also, the WM segment’s total client assets witnessed a three-year (2020-2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.3%, while the IM segment’s total assets under management saw a CAGR of 29.3% over the same period.However, the performance of Morgan Stanley’s Institutional Securities (“IS”) segment, mainly constituting the trading and investment banking (“IB”) businesses, has not been impressive of late. In 2020 and 2021, both businesses witnessed solid growth, aided by the coronavirus outbreak-induced market volatility and higher client activities.However, as markets began to normalize gradually, and several geopolitical and macroeconomic factors weighed on it, the segment’s performance was disappointing in 2022, mainly on subdued IB business. With the current global economic and geopolitical environment continuing to be influenced by elevated inflation, higher rates, worsening macroeconomic outlook and volatility across the global financial markets, the future performance of the segment remains uncertain.Thus, the persistent slowdown in the IB business has led MS to consider cutting around 7% of jobs in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan). This is part of the broader 3,000 IB job cuts the company announced recently.Of the total cuts, China is likely to take the biggest hit, as slowing economic growth in the country is curbing deal-making. Last year, the company had slashed roughly 50 IB jobs in the Asia-Pacific region, with a large number being China-focused positions.Over the past six months, shares of MS have lost 8.5% compared with the industry’s decline of 18.2%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Competitive EnvironmentMorgan Stanley is not the only one that is trimming its workforce. Many other Wall Street firms, including Bank of America BAC and Citigroup C, have been taking similar steps in their IB and wealth management divisions.This March, Citigroup initiated a round of job cuts, slashing hundreds of jobs across the firm, which accounted for less than 1% of its total workforce. Per people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified, the company’s IB division, its operations and technology organization, and the U.S. mortgage-underwriting division were among those affected.In its IB division, Citigroup was struggling because of the industry-wide slowdown in deal-making. In its mortgage division, the company was grappling with reduced mortgage demand because of rising prices and a rapid increase in mortgage rates.Similarly, in February, it was reported that Bank of America was planning to cut jobs in its investment bank. The cuts are expected to have affected less than 200 bankers globally.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $8.17 billion, up 10.24% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.11 per share and revenue of $34.62 billion. These totals would mark changes of +35.69% and +10.43%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Salesforce.com. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.01% lower. Salesforce.com is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Story continuesValuation is also important, so investors should note that Salesforce.com has a Forward P/E ratio of 29.59 right now. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 25.98.Investors should also note that CRM has a PEG ratio of 1.77 right now.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.5 billion, which indicates a decline of 3.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 65 cents per share, which suggests growth of 32.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings has been unchanged in the past 30 days.The apparel and lifestyle products company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.1% in the last reported quarter. Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.6%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRalph Lauren Corporation price-eps-surprise | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteFactors to NoteRalph Lauren has been gaining from brand strength, solid demand, and expansion across all channels and regions. Its strategy of product elevation, acquisition of full-priced consumers, favorable channel and geographic mix, as well as ramping up of its targeting and personalization efforts, is likely to have supported AUR growth in the quarter under review.The company’s focus on expanding digital and omni-channel capabilities via investments in mobile, omni-channel and fulfillment bodes well. Strength across owned and wholesale digital channels globally is likely to have been a key growth driver. Some other notable efforts on the online front are virtual selling appointments, “buy online, pick up in store,” endless aisle product availability, the introduction of additional digital sites in key markets, investments in AI-powered targeting and consumer acquisition.These factors are likely to have aided the top line in the quarter under review. On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected year-over-year revenue growth of mid to high-single digits at constant currency for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The company anticipates an operating margin of 5.5%.However, Ralph Lauren has been reeling under the negative impacts of higher freight and product cost inflation, which are anticipated to have dented margins in the fiscal fourth quarter. These are expected to have more than offset solid AUR growth and a positive product mix in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, unfavorable currency fluctuations are likely to have been concerning. The company expected the unfavorable currency to negatively impact revenues by 500 bps, the gross margin by 140 bps and the operating margin by 160 bps in the to-be-reported quarter. These are likely to have impacted the bottom-line performance in the said quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Ralph Lauren this time around.

While the major indices are up on the year, the current rally has been uneven and largely driven by technology stocks. Many other sectors, from banks to retailers, are lagging behind. Quality companies with strong brands are seeing their share prices languish at or near 52-week lows despite posting robust earnings and providing bullish guidance to Wall Street analysts. While frustrating, the current uneven market offers buying opportunities for investors who know where to look. Long-term investors who pick-up stocks now on the cheap are sure to be rewarded when the market recovers more and we once again enter a broad-based rally that leads to a full-blown bull market. Here are seven high-quality S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy on the dip.TGTTarget$154.18SHOPShopify$60.85GOLDBarrick Gold$17.81ABNBAirbnb$111.87COINCoinbase$60.26FFord Motor$11.64RLRalph Lauren$112.78S&amp;P 500 Stocks: Target (TGT)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockDiscount retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) just announced its latest earnings, and things are looking up. The company managed to beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom lines despite seeing declining consumer spending in the first quarter of this year. Earnings per share came in at $2.05, which was well ahead of analysts expectations for $1.76. Revenue in the quarter rose 1% from $25.17 billion, slightly above analysts’ forecasts.Target maintained its previous full-year guidance, saying it expects comparable sales will range from a low single-digit decline to a low single-digit increase this year. While the company acknowledged it is seeing consumers buy fewer discretionary items, it is still managing to draw people to its stores with groceries. Target also reported that its inventory level declined 16% year-over-year at the end of the quarter, driven by a 25% reduction in discretionary merchandise. TGT stock rose on the earnings beat but remains down 25% from a year ago.Story continuesInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsS&amp;P 500 Stocks: Shopify (SHOP)Man holding stacks of money. millionaire stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockFor a technology stock that is on a comeback, look to e-commerce company Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). To date, Shopify has gained 70%, making it a top performer on the year. SHOP also still remains nearly 10% below its 52-week high and is trading 65% below its all-time high reached in Nov. 2021 during the peak of the Covid-19 trade.The company’s share price recently jumped 23% in a single trading session after it announced better-than-expected earnings and said that it is cutting 20% of its workforce. Shopify’s revenue in Q1 of this year rose 25% year-over-year to $1.51 billion. The company also announced EPS of 5 cents when analysts who cover the company were forecasting a loss of 4 cents. The new layoffs announced at the same time as the earnings mark the second round of job cuts at Shopify. Last summer, the company cut 10% of its workforce. Shopify said it is making the cuts so that it can focus on its core business of creating tools for companies to sell products online.S&amp;P 500 Stocks: Barrick Gold (GOLD)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comThe price of gold is hovering near $2,000 an ounce and has been nearing all-time highs this year. With economic uncertainty and fears of a recession growing, investors have been piling into gold, making now a good time to buy a stock like Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD). Even better, investors can buy GOLD, which is currently on sale after dipping on missed earnings expectations.While Barrick Gold announced that its profit in Q1 came in 73% lower than a year earlier at $120 million, the poor showing was due to the miner running into issues with its overseas operations. As a result, revenue in Q1 slipped 7% to $2.64 billion. However, Barrick Gold is benefitting from the rising price of the gold that it mines. The company’s average realized gold price during Q1 rose to $1,902 per ounce, up from $1,876 in the previous year. Should the price of gold trend upwards, GOLD stock could rebound strongly.S&amp;P 500 Stocks: Airbnb (ABNB)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7We can also look to home-sharing and rental company Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). The stock plunged 14% on May 9 after the company issued weaker-than-expected forward guidance. Unfortunately, that weak guidance overshadowed the fact that Airbnb delivered Q1 results that beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines, with EPS of 18 cents, double the expected EPS of just nine cents.Even better, the latest results swung Airbnb to a net profit of $117 million from a net loss of $19 million a year earlier. However, investors seemed to panic when Airbnb warned that second-quarter comparisons would be difficult and lowered its revenue projections. The company added that its average daily rates were flat in Q1 compared to a year ago at $168. This news sent ABNB stock into a tailspin. As a result, the share price is now 7% below where it was trading at 12 months ago. Investors should view it as a buying opportunity.Coinbase (COIN)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comFor another beaten down stock that is on the mend, there is Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN). The cryptocurrency exchange was pummeled last year by the twin forces of the “tech wreck” and “crypto winter.” However, COIN stock has staged an impressive rally ytd, rising 80% since January. But even with that massive gain, the stock is still sitting 14% lower than where it was 12 months ago, is 48% below its 52-week high, and is down 83% for its all-time high. There’s still time to buy the dip in this leading crypto name.COIN stock got a 9% boost in early May after the company reported that its Q1 revenue rose 23% from a year ago to $773 million. Coinbase also reported an adjusted loss of 34 cents per share, which was much better than the loss of $1.45 a share that analysts had anticipated. Trading volume on the crypto exchange totaled $145 billion during Q1 as the crypto winter thawed. Coinbase said it continues to focus on international expansion, having recently started new operations in Canada, Bermuda, Brazil and Singapore.Ford Motor (F)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comFord Motor (NYSE:F) also appears to have turned a page this year. The Detroit automaker recently reported a Q1 profit of $1.8 billion as sales of its vehicles increased following supply chain issues experienced last year. The profit in Q1 of this year compares to a net loss of $3.1 billion in the year earlier quarter. Revenue during Q1 totaled $39.09 billion compared to $36.08 billion that was called for on Wall Street. Looking ahead, Ford maintained its previous guidance, saying it expects between $9 billion and $11 billion in earnings this year.While strong, the Q1 print has done little to help F stock. This year, the company’s share price is down 1%. In the last 12 months, the stock has slumped 15%. This presents a great buy-the-dip opportunity. Investors who take a position in F stock now are likely to benefit as the company executes on its electric vehicle strategy, which aims have 40% of its global sales be electric vehicles by 2030. To that end, the company is spending more than $30 billion on electric vehicle development, including batteries, by decade’s end.Ralph Lauren (RL)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comClothing retailer Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) is in the early stages of recovery. RL stock is up 2% on the year but down 3% over the last five years. The shares are trading 13% below their 52-week high. Higher interest rates and slowing consumer spending on clothing and other discretionary items has hurt sentiment related to the company and its stock. However, Ralph Lauren has demonstrated its resiliency, posting better-than-expected earnings that have made many investors give the stock a second look.EPS in its most recent quarter came in at $3.35, beating the consensus forecast of $2.91. Ralph Lauren has beat analyst estimates in four consecutive quarters now. The outperformance has led to numerous upgrades of RL stock. The company also continues to buy back its own stock, taking its share count down to 69 million from 75 million last year. Plus, Ralph Lauren pays a decent quarterly dividend that yields 2.68%, which equates to a payment of 75 cents a share.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

The world needs a ton of electricity and transportation fuels every day. Energy is inflation-protected, as prices tend to rise during unsettled periods such as we’ve experienced recently. And energy stocks sell at low P/E ratios while often offering high dividend yields.But investors shouldn’t lose sight of the energy industry’s environmental and regulatory risks. Over time, the world is moving toward green energy solutions and a net zero future. Environmentalists and politicians will continue to make additional efforts to curtail traditional energy companies. And these three energy stocks, in particular, face elevated regulatory and political risk levels in the coming months and years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPG&amp;E Energy (PCG)the PG&amp;E logo on the front of a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comCalifornia power utility PG&amp;E Energy (NYSE:PCG) has enjoyed a remarkable run. PCG stock is up 44% over the past year, a massive move in a traditionally sleepy sector such as power utilities.While investors may turn to defensive stocks such as PG&amp;E Energy, investors may be underestimating the risk.For one thing, this is the same PG&amp;E that went bankrupt a few years ago in the fallout of the massive California wildfires in the late 2010s.PG&amp;E was liable for not taking sufficient measures to prevent possible fires resulting from downed power lines.California remains a difficult regulatory environment for energy companies. PG&amp;E is also facing a lawsuit from environmental groups seeking to close the company’s Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant.Peabody Energy (BTU)Peabody Energy (BTU) coal mining company logo seen displayed on smart phoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comPeabody Energy (NYSE:BTU) is one of the world’s largest coal companies, selling 124 million tons of coal in 2022 while serving 26 countries.In 2022, coal enjoyed something of a revival. The invasion of Ukraine took a ton of oil and natural gas off the market. In particular, European countries had to import large amounts of natural gas from overseas, which caused prices to surge globally. As natural gas and coal are interchangeable for many purposes, the skyrocketing price of natural gas gave coal a major boost.Story continuesBTU stock soared, rising from $10 at the start of 2022 to as high as $32 recently. But, investors shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that coal is the dirtiest of the fossil fuels. It has a role during global emergencies, such as last year. However, ultimately, coal is set to be phased out the most quickly of our energy sources, putting companies like Peabody in a difficult position.While the coal sector fared well, 2023 will be much more difficult. Natural gas prices have slumped, which should also end the rebound in coal. That makes Peabody and other coal names energy stocks sell today.Gran Tierra Energy (GTE)Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) logo displayed on baby blue oil barrel next to red valve with steel pipes in backgroundSource: shutterstock.com/Maxx-StudioGran Tierra Energy (NYSEMKT:GTE) is an oil exploration company primarily in Colombia. GTE stock has appealed to many bargain hunters due to its exceptionally low P/E and price-to-free cash flow ratios.However, the issue is its geography. In 2022, after decades of continuous moderate or right-wing leadership, Colombia voted for a left-wing president, Gustavo Petro. He campaigned on moving the economy toward sustainable income sources such as tourism and agriculture while ending any new oil exploration in Colombia.Since the election, he has continued that anti-oil stance. Despite that, the oil companies were holding on, as Colombia has been honoring existing production contracts. In recent weeks, however, the political climate has worsened significantly. Petro reshuffled much of his cabinet, moving far toward the left and setting off alarms about the stability of the government.Meanwhile, even state-run oil company Ecopetrol (NYSE:EC) warned that it is struggling to increase production in the current climate. I’ve been notably bullish on EC stock in the past, but I’ve tempered my enthusiasm there, given the recent political developments.More broadly, if the state-backed oil operator is having issues, it speaks badly for independent operators without government backing. GTE stock may have better days, but for now, the Colombian political situation is too unsettled to make Gran Tierra worth owning.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in EC stock.

Apple is the fourth-best performing component of the closely tracked FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) complex, lagging the 105% gain in Meta (META), 41% increase in Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and 39% appreciation in Amazon (AMZN).In the process of its push higher, Apple has added about $690 billion in market cap. The company's stock market valuation now stands at $2.74 trillion, according to Yahoo Finance data, only 9% away from the $3 trillion mark.Apple is the highest-valued company in the stock market, with Microsoft (MSFT) a close second, sporting a $2.38 trillion market cap.Pros point to several reasons behind the impressive run in Apple's stock.First, Apple continues to have a great story to tell investors on multiple fronts.""For Apple there is massive installed base momentum going to the iPhone 15 anniversary cycle, and it has put a tailwind in the stock coupled by demand being solid in the field,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives tells Yahoo Finance.That two could become a three soon. (Photo by Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images) (Gareth Cattermole via Getty Images)That installed base momentum could be stoked further at the company's 2023 Worldwide Developers Conference, which kicks off June 5.Apple is widely anticipated to introduce the iOS 17 operating system. But some Apple watchers are holding out hope the company finally unveils its new AR/VR headset that has been in the works for years.Meantime, Apple's latest quarterly results — while not perfect — have been viewed favorably by investors looking for relative safety amid the debt ceiling drama and sticky inflation.""Overall, the results [from Apple] and guidance are exactly what investors were looking for from the company to feel reassured of its defensive positioning and at the same time the greater resilience of Big Tech in general in the current macro as well as on potential further macro deterioration, making it palpable to still keep paying 26x near-term earnings for Apple shares,"" said JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a client note.Story continuesChatterjee added: ""While we can see some investors squirm about a 26x earnings multiple, we believe the resilience of the business proving out in the numbers currently as well as the early part of the pandemic (2020) will amply justify the reasons to pay a premium.""FILE - In this May 7, 2018, photo, Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett smiles during an interview in Omaha, Neb. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Another vote of confidence from a special investor has helped sentiment on Apple, too.Billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said earlier this month he purchased more shares of Apple. Berkshire now owns a $151 billion stake in Apple, up from $1 billion in May 2016.Berkshire is Apple's third-largest institutional shareholder, behind BlackRock (second) and Vanguard (one), according to Yahoo Finance data.""Apple is different than the other businesses we own. It just happens to be a better business,"" Buffett said at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting earlier in May.As for what could trip up Apple's stock, pros find it hard to come up with a major selling event. Many highlight China's economic recovery stalling as a key risk to Apple's stock price in 2023, however.Said Ives: ""Outside of the usual black swan events, the biggest risk to Apple’s stock is around the demand environment in China taking a step down. China is the hearts and lungs of the Apple growth story and so far so good, but that is the biggest risk for the stock.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

For more stocks, head on over to Bill Gates' Most Recent Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Today's age is the information age. If you have a smartphone and an internet connection, you can look up vast amounts of information sufficient to form an informed opinion on a variety of topics. One such topic is global wealth, and one of the most well known billionaires ever since the growth of the internet is Bill Gates.Mr. Gates, responsible for setting up one of the world's largest technology companies, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), has dominated the global rich list for several years. Bill Gates was the first person in human history to cross $100 billion in total worth, during the peak of the dotcom era as Microsoft's shares boomed during the peak of the bubble. Mr. Gates first made it on Forbes' billionaire list in 1987 and became the world's richest person in 1995. This kicked off a period of dominance by Mr. Gates, as he maintained that spot until 2008 when he lost the title to the Mexican business tycoon Carlos Slim. This would be a short lived victory for Mr. Slim, as the Microsoft billionaire would retake the top spot a year later and maintain the position until 2010 to lose the title once again for three years and regain it in 2017. Gates only lost the richest person title after he donated $55 billion of his wealth to the Gates Foundation. Safe to say, for Mr. Gates, being the world's richest person is as normal as filing taxes for the rest of us.These days, Bill Gates is the sixth richest person in the world, and by our estimates, he really couldn't care less. His net worth, according to Forbes Magazine, is $114 billion, and according to the magazine's estimates, $30 billion of this fortune is held in cash. Quite a sizeable bank balance, we'd say. While the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is one of the best known investment vehicles for Mr. Gates, the billionaire also runs his family office called Cascade Investment. Cascade is also managed by the Gates Foundation's manager Michael Larson. Mr. Gates is the only owner of Cascade, and the firm's SEC filings reveal investments in a variety of firms such as AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO), Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL), Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI), and Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE).Story continuesThe foundation of Bill Gates' wealth is built on software. His firm Microsoft is the largest company in the world in terms of market share of the personal computing operating systems market. He has seen the computing industry since its inception, and naturally, this provides him with a unique perspective and insight into the industry. Given the current hype surrounding artificial intelligence, it's relevant to see his take on the matter. Fortunately for us, Mr. Gates shared his thoughts on the matter in March 2023 Microsoft podcast where he outlined:A.I. has always been the holy grail of computer science. And, when I was young, Stanford Research had Shaky the Robot that was trying to pick things up. There were various logic systems that people were working on. You know so the dream was always some sort of reasoning capability. Overall progress in A.I., until machine learning came along, So was pretty modest. Even speech recognition was just barely reasonable. So we had that gigantic acceleration with machine learning particularly in sort of sensory things, recognizing speech, recognizing pictures. And it was phenomenal. And it just, you know kept getting better and scale was part of that. But we were still missing anything that had to do with complex logic. With being able to say read a text, and do what a human does, which is quote and understand what's in that text. And so as Microsoft was doing more with Open AI, I had a chance to go see them myself independently a number of times. They were doing a lot of text generation, they had a robot arm. The early text generation still didn't seem to have a broad understanding, you know like it could generate a sentence saying Joe's in Chicago, and then two sentences later say Joe's in Seattle which its local probabilistic sense was a good sentence but a human has a broad understanding of the world from both experience and reading. That you understand, that can't be. So they were enthusing about GPT-3 and even the early versions of GPT-4, I said to them, 'hey, if you can pass an advanced placement biology exam, where you take a question that's not part of the training set, or a bunch of them, and give fully reasoned answers knowing that biology textbook is one of many things that's in that training corps, then you will really get my attention because that would be a heck of a milestone. So, you know, please work on that.' I thought you know that would, they'd go away for two or three years. Because my intuition has always been we needed to understand knowledge representation and symbolic reasoning in a more explicit way. So that we were one or two inventions short of something where it was very good at reading and writing. And therefore being an assistant and so it was amazing that [they] over the summer were saying, yeah it might not be that long before we're going to come demo this thing to you because it's actually doing pretty well on scientific learning.So, with these details in mind, let's take a look at Bill Gates' top stock picks for 2023 out of which the biggest stakes are in Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI), Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

It also accuses the company of terminating two employees because of their involvement in the Amazon Labor Union. Amazon should be forced, among other measures, to rescind its off-duty access policy for at least three years, the complaint says.The complaint also accuses Jassy of violating federal labor law by saying, during a live interview as part of the New York Times Dealbook summit, that union representation would make workers less empowered and would make it harder for them to have direct relationships with managers. Jassy made the comments in November, a month after the NLRB issued a prior complaint saying similar comments the CEO had made to CNBC and to Bloomberg News also violated the law.Federal labor law allows companies to vocally oppose unionization, but restricts them from threatening or retaliating against workers for organizing, and requires them to negotiate over working conditions if employees do vote to unionize.Story continuesAmazon has repeatedly denied violating the law. “These complaints are completely without merit and we look forward to showing that through the legal process,” company spokesperson Eileen Hards said Tuesday in an email. While the NLRB has certified ALU as the representative of the Staten Island workers, the Seattle-based company has argued that the union’s landmark election victory last year should be overturned due to misconduct, an argument it has signaled it will pursue in federal court.In November, a federal judge in New York ordered Amazon to cease and desist from retaliating against employees for workplace activism.Complaints issued by NLRB prosecutors are heard by agency judges, whose rulings can be appealed to the labor board members in Washington, and then to federal court. The agency has the authority to order employers to reinstate workers and change policies, but not to fine them punitive damages or hold executives personally liable for violations.Read more: Amazon Workers Launch Battle to Unionize in BritainThe NLRB’s Monday complaint alleged that Jassy’s comments were “interfering with, restraining and coercing employees” in their ability to exercise their rights. ALU argued that the comments constituted a threat to cut off workers’ access to supervisors if they unionized.Complaints issued by NLRB officials personally naming prominent executives are relatively unusual. Under the agency’s current general counsel, President Joe Biden appointee Jennifer Abruzzo, the agency is also prosecuting a case accusing Starbucks Corp.’s former CEO Howard Schultz of making an anti-union threat during a meeting last year. A pro-union worker said Schultz asked them at the meeting, “If you hate Starbucks so much, why don’t you work somewhere else?” Starbucks has denied wrongdoing.“All these Succession-style billionaires should be held accountable for unlawful actions, and that’s what we’re doing,” ALU attorney Seth Goldstein said Monday. The complaint, he said, “is going to send a strong message to the union-busters and to CEOs like Jassy who think that they can say whatever they want to and they won’t be held accountable.”(Updates with Amazon comment in sixth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekSergey Brin Has a Secret Plan to Put Airships Back in the SkiesAdidas After YeezyThere’s Still Scary Stuff in SunscreenYou’re the CEO and Your Company Got Hacked—What Now?Jazz Struggles on Streaming, But Vinyl Sales Give the Genre Hope©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Also, its focus on product innovation boosts growth.Recently, Starbucks reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.6% and 3.9%, respectively. Also, the bottom and the top lines grew 25.4% and 14.2% year over year, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 sales and EPS indicates growth of 11.9% and 16.2%, respectively, from the previous year’s reported levels.Shares of SBUX have rallied 43.7% in the past year against the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry’s growth of 32.1%. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 have moved north to $3.44 per share from $3.42 per share over the past 30 days. This depicts analysts' optimism over the company’s growth prospects.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, persisting inflationary pressure, increased expenses and consumer spending risks are major concerns.What is Favoring SBUX?Starbucks witnessed solid comps growth in all its operational segments in second-quarter fiscal 2023, attributable to increase in comparable transactions and average ticket. In the reported quarter, North America comps grew 12% courtesy of a 6% increase in comparable transactions and a 5% increase in average ticket. International comps also grew 7%, driven by a 7% increase in comparable transactions. Global comps increased 11%, mainly because of a 6% increase in comparable transactions and a 4% increase in average ticket.Starbucks also focuses on increasing global market share by judiciously opening stores in new and existing markets, remodeling existing stores, deploying technology, controlling costs and aggressive product innovation and brand building. In second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company opened 464 net new stores globally, reflecting a total store count of 36,634. For 2023, the company expects global store growth to be nearly 7%, with anticipated store count in the United States and China likely to grow approximately 3% and 13%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.After the business downturn due to COVID-19, China bounced back faster than expected and has been contributing majorly to consolidated revenues of SBUX for the past three quarters. In second-quarter fiscal 2023, revenues in China increased 3% to $763.8 million year over year with 3% comps growth. In the quarter, the company opened 153 net new stores across China and it anticipates nearly 13% store growth in 2023. The company ended second-quarter fiscal 2023 with approximately 6,200 Starbucks stores across 244 cities in China and is on track to have 9,000 stores by 2025.Starbucks is strengthening its product portfolio with significant innovation around beverages, refreshment, health and wellness, tea and core food offerings. In February 2023, the company launched the Starbucks Oleato range of beverages, available in 650 stores across Italy, Japan and the United States, receiving positive feedback upon launching.Story continuesHeadwindsStarbucks is facing restrictions in its potential growth due to persisting inflationary pressure. Our model predicts total operating expense to increase 10.3% year over year on higher store operating and other operating expenses.Also, being a retail restaurant, Starbucks is dependent on the consumer discretionary spending environment. Consumers’ propensity to spend largely depends upon the overall macroeconomic scenario.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksStarbucks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This was despite a slight miss on the top line, with sales of $666.10 million coming up -2% short of estimates.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStill, Viasat’s usage in the recent Kennedy Space Center launch on April 30th featuring SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy shuttle has many investors intrigued. This is expecially true with Tesla (TSLA) boss Elon Musk running the helm of SpaceX as well. Viasat stated the launch represented a new era as a global communication services company.Viasat’s earnings estimate revisions have jumped much higher since the company’s Q4 report. Earnings are now forecasted to jump from -$2.87 per share in fiscal 2023 to -$1.41 a share in Viasat’s current FY24. Even better, FY25 earnings are expected to soar into the black at $0.87 per share. On the top line, sales are forecasted to rise 4% in FY24 and jump another 14% in FY25 to $3.16 billion.Viasat’s earnings potential is starting to become attractive with the company's ViaSat-3 EMEA satellite on pace to launch again this year.

62,e71244a9-e7f8-3c5f-99c7-a6b03ab26973,SNPS,2023-05-23,Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Synopsys Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-synopsys-123004955.html,1684758604,STORY,['SNPS'],"[For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Synopsys (SNPS) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to SNPS for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Synopsys' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Synopsys' main business drivers.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. The company offers a full suite of products used in the logic synthesis and functional verification phases of chip design, including a broad array of reusable design building blocks. It also sells physical synthesis and physical design products as well as physical verification products.The company’s products are used to design a chip, from concept to the point of delivery to the manufacturer for fabrication. Synopsis provides software and hardware, which are used to develop electronic systems that incorporate chips. Additionally, the company provides Intellectual Property (IP) used in semiconductor design and manufacturing to simplify the design process and accelerate time-to-market for its customers.Synopsis reports revenues in three segments, namely Time-Based Products, Upfront Products and Maintenance and Service.Time-Based Products (59% of fiscal 2022 revenues): Segment revenues are recognized as Technology Subscription License (TSL) revenues. Under this segment, the company recognizes revenues from fees over the period of the license or as and when the installments are paid by the customer, whichever is later.Upfront Products (24%): These revenues are recognized as Term License revenues. Under this segment, the company recognizes revenues from term licenses in full after the completion of the shipment of the software, wherein at least 75% of the license fee is paid within a year of shipment, after fulfilling all other revenue recognition criteria.Maintenance and Service (17%): Under this segment revenues come from maintenance fees that are generated over the maintenance period; along with revenues generated from professional service and training fees.The company conducts its business across four geographic regions namely: North America (47% of fiscal 2022 revenues), China (16%), Europe (10%), Korea (10%) and others (17%).Synopsys’ competitors include EDA vendors like Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corporation.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Synopsys ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2013 would be worth $11,394.70, or a 1,039.47% gain, as of May 22, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 151.40% and gold's return of 39.18% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for SNPS.Synopsys is benefiting from strong design wins owing to a robust product portfolio. Growth in hybrid working trend is driving demand for bandwidth. Strong traction for Synopsys’ Fusion Compiler product boosted the top line. Growing demand for advanced technology, design, IP and security solutions is also creating solid prospects. Rising impact of artificial intelligence, 5G, internet of things and big data is driving investments in new compute and machine learning architectures. Shares of the company have outperformed the industry over the past year. However, tightening corporate budget amid ongoing macroeconomic challenges and unfavorable currency exchange rates might hurt the company’s near-term growth prospect. Geopolitical challenges and restrictions over trade with Huawei are other woes.Shares have gained 8.28% over the past four weeks and there have been 1 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

63,9ec39e01-9b28-3a33-a841-c1f61629436f,PM,2023-05-23,"""Cigarettes belong in museums,"" says Philip Morris International CEO in speech in London",Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigarettes-belong-museums-says-philip-081000751.html,1684829400,STORY,['PM'],"[CEO says science-backed alternatives have the potential to accelerate the decline in cigarette smoking and cautioned that historical tobacco control measures alone are not working fast enoughCalls on governments to follow the smoking reduction policies of nations like Sweden, Japan, and the U.K. and reduce smoking faster by giving adult smokers a wide choice of smoke-free alternativesLONDON, May 23, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer of Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM), today delivered remarks at the UnHerd Club in London, calling on governments globally to accelerate the end of cigarettes.In his remarks to global media, politicians, and policymakers, Olczak shared that ""cigarettes belong in museums"" but that current policies to reduce smoking prevalence are not working fast enough and may be prolonging smoking.Drawing upon a new hypothetical model based on World Health Organization data, estimates, and methods, as well as other third party data, Olczak explained that even if smoke-free products were assumed to be only 80 percent less risky than cigarettes, if people who currently smoke were to switch to them completely, then over their lifetime there’s a potential for a tenfold reduction in smoking-attributable deaths compared with historical tobacco control measures alone. He highlighted the absurd paradox that smoke-free products are banned in some countries while cigarettes—despite their far greater risk of harm—can still be sold. While this model has limitations and is built on assumptions, the public health cost of ignoring the potential of smoke-free products could be immense.In 2016, PMI committed to moving away from cigarettes. The company has invested more than USD 10.5 billion (as of March 31, 2023) since 2008 in developing and commercializing smoke-free products—which today account for nearly 35 percent of the company’s total net revenues. The mission, Olczak explained, is to reduce smoking by replacing cigarettes with less harmful alternatives and ultimately to make cigarettes obsolete. However, PMI’s ability to progress on this mission is being frustrated by a combination of blind opposition from anti-tobacco organizations and governments’ overreliance on the so-called precautionary principle, which some interpret as ""better not to do anything until we know everything.""Story continuesHe called on governments around the world to follow the examples of countries like Sweden and Japan—as well as the U.K.—and adopt policies that give adult smokers who don’t quit a wide choice of alternatives to continuing smoking so they can make better choices and cigarettes can become a historical artifact. He also challenged anti-tobacco organizations to update their thinking, stop blocking innovation, and work toward a common goal to achieve a smoke-free future, faster.The full speech is available below:""We’ve all heard the line, ‘Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.’And still, despite often restrictive regulations, high product prices, marketing bans, and packaging designed to discourage buying, today public health data show that a billion people worldwide choose to smoke.Not to mention public health campaigns—and even companies like mine—urging people not to smoke.The persistence of high smoking rates globally is evidence that the current approach to ending cigarette use is not working quickly enough.And yet the most common response to the problem is more of the same.It’s time to try something else. To try a more inclusive and innovative approach; one that has been proven in several countries around the world and that has the potential to significantly accelerate an end to cigarettes.For adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, switching to a smoke-free product is a pragmatic option that can have a positive impact on both individual and public health.Let there be no mistake: People who have never used tobacco or nicotine, especially minors, should not use these products. And there’s no doubt that quitting altogether, or better still, never starting, is the best choice.But, let’s focus for now on adult smokers who have not quit. Today, thanks to smoke-free products, these one billion people have better options than continuing to smoke. And because of these options, we can begin to imagine an accelerated decline in smoking and associated diseases … and not by a little, by a lot.Here’s the curious thing: I’m moving Philip Morris International out of cigarettes, but the faster I go, the more people shout at me.Our mission is clear: to reduce smoking by replacing cigarettes with less harmful alternatives.Cigarettes belong in museums.Since 2016, my company has fully committed to moving away from cigarettes, the most harmful form of nicotine consumption. We have invested more than 10.5 billion U.S. dollars in developing and commercializing smoke-free products—which today account for nearly 35 percent of our total net revenues.Our ability to make further progress is being blocked by those who are blindly guided by a desire to see an end to the industry rather than an end to cigarettes. This is very frustrating.This, together with an overreliance on the so-called precautionary principle—which some interpret as ""better not to do anything until we know everything""—results in government inaction and more of the same.Today’s environment and rhetoric make it easier for governments and regulators to do nothing on smoke-free alternatives. It’s perceived as safer for political careers to abstain from the debate completely rather than be seen as siding with us.But, in the end, this is just prolonging the life of cigarettes and risks shortening the lives of those who use them.For smokers today, inaction is not a neutral position. It is a choice with real-world outcomes.We are entering what Churchill called ""a period of consequences.""It is no longer a case of if these smoke-free alternatives are better than cigarette smoking; it is a case of by how much.Using the World Health Organization’s data, estimates, and methods, we’ve calculated the potential positive public health impact of the world’s smokers switching from cigarettes to less harmful, smoke-free products.This hypothetical model shows that if these products are assumed to be 80 percent less risky than cigarettes—and if people who currently smoke were to switch to them completely—then over their lifetime, there’s a potential for a tenfold reduction in smoking-attributable deaths compared with historical tobacco control measures alone.Let me repeat that hypothesis: Based on the W-H-O’s own data, we see the real potential for a tenfold reduction in smoking-attributable deaths if smokers fully switched to smoke-free products. And this positive impact could be even greater when combined with traditional measures to discourage initiation and encourage cessation.While there are limitations to this kind of hypothetical analysis, this estimate begins to show the real impact of inaction. The human impact.But this is not just a hypothetical situation.Look at public health data in Sweden, a country that today boasts one of the developed world’s lowest smoking rates, at around 5 percent.There, snus—a non-combustible form of moist tobacco that is placed between the lip and gums—is the most commonly used alternative to cigarettes.According to this data, mortality rates due to tobacco use in Sweden are much, much lower than in EU countries where snus are banned.The Swedish Snus Commission estimates that more than 350,000 smoking-attributable deaths among men could have been avoided each year if the other EU countries had matched Sweden’s tobacco-related mortality rate.We can also look at Japan, which has seen rapidly declining smoking rates since the introduction of heated tobacco products in 2014. Just like in Sweden, these non-combustible products are beginning to replace cigarettes.Five years after the products were introduced, the Japanese National Health and Nutrition Survey showed an unprecedented decline in the number of adults who smoke cigarettes. More recent studies show that the pace of decline has continued, and today only about 12 percent of Japanese adults smoke. And while more research is needed, we are beginning to see the emergence of encouraging data hinting at a positive impact on public health already.Contrast this with Japan’s neighbor Singapore, where smoke-free products are banned. In that country, cigarette sales volume has actually increased, and smoking rates are not going down.Despite all this evidence, the policy of inaction continues in many places—preventing less harmful products from replacing the cigarette.When governments—and organizations that lobby them—prevent men and women who continue to smoke from accessing less harmful alternatives, and when they perpetuate misinformation about these products, it has a direct correlation to the persistence of smoking.My question is: Will governments that ban these products or treat them like cigarettes take responsibility for the consequences?Will society stand up and call out the organizations that are blocking progress?Or will this insanity persist—leaving us with more of the same and millions of people needlessly continuing to smoke?It is time for more countries to follow the lead of Sweden, Japan, and other countries such as the U.K.It’s time for anti-tobacco organizations to stop fighting against us and start fighting for adults who smoke. Just imagine the impact of a potential tenfold further reduction if all current adult smokers were to fully switch for the remainder of their lives to smoke-free products, compared with historical measures alone.It’s time to work toward a common goal of delivering effective policies that make cigarettes a historical artifact, a museum piece collecting dust behind glass cases.We need to remember that there is a real, human impact of inaction. Because not taking an evidenced-based decision on smoke-free products today is a decision with consequences.""ENDSPhilip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free FuturePhilip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs). As of March 31, 2023, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 78 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 18.5 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 35% of PMI’s total 2023 first-quarter net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin Pharma business, aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation, Cisco, Inc. and Philip Morris International Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;NVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+89.9% vs. +42.4%). The company is gaining from strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute &amp; Networking revenues. The stock was up big following the last quarterly release on February 22nd and Nvidia fans will be hoping for a repeat perforance it comes out with quarterly numbers this coming Wednesday (May 24th).A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.However, NVDA’s near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and data center chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Cisco have modestly outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past year (+16.1% vs. +15.5%). The company’s end-to-end security is benefiting from strong demand for Cisco’s unified threat management and zero trust offerings.Cisco witnessed strong demand for its products, including the Catalyst 9000 family, Meraki, and Nexus 9000 offerings. Expanding growth opportunities for low-power-consuming technologies, including IoT, Silicon One and Power over Ethernet bodes well for Cisco. Its investments across security business, focusing on cloud-based offerings, is expected to drive growth in the long haul.Cisco now expects modest revenue growth in fourth quarter. Earnings is expected to grow at a higher rate than revenues driven by gross margin expansion and disciplined expense management.(You can read the full research report on Cisco here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Philip Morris have declined -1.9% over the past six months against the Zacks Tobacco industry’s decline of -4.5%. The company has been battling cost-related headwinds and expects certain margin pressures in the first half of 2023. Also, soft cigarette shipment volumes and volatile currency movements have been concerns. In 2023, the total international industry volume is estimated to decline by 1-2%, excluding China and United States.Nevertheless, Philip Morris has been gaining from its pricing power. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance in the first quarter of 2023 and is likely to drive performance in the full year.A focus on reduced risk products, especially IQOS, has been working well for the company, which is witnessing a continued product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products. These upsides are likely to boost organic revenues in 2023.(You can read the full research report on Philip Morris here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include BCE Inc. and Ameriprise Financial, Inc.Story continuesWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Now.The basic materials industry is huge and includes major segments like oil, metals &amp; mining, chemicals, and other raw materials. The industry often remains in flux amid changing oil and commodity prices. Oil companies account for a major chunk of the basic materials industry. Major oil stocks like ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum are trading in the red this year amid fears of a slowing economy and recession. This lackluster performance of oil companies comes after a huge outperformance of the energy sector last year.Pessimism Around ChinaThe biggest factor that is denting the performance of many energy and commodities companies this year is the pessimism surrounding Chinese economic growth. Earlier this year the market cheered the reopening of China. The world was expecting the demand for commodities to surge as Chinese factories and industries fire up. But the economic growth in China remains slower than expected.For April, China’s indicator of manufacturing activity declined to 49.2 from the previous month’s 51.9 reading. On April 25, copper prices fell to their five-week lows after data indicated a slower-than-expected rebound in activity in China and rising inventors at the London Metal Exchange warehouse system.Talking about the reopening dynamics in China and how it’s affecting iron ore, steel prices and related business of the company, Vale’s management said the following in its latest earnings call:""So we’ve been seeing the recovery in China. Definitely we have strong numbers. You mentioned that GDP FAI very resilient, infrastructure investment properties, we have good news also. So the bright side that we are in the stocking mall in China. So, we see the sales increasing also the accomplishment of construction also increase. You mentioned all the micro numbers, blast furnace going well, we just came from China. It’s a common sense that production will be flat this year. So the production is there. So what is concerning today, so, the first thing is related to property. It is a cycle. So we firstly we need to sell, finish the construction. So land sales and new starts are coming.So that didn’t come yet. So that’s the main volatility that we see in our — even in our clients. They are in a wait and see mode. But everybody’s waiting that for only for the second half. So we are on track and we need to wait for that. I think price in steel, it’s another concern. But the good news is, if you see the export that you had in China, this quarter. That implies that we have a symmetry in the price, ex-China comparing to China. So there is a wind that can help China to improve the price in the steel market. And as a combination of all of this, we have a tepid or really tepid margins steel mill. So with all this, we have this wait and see behavior, we have old inventors are really low. So in our perspective in short-term, we can see a rebound, we have this next holiday that is coming out and they will need to replenish the supply chain.""Story continuesBut as the Federal Reserve mulls a pause on rate hikes, the economy might get back to normal, giving a boost to the materials sector. In December, Goldman Sachs predicted that commodities could give investors over 40% returns in 2023. The firm at the time said that it was expecting the first quarter to be “bumpy” for the sector amid weakness in China and the US. However, the firm was expecting the sector to benefit from the shortage of commodities after the first quarter.Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Shane Cottle on UnsplashMethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked 13 basic materials stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

Some pressure downward on siloxanes pricing in China from new capacity additions there. But I think we’re starting to see that the demand is picking up and that should help smooth things out. So you also saw higher net sales in coatings and monomers and also higher volumes. Some of its supply availability, as I mentioned in silicones and siloxanes, the other is getting ready for seasonally higher volumes going into the second quarter.And then we think we’ll see more of a traditional seasonal pickup in the coatings and monomers segment. Some pressure on architectural coatings, but industrial coatings are looking relatively strong.

71,7d9255b1-3bf2-365a-9602-aac15a4c19cc,PPG,2023-05-23,What Makes ArcelorMittal (MT) Stock a Solid Choice Right Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-arcelormittal-mt-stock-solid-121600058.html,1684757760,STORY,"['MT.AS', 'MT', 'NUE', 'PPG', 'LIN']","[ArcelorMittal’s MT stock looks promising at the moment. The company is expected to benefit from improved market conditions, expansion moves and cost-improvement actions. We are positive on the company’s prospects and believe that the time is right for you to add the stock to portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.ArcelorMittal has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best investment opportunities for investors.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that make this steel giant an attractive choice for investors right now.Estimates NorthboundOver the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ArcelorMittal for 2023 has increased around 37.5%. The consensus estimate for 2024 has also been revised 7.8% upward over the same time frame. The favorable estimate revisions instill investor confidence in the stock.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryArcelorMittal’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 99.8%.Valuation Looks AttractiveArcelorMittal’s shares are currently trading at a level that is lower than the industry average, suggesting that the stock still has upside potential.Going by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, which is often used to value steel stocks, ArcelorMittal is currently trading at trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 2.37, cheaper compared with the industry average of 6.07.Growth Drivers in PlaceArcelorMittal is expected to benefit from improved demand conditions in 2023 following aggressive destocking. Apparent demand conditions improved once the destocking phase reached its maturity in the first quarter of 2023. The company stated that the absence of further destocking is likely to maintain stronger apparent demand in 2023 compared to 2022. It sees world apparent steel consumption, excluding China, to rise by 2-3% year over year in 2023. ArcelorMittal also expects its steel shipments to grow by roughly 5% year over year in 2023.Moreover, the company is expanding its steel-making capacity and remains focused on shifting to high-added-value products. As part of this move, ArcelorMittal is expanding its automotive steel line of products. The company is expanding its global portfolio of automotive steels by launching a new generation of advanced high-strength steelsThe company’s cost-improvement initiatives will also support profitability. MT, in 2022, set out a new value plan worth $1.5 billion to maintain cost position, to be achieved over three years. The plan is focused on creating value through commercial and operational improvements. These include volume, mix and variable cost improvement. The company realized improvements of $0.4 billion from actions taken in 2022.The recent acquisition of Companhia Siderurgica do Pecem (“CSP”) in Brazil also brings the opportunity for further expansions, including the potential to boost primary steelmaking capacity (including direct reduced iron) and rolling and finishing capacity. Moreover, it offers significant operational and financial synergies. Given its location, CSP also offers an opportunity to establish a new center for producing low-carbon steel, capitalizing on the state of Ceara's desire to establish a low-cost, green hydrogen hub in Pecem.Story continues ArcelorMittal Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseArcelorMittal Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseArcelorMittal price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | ArcelorMittal Quote Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include Nucor Corporation NUE, PPG Industries, Inc.

INSP is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its product innovations. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and a few regulatory approvals are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding overdependence on the Inspire system and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 74.1% against the industry’s 26.4% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 5.9% growth.The renowned medical technology company focused on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has a market capitalization of $8.99 billion. The company projects 26.3% growth for 2023 and expects to maintain its strong performance. Inspire Medical delivered an earnings surprise of 43.3% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Product Innovation: We are optimistic about Inspire Medical’s commitment to driving innovation, which has allowed it to achieve continuous, significant improvements in its Inspire therapy. On the first-quarter earnings call, management confirmed that the company had been continuing operational and production qualification as well as integration with the Inspire digital tools, specifically sleep sync.On the same call, management also stated that Inspire Medical’s SleepSync system continues to progress well since the launch of the Bluetooth-enabled patient remote.Regulatory Approvals: We are upbeat about Inspire Medical’s receipt of a slew of FDA approvals over the past few months. In March, the company received the FDA’s approval to offer Inspire therapy to pediatric patients with Down syndrome. The same month, Inspire Medical announced that it had received countrywide reimbursement approval in Belgium, effective immediately, at rates consistent with other countries around the world for the Inspire therapy.Strong Q1 Results: Inspire Medical’s solid first-quarter 2023 results buoy our optimism. The company recorded a robust improvement in the top line and strength in year-over-year geographic results. Activation of new U.S. centers and the creation of new U.S. sales territories were also recorded during the reported quarter.Story continuesDownsidesOverdependence on the Inspire System: Sales of Inspire Medical’s Inspire system accounted for primarily all its revenues in the past few years. The company’s ability to execute its growth strategy and become profitable will, therefore, depend upon the adoption of the Inspire therapy to treat moderate-to-severe OSA in patients who are unable to use or get consistent benefits from continuous positive airway pressure. Management cannot ensure that the company’s Inspire therapy will achieve or maintain broad market acceptance among physicians and patients.Stiff Competition: The medical technology industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Inspire Medical’s competitors have historically dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to promote their products or develop new products or methods to treat moderate-to-severe OSA.Estimate TrendInspire Medical has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for loss per share has narrowed from $1.32 to $1.18.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $137.5 million, suggesting a 50.5% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

HOLX recently announced the receipt of the FDA 501(k) approval for its Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay. The multiplexed respiratory test is available in the United States with new RespDirect collection kit.Hologic has sent more than 200 million SARS-CoV-2 laboratory diagnostic tests around the world since the COVID epidemic started. Following the July 2022 news of the CE certification for the same test in Europe, the FDA's approval of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay strengthens Hologic's position as one of the biggest molecular diagnostic firms in the world.The latest development will likely bolster Hologic’s Molecular Diagnostics business.More on Panther Fusion AssayThe Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay is done using the fully-automated, high-throughput Panther Fusion system, which can process more than 1,000 tests in a 24-hour period and gives preliminary results in about three hours.This system's adaptability, combined with Hologic's respiratory virus menu, provides a variety of testing possibilities from a single sample and enables laboratories and healthcare practitioners to tailor patient testing depending on medical history and regional prevalence.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis assay is a molecular diagnostic test that distinguishes between the four most common respiratory viruses, including the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A, influenza B and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Benefits of the Panther Fusion AssayThe Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay debuts with the new RespDirectTM collection kit, which enables laboratories to directly load samples for processing on the Panther Fusion system without any uncapping or specimen transfer steps, saving time and lowering the risk of error, repetitive stress injuries and virus exposure.A number of respiratory infections, including COVID, the flu and RSV, circulated concurrently throughout communities this past winter and frequently displayed identical symptoms, making diagnostics challenging. Per Hologic’s management, the Panther Fusion assay will be a vital tool in assisting doctors in figuring out, which respiratory virus or coinfection patients are carrying that will help them decide on the best course of therapy.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer Grand View Research, the global respiratory disease testing/diagnostics market size was valued at $5.0 billion in 2016 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.3% by 2025. The rising rate of pollutants in the air and the release of hazardous gases causing lung diseases including COPD and other respiratory diseases around the world is driving the market.Progress Within Molecular Diagnostics BusinessIn Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics continues to register strong growth during fiscal second quarter. The growth was driven by BVCVTV vaginitis panel and aided by the core STI menu, including Clemidiagonrhia, HPV and Trich. The company witnessed strong contributions from Biotheranostics and respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion during the quarter.The company’s expanded global installed base of Panthers, over 3,250 strong represents the catalyst for the division's sustained growth. The superior workflow of the Panther combined with a broad menu of nearly 20 FDA-approved assays across the Panther and Panther Fusion systems, creates tremendous value for customers and differentiates us from competitors.Price PerformanceIn the past year, Hologic’s shares inched up 3.4% compared with the industry’s fall of 2.4%.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksHologic currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Addus Homecare Corporation ADUS, Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

The streaming residual check amounted to one-third of the $12,000 Jones received in residuals for writing one episode of the ABC drama ""Queens.""Jones said she knew it would be lower than broadcast networks paid in residuals. ""But I didn’t know it would be that bad.""Residuals have emerged as a central issue in the strike by 11,500 members of the Writers Guild of America, who are seeking better compensation and staffing commitments from Hollywood’s studios.The writers argue that streaming services, which upended decades of television industry business practices, have significantly undercut their compensation. They say they aim to recover lost income, in part, by proposing streaming payments that take into account the number of times an episode is viewed, and the number of subscribers outside the U.S.The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the group negotiating on behalf of the studios, says streaming has been a boon for writers, giving them more opportunities for assignments and allowing them to earn income on shows that were canceled or would not otherwise reach syndication.When broadcast networks dominated the living room, writers saw multiple paydays. In addition to their weekly salaries, they would receive a script fee for each episode they wrote, then collect reuse payments known as residuals every time that show aired again, often over the summer months.Once a show reached the 100-episode mark, it could be sold into syndication, filling up daytime programming schedules for local television stations, rerunning on cable networks or outside of the United States. Writers would receive a check every time their episodes appeared on a TV screen.Story continuesRESIDUALS WERE 'VERY HEALTHY'Streaming changed the compensation structure and now accounts for the largest share of TV residuals.“We used to get very healthy residuals. A writer might go a year without work or maybe two and you would be able to live off those residuals, comfortably, and you'd still get paid for the work that you have done,” said Kristine Huntley, who worked as a writer and producer on the AppleTV+ series “Surfside Girls.”Those numbers have ""come down so low that, where you would get maybe a five-figure residual now you might get a three-figure residual,” she said.Writers still collect weekly paychecks and per-episode writing fees, though streaming series typically have fewer episodes per season - meaning fewer opportunities to receive a writing credit, and lower compensation.With streaming, residual payments are not based on the number of times an episode is viewed. Rather, there is a fixed annual fee that takes into account the number of subscribers, with Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ paying more to writers.One studio executive said writers negotiated a 46% increase in residuals for streaming programs, starting in 2022. Those fatter checks are just kicking in now. Another industry source, who also requested anonymity, said residuals reached an all-time high last year, with almost 45% coming from streaming, the lion’s share from Netflix.The latest guild proposal would bump foreign streaming residuals by 200%, a number studio executives noted fails to recognize that subscription fees vary from country to country.The guild says it is looking to close the gap in domestic and international residual payments.Netflix currently pays a $20,018 residual for a one-hour episode that plays in the United States, but one-third of that amount for the same episode to be streamed by more than 150 million global subscribers.Over her decade-plus career as a Hollywood writer, Leila Cohan has worked on network TV shows and streaming series, including as co-executive producer on Netflix’s popular period drama “Bridgerton.”“Bridgerton” is one of Netflix’s most-watched series, though the lower-profile MTV Network comedy “Awkward” produced higher residual payments for Cohan, who wrote five episodes over the show’s final two seasons.“It wasn’t enough residuals to live off of, but a pretty healthy supplement,” said Cohan. “Even now, I still get a couple thousand from it a year.”“Bridgerton,” with its eight-episode seasons, led to a single writing credit in 2020, and a royalty check that Cohan said did not reflect the show’s importance to Netflix.“Residuals are meant to be some level of profit sharing,” Cohan said. “If 'Bridgerton' is one of the most successful shows, and it’s bringing a huge number of subscribers to Netflix or helping them keep their subscribers, I do think I should be compensated for that value.”(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Rollo Ross in Los Angeles; Editing by Mary Milliken and Bill Berkrot)]"

""But I didn’t know it would be that bad.""Residuals have emerged as a central issue in the strike by 11,500 members of the Writers Guild of America, who are seeking better compensation and staffing commitments from Hollywood’s studios.The writers argue that streaming services, which upended decades of television industry business practices, have significantly undercut their compensation. They say they aim to recover lost income, in part, by proposing streaming payments that take into account the number of times an episode is viewed, and the number of subscribers outside the U.S.The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the group negotiating on behalf of the studios, says streaming has been a boon for writers, giving them more opportunities for assignments and allowing them to earn income on shows that were canceled or would not otherwise reach syndication.When broadcast networks dominated the living room, writers saw multiple paydays. In addition to their weekly salaries, they would receive a script fee for each episode they wrote, then collect reuse payments known as residuals every time that show aired again, often over the summer months.Once a show reached the 100-episode mark, it could be sold into syndication, filling up daytime programming schedules for local television stations, rerunning on cable networks or outside of the United States. Writers would receive a check every time their episodes appeared on a TV screen.Story continuesRESIDUALS WERE 'VERY HEALTHY'Streaming changed the compensation structure and now accounts for the largest share of TV residuals.“We used to get very healthy residuals. A writer might go a year without work or maybe two and you would be able to live off those residuals, comfortably, and you'd still get paid for the work that you have done,” said Kristine Huntley, who worked as a writer and producer on the AppleTV+ series “Surfside Girls.”Those numbers have ""come down so low that, where you would get maybe a five-figure residual now you might get a three-figure residual,” she said.Writers still collect weekly paychecks and per-episode writing fees, though streaming series typically have fewer episodes per season - meaning fewer opportunities to receive a writing credit, and lower compensation.With streaming, residual payments are not based on the number of times an episode is viewed. Rather, there is a fixed annual fee that takes into account the number of subscribers, with Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ paying more to writers.One studio executive said writers negotiated a 46% increase in residuals for streaming programs, starting in 2022. Those fatter checks are just kicking in now. Another industry source, who also requested anonymity, said residuals reached an all-time high last year, with almost 45% coming from streaming, the lion’s share from Netflix.The latest guild proposal would bump foreign streaming residuals by 200%, a number studio executives noted fails to recognize that subscription fees vary from country to country.The guild says it is looking to close the gap in domestic and international residual payments.Netflix currently pays a $20,018 residual for a one-hour episode that plays in the United States, but one-third of that amount for the same episode to be streamed by more than 150 million global subscribers.Over her decade-plus career as a Hollywood writer, Leila Cohan has worked on network TV shows and streaming series, including as co-executive producer on Netflix’s popular period drama “Bridgerton.”“Bridgerton” is one of Netflix’s most-watched series, though the lower-profile MTV Network comedy “Awkward” produced higher residual payments for Cohan, who wrote five episodes over the show’s final two seasons.“It wasn’t enough residuals to live off of, but a pretty healthy supplement,” said Cohan. “Even now, I still get a couple thousand from it a year.”“Bridgerton,” with its eight-episode seasons, led to a single writing credit in 2020, and a royalty check that Cohan said did not reflect the show’s importance to Netflix.“Residuals are meant to be some level of profit sharing,” Cohan said. “If 'Bridgerton' is one of the most successful shows, and it’s bringing a huge number of subscribers to Netflix or helping them keep their subscribers, I do think I should be compensated for that value.” (Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Rollo Ross in Los Angeles; Editing by Mary Milliken and Bill Berkrot)]"

The company offers investors international exposure to this strong industry with Arcos operating as a franchisee of McDonald’s in Brazil and across various parts of Latin America and the Caribbean.Earnings of $0.18 per share came in 50% above Q1 EPS expectations of $0.12. More intriguing, Arcos' outlook and annual growth look attractive at the moment. With shares of ARCO trading around $9, annual earnings are now forecasted to be up 4% in fiscal 2023 and jump another 13% in FY24 at $0.82 per share. Even better, earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher over the last 60 days which could be a further catalyst for Arcos stock.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEagle Materials (EXP)With the Building Products-Concrete and Aggregates Industry in the top 6% of all Zacks industries, Eagle Materials stock is standing out with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).As a manufacturer and distributor of cement, concrete, and aggregates, Eagle appears to be benefiting from its strong business environment with the company blasting its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings expectations last Thursday.Eagle’s Q4 EPS of $2.79 crushed earnings estimates of $2.35 per share by 19%. Annual earnings are now forecasted to be up 1% in Eagle’s current fiscal 2024 and jump another 11% in FY25 at $14.11 per share. Fiscal 2025 earnings projections represent a very stellar 105% EPS growth over the last five years with 2021 earnings at $6.86 per share. Plus, earnings estimate revisions have gone up over the last week folliwng Eagle's Q4 report.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe TJX Companies (TJX)The TJX Companies is one of the notable retailers sticking out at the moment with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and its Retail-Discount Stores Industry is in Zacks top 50%.As a leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions TJX comfortably topped its Q1 earnings expectations last Wednesday. First-quarter earnings of $0.76 per share beat EPS estimates by 7%. This was despite a very slight miss on the top line.Still, TJX’s outlook is starting to brighten and this should continue as inflationary concerns keep easing. To that point, annual earnings are anticipated to jump 14% in FY23 and rise another 10% in FY24 at $3.92 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayThe EPS projectory of these stocks is attractive at the moment especially with many businesses still dealing with slowing growth in correlation with high inflation.

The retail earnings roundup continues this week following last week's mixed picture with Costco, Lowe's, and Best Buy all on tap for this week. So what should investors expect? Yahoo Finance's Josh Shafer joins us now. Josh, what are we watching for?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Brad, so I want to start by just going over what we saw last week and what we can learn from that and maybe sort of look for going into this week. And I think the biggest story out of last week was are not seeing a slowdown yet. People are talking about a slowdown, but when you look at those same-store sales numbers from some of the big companies that reported last week, these are not down from last year.You see Target up nearly 1% when you're talking about brick-and-mortar stores. Walmart was up over 7%. TJX up about 3%. So we had talked a lot even last week in anticipation of these earnings, basically saying, is the slowdown already happening? It is not already happening. So we're curious about what we hear moving forward and specifically when we think about what we heard from Walmart what we hear from a trade-down perspective.I think that's going to be some of the interesting companies to watch this week when you think about a BJ's is reporting, Dollar Tree, Costco. Are they saying that they think higher-income consumers are trading down because that is something that we heard from Walmart last week?- Yeah, definitely. And also, the companies that are more weighted towards grocery seem to be better. The ones that are more discretionary-based are not doing as well. Foot Locker is really a prime example. Got killed on Friday, and then there's some analysts chatter continuing this morning that's not very positive.JOSH SCHAFER: And you're curious, what does that mean for Dick's Sporting Goods. How different is the business? And I think the business, from at least what analysts expect going into Dick's report is it is a very different business. When you think about what Dick's has already been able to build out from a private brand perspective when you think about what Dick's has been able to do as far as getting rid of inventory being in a wholesale spot.Story continuesI think Foot Locker is an interesting company to think about when we talk about a consumer slowdown because Foot Locker is trying to rebrand right now. They were already in the process of trying to change what they're doing. You do that, well, you already have uncertainty in the overall economy.It's going to be tough to try and rebuild same-store sales growth when you're not even sure if people that have been coming into stores are going to be coming into stores. And I think that's what puts Foot Locker in kind of a unique struggling position here.- Yeah, well, we'll see how the stock continues to doing Dick's to your point. A lot of suspense there. Going to be interesting. Thanks, Josh. Appreciate it.]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Now.The basic materials industry is huge and includes major segments like oil, metals &amp; mining, chemicals, and other raw materials. The industry often remains in flux amid changing oil and commodity prices. Oil companies account for a major chunk of the basic materials industry. Major oil stocks like ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum are trading in the red this year amid fears of a slowing economy and recession. This lackluster performance of oil companies comes after a huge outperformance of the energy sector last year.Pessimism Around ChinaThe biggest factor that is denting the performance of many energy and commodities companies this year is the pessimism surrounding Chinese economic growth. Earlier this year the market cheered the reopening of China. The world was expecting the demand for commodities to surge as Chinese factories and industries fire up. But the economic growth in China remains slower than expected.For April, China’s indicator of manufacturing activity declined to 49.2 from the previous month’s 51.9 reading. On April 25, copper prices fell to their five-week lows after data indicated a slower-than-expected rebound in activity in China and rising inventors at the London Metal Exchange warehouse system.Talking about the reopening dynamics in China and how it’s affecting iron ore, steel prices and related business of the company, Vale’s management said the following in its latest earnings call:""So we’ve been seeing the recovery in China. Definitely we have strong numbers. You mentioned that GDP FAI very resilient, infrastructure investment properties, we have good news also. So the bright side that we are in the stocking mall in China. So, we see the sales increasing also the accomplishment of construction also increase. You mentioned all the micro numbers, blast furnace going well, we just came from China. It’s a common sense that production will be flat this year. So the production is there. So what is concerning today, so, the first thing is related to property. It is a cycle. So we firstly we need to sell, finish the construction. So land sales and new starts are coming.So that didn’t come yet. So that’s the main volatility that we see in our — even in our clients. They are in a wait and see mode. But everybody’s waiting that for only for the second half. So we are on track and we need to wait for that. I think price in steel, it’s another concern. But the good news is, if you see the export that you had in China, this quarter. That implies that we have a symmetry in the price, ex-China comparing to China. So there is a wind that can help China to improve the price in the steel market. And as a combination of all of this, we have a tepid or really tepid margins steel mill. So with all this, we have this wait and see behavior, we have old inventors are really low. So in our perspective in short-term, we can see a rebound, we have this next holiday that is coming out and they will need to replenish the supply chain.""Story continuesBut as the Federal Reserve mulls a pause on rate hikes, the economy might get back to normal, giving a boost to the materials sector. In December, Goldman Sachs predicted that commodities could give investors over 40% returns in 2023. The firm at the time said that it was expecting the first quarter to be “bumpy” for the sector amid weakness in China and the US. However, the firm was expecting the sector to benefit from the shortage of commodities after the first quarter.Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Shane Cottle on UnsplashMethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked 13 basic materials stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

So that was part of the impact. The other thing you would see in silicones was that, pricing and demand held up relatively well. Some pressure downward on siloxanes pricing in China from new capacity additions there. But I think we’re starting to see that the demand is picking up and that should help smooth things out. So you also saw higher net sales in coatings and monomers and also higher volumes. Some of its supply availability, as I mentioned in silicones and siloxanes, the other is getting ready for seasonally higher volumes going into the second quarter.And then we think we’ll see more of a traditional seasonal pickup in the coatings and monomers segment. Some pressure on architectural coatings, but industrial coatings are looking relatively strong. And I think we’ll have to watch carefully what’s going on with housing starts and housing sales and see how that impacts architectural coatings through the quarter."" Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested articles:10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Fast Food Stocks to Invest In15 Most Tax-Friendly Countries in EuropeDisclosure: None. 13 Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

97,2e45f54c-beef-3abe-98ab-40cf3b01eac8,M,2023-05-23,Multi-brand retailers 'much better positioned' than traditional retail: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/multi-brand-retailers-much-better-145449847.html,1684767289,VIDEO,"['M', 'TGT', 'WMT']","[Coresight Research CEO Deborah Weinswig joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the state of the consumer, multi-brand retailers, what to expect from upcoming retail earnings reports, and retail inventory.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: For more on what to expect from retailers this week, we're joined by Deborah Weinberg, Coresight Research CEO. Deb, good to see you. Thanks for being here. Can you hear us OK?DEBORAH WEINSWIG: Perfect.JULIE HYMAN: OK. Excellent. So talk to us about-- are we going to continue to see this sort of differentiation from between staples and discretionary, and how is that going to play out in the companies that we've yet to hear from?DEBORAH WEINSWIG: Well, I think not only are we seeing a difference between the staples retailers and discretionary retailers. We're also seeing a difference between the higher end and let's say the kind of opening price point, right, with Tapestry a few weeks ago talking about how they're seeing, kind of, no price resistances. They're raising prices, yet we are definitely seeing, I would say, a bit of a trade down as Walmart referred to it.So I think it definitely depends kind of what sector you're in. And if we look at like a TJ Ross Burlington, kind of, that off price, there's certainly a lot of interest from the consumer there, foot traffic, and also conversion.BRAD SMITH: OK. And so-- I mean, we've already seen-- in terms of some of the retail sales data that's come through as well, Deb-- that it's not looking great for some of the more specialty retailers, especially considering sporting goods hobby musical instruments bookstores month-over-month they declined by about 3.3%. So what does that set up mean-- even in terms of the month over month from March to April-- how could that translate into their own earnings results that they saw, too?DEBORAH WEINSWIG: Yeah. I think specialty is definitely facing some challenges. I do think that if we look at some of these alternative revenue streams-- I believe in March of 23 that Gap backed away from retail media and advertising services-- and so this has been another kind of revenue stream for the likes of Walmart, Target, Macy's, Kroger-- Amazon I think led the way, but these multi-brand retailers, I believe, are much better positioned because they are finding other revenue streams outside of traditional retail.Story continuesSo whether it's data monetization, whether it's retail media, whether it's selling their IP, it's one of the reasons we've been so constructive on multi-brand retail. But it's a very, very important point that we would be in the, let's say, kind of outside of the masstige stage to luxury price range-- like a Tapestry-- is why we would be more concerned around the specialty retail retailers right now.JULIE HYMAN: I'm curious about department stores as well. I mean, we've been talking a little bit about Macy's, and it's what-- 28% slump or something this year, and how they're going to fare in this environment when people are really, sort of, battening down the hatches.DEBORAH WEINSWIG: I mean, I think that Macy's does deliver overall great value and ultimately ends up being almost the same price as you would pay at a TJ Ross Burlington, but it's, kind of, a coupon on top of deal on top of-- right. It can-- there's a lack of transparency sometimes to the consumer. And so I do think that there continues to be an opportunity for them on the marketing side and also kind of how they communicate to their customers and a loyalty program, et cetera.So I do think that they are challenged from that perspective. And also with some of the-- I think we have to say it, right-- the organized retail crime that Target talked about last week. There are some retailers who are definitely having more of a challenge with that than others.BRAD SMITH: When we hear about mix shifts from some of the largest retailers in the US like target, like Walmart, how might those mix shifts show up in the earnings results that are still set to come forward this week, knowing that those mixed shifts have actually meant consumers are perhaps just leaning more into the necessities that they need to purchase from those other retailers?DEBORAH WEINSWIG: I think you're definitely continuing to see this kind of movement into more necessity. Some of the, kind of, government support was pulled back in the last quarter. I think we're starting to see that show up. And I think that the consumers, while we're not necessarily as it was-- as you said earlier-- we're not seeing like a slowdown. I think everyone's just a bit more tepid.So-- and we also have-- we look at goods and services, right. The consumer is also kind of redirecting some of their discretionary spend towards services. And I think that in that environment that you either have to have, kind of, a really strong brand like a Tapestry, and the consumer is kind of trading up in some cases. But I think that when it comes to the necessities, that the consumer is watching what they spend. So this frugality almost, right. They are treating themselves, right, to a trip, to a vacation, to whatnot. But when it comes to day to day spending-- this is, I think, the key-- they are definitely, kind of, counting their pennies and being a bit more careful.And where there are strong loyalty programs, where there's personalization, where there's customization, there are ways that we're seeing some of these retailers win. And some of the names, right-- Target, Walmart, Kroger-- they're really-- I mean they have, kind of, in the show earlier, right-- they have a lot of data on their consumer, right. They're just bigger retailers. I think they're able to do a much better job of delivering that customized experience, which I think is starting to show up in a bigger way in market share gains, but also gains in terms of where the consumer is spending their time, their money and their mindshare.JULIE HYMAN: And then another story, another thread in all of the retail earnings is inventories, which now seem to be getting more right sized, right. This is something our Seana Smith wrote about. It's on the Yahoo Finance platform. How does that position the retailers for the second half of the year with now inventories being more lean? Is that a good thing? Does it mean that they'll be able to weather things a little bit better?DEBORAH WEINSWIG: I mean, to me, holiday 21 was on record the most profitable holiday season we've ever seen because inventories were so light. You know, retailers felt that they missed out on sales, so they went the other direction for holiday 22. We're still working down unbelievably some of that inventory, and there still is inventory, kind of, that they haven't taken on to their books yet that is sitting in factories, warehouses, 3PL centers, so I do want to just be somewhat cautious.We are definitely in a much better position than we were for holiday 22. The stores will be more pleasant to shop. We won't see that very aggressive, kind of, I would say markdown cadence, so it won't be this rush to the bottom I think. We are seeing pricing power. I actually think that is one of the most important things. As we talked today, [INAUDIBLE] earnings season so far.And I think the positive is, for two age, that we will see much cleaner inventory levels, which will be just a better experience, but also we won't see all this aggressive discounting that we saw last year. So I do think it's a positive I just do want to be cautious that there are still higher inventory levels. It's just not on the retailer's books just yet.BRAD SMITH: To what extent does credit card spending right now in data that's been amassed even by the New York Fed signal that this is a consumer that's very much bracing for-- and perhaps some of them already experiencing-- the early moments of a recession.DEBORAH WEINSWIG: You know, it's interesting. Kind of coming out of March 10, SVD, many of us in the kind of retail consumer space were concerned about the consumer. And every additional data point I would say does make one a bit more cautious, but we continue to see spending, honestly, at a level higher than I would have expected in May of 23. But I would say from a debt perspective, from a, sort of, where we're seeing the consumer pull back-- I mean, there are definitely signs that they are more cautious, and that they're debt-- personal consumer debt-- is building.I would just say I think that we all need to of keep our eye in terms of one or more caution, but that don't count this consumer out yet. They really have, I think, exceeded all expectations to date. And it does seem that while we all continue to, kind of, debate recession over cession, this consumer has definitely continue to spend on goods and services at a higher level than many of us would have expected. And, you know, I'm not counting them out just yet.JULIE HYMAN: Truth. Deborah Weinswig, thanks so much. Our Coresight Research CEO. Thanks so much.]"

These 7 Retail Stocks Are Ready for Their Comeback.,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/surprise-7-retail-stocks-ready-121211931.html,1684411931,STORY,"['GPS', 'NKE', 'WMT', 'LULU', 'M', 'COST']","[Retail stocks haven’t been lighting the world on fire lately. The SPDR S&amp;P Retail Exchange-Traded Fund (NYSEARCA:XRT) that tracks the sector is flat on the year (down 0.30% since January). Investors and traders seem to be taking a “wait-and-see” approach to retail stocks as the U.S. economy and consumer spending slow in the wake of persistently high inflation and elevated interest rates used to lower it.Fears of a coming economic recession are also dampening sentiment around retail stocks. This is unfortunate, as many retailers continue to post strong earnings and have shown great resilience both during the Covid-19 pandemic and throughout the current period of uncertainty. Investors might be surprised at just how strong the underlying fundamentals of many retail stocks are right now.With that said, here are seven retail stocks that are ready for their comeback.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLULULululemon$372.22NKENike$116.98GPSGap Inc.$7.78WMTWalmart$149.53MMacy’s$15.61DKSDick’s Sporting Goods$135.46COSTCostco$495.00Lululemon (LULU)the lululemon (LULU) logo on a mosaic-style wallSource: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.comShares of athletic apparel retailer Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) have been on an upswing since the company issued its latest quarterly earnings at the end of March. LULU stock jumped 15% immediately after the report, as the company issued an across the board earnings beat. Accordingly, LULU stock has seen its share price rise 27% since then. After enduring a bruising 2022, Lululemon’s stock has now managed to rise 22% above where it was trading at a year ago.The company said that strong holiday sales helped it to report earnings per share of $4.40 versus $4.26 that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue in the three months ended January 29 of this year came in at $2.77 billion compared to $2.70 billion that analysts had forecast. Lululemon also issued strong forward guidance, saying it now expects fiscal 2023 revenue of between $9.3 billion and $9.41 billion. That was better than Wall Street consensus expectations of $9.14 billion, according to Refinitiv data. The stock continues to recover.Story continuesNike (NKE)Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocksSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comThey haven’t staged a recovery like the one seen in LULU stock, but shares of Nike (NYSE:NKE) appear due for a rebound. The frustrating thing about NKE stock is that it has continued to trend lower, despite a string of earnings beat by the company. Year to date, NKE stock is down 2% and the shares are trading 12% below their 52-week high. This despite the fact that Nike’s latest earnings easily beat Wall Street’s forecasts on both the top and bottom lines.At the end of March, Nike reported earnings per share of 79 cents versus 55 cents that was expected by analysts who cover the company. Nike’s revenue in the quarter totaled $12.39 billion compared to $11.47 billion that had been forecast.What seems to be holding the company’s stock down are weak sales in China and bloated inventory levels. Should Nike show improvement in those areas when it next reports earnings on June 28, the stock is likely to pop and finally move higher.Gap Inc. (GPS)GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a buildingSource: ShutterstockRetailer Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS) has had an extremely difficult time in recent months. The clothing company has seen its share price decline 33% year-to-date after it reported a net loss of $273 million, or 75 cents a share, for the three months ended January 28 of this year. The latest loss was 1,600% bigger than the $16 million the company lost a year earlier. In the wake of the brutal quarter, Gap announced several changes within its executive ranks, and that it plans to close 50 to 55 Gap and Banana Republic retail stores across North America.The company went onto forecast that it expects fiscal first quarter net sales to decrease in the mid-single digit range compared to a year earlier, and that it anticipates fiscal 2023 net sales to decrease in the low to mid-single digits. While disheartening, there are some bright spots on the horizon. The company reported that its inventory levels declined 21% year-over-year during its most recent quarter. And Gap is expected to soon announce a new permanent CEO to replace Sonia Syngal, who stepped down last summer.Walmart (WMT)Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWalmart (NYSE:WMT) stock has been treading water over the last year, having risen only 1% over the past 12 months. However, WMT stock could be poised for a breakout when the world’s biggest retailer reports its latest earnings on May 18.The company is coming off strong sales at the end of 2022, especially during the December holiday season. Additionally, the company’s discount pricing model positions it to perform strongly should the U.S. economy enter a recession this year.In it previous earnings, Walmart said its revenue and earnings were driven higher by budget-conscious consumers who are visiting its stores in greater numbers, searching for deals as inflation and interest rates remain high. As a result, Walmart reported earnings per share of $1.71 versus the $1.51 that was forecast. Revenue amounted to $164.05 billion, compared to $159.72 billion that was expected among analysts. Looking ahead, the retailer forecast same-store sales for all of this year to rise between 2% and 2.5%.Walmart is not only the biggest retailer in America, but has also become a grocery powerhouse, which is driving increased foot traffic at its outlets.Macy’s (M)Macy's (M) logo on storefront in city with white sky behindSource: Joe Tabacca / Shutterstock.comDepartment store chain Macy’s (NYSE:M) is another retail stock that’s down on its luck. So far this year, M stock has decreased 27%. Notably, the company’s share price is also down 56% over five years.While disappointing, hope arrives for Macy’s shareholders in the form of new management at the company. It was announced at the end of March that CEO Jeff Gennette will retire after more than 40 years at the retailer. Gennette, age 61, plans to step down in February 2024 and will be succeeded by Tony Spring, CEO of the company’s Bloomingdale’s chain.When Gennette became Macy’s CEO in 2017, he undertook a three-year turnaround strategy called “Polaris” that accelerated Macy’s digital growth, closed underperforming stores, and boosted profits as the company faced mounting competition from online retailers. However, the Covid-19 pandemic undid much of the turnaround strategy, as it forced Macy’s to temporarily close its nearly 800 store locations, and operate at reduced capacity. However, Macy’s today has a smaller workforce and network of stores, along with less debt and more online customers after the pandemic.Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS)An image of a Dick's Sporting Goods retail locationSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comShares of Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) has been trending higher since the sporting goods retailer more than doubled its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders in March of this year. The company announced that it will pay a dividend of $1 per share going forward, which is an increase of 105% from the 48.75 cents paid previously. The dividend increase came after Dick’s smashed expectations for its fourth-quarter 2022 earnings.The company’s same-store sales rose 5.3%, more than double analysts’ consensus forecasts of 2.1% growth, according to Refinitiv data. Additionally, earnings per share came in at $2.93 versus $2.88 that analysts had expected. The retailer said it has kept sales brisk despite inflationary pressures and a slowing economy. The company also said it expects same-store sales growth for the current fiscal year to be flat or up 2%, adding that it has resolved most of its supply chain issues.Year to date, DKS stock has gained 9%. Dick’s Sporting Goods next reports earnings on May 23.Costco (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comLast on this list of retail stocks to buy is another top name that’s been drifting sideways. Over the last year, shares of Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock have increased a paltry 1%. The best-in-class grocery retailer is definitely due for a breakout. That could come after the company reports earnings on May 25.Concerns around slowing growth coming out of the pandemic have slowed down the company’s upward stock price momentum. Additionally, Costco’s pricey valuation has turned some investors off. Its price-earnings ratio currently sits at 36-times, which is on the high side.However, investors and analysts may be overlooking the fact that Costco is a recession-resistant stock, meaning the company’s sales are likely to remain strong even during an economic downturn. Costco’s membership fees also provide it with a reliable income stream and earnings stability in good times and bad. Consumers are also fiercely loyal to Costco as evidenced by the fact that its annual membership renewal rate exceeds 90%. And, consumers have further relied on Costco over the past year for cheaper gasoline than they can get at other service stations.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

This implies a year-over-year increase of 140.84%.NRG Energy’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is currently pinned at 6.5%.Return on EquityReturn on equity (ROE) indicates how efficiently a company has been utilizing the funds to generate higher returns. Currently, NRG’s ROE is 17.12%, higher than the industry’s average of 6.16%. This indicates that the company has been utilizing the funds more constructively than its peers in the utility electric power industry.Dividend Growth &amp; Repurchase ProgramNRG Energy increases shareholders’ value through share repurchases and dividend payment. Over the last five years, the company has increased its dividend four times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 96.41%. In April 2023, its board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 37.75 cents per share, resulting in an annualized dividend of $1.51 per share. NRG’s current dividend yield is 4.44%, better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 Composite’s yield of 1.51%.  At present, its dividend payout is 49%.The company’s management had authorized $1 billion for share repurchases in December 2021, of which $645 million has been used till 2022-end.

It does not depend on a single customer for revenues, which adds stability to customer bills and increases earnings predictability.Story continuesPrice PerformanceIn the past three months, the NRG Energy stock has returned 1.3% compared with the industry’s average growth of 0.8%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Stocks to ConsiderA few other top-ranked stocks from the same industry are OGE Energy Corp.

Its dividend policy and share repurchase program will further increase shareholders’ value.However, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has to face risks related to disruptions in its fuel delivery system.TailwindsRecently, NRG completed the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home. Integration efforts for the same are now fully underway. The company defined growth synergy target of $30 million for 2023. It expects growth synergies of $300 million through a target for cross-sell, Vivint organic growth and sales channel optimization. In total, recurring synergies of $400 million are expected to be achieved over the next three years.The company has been consistently increasing its dividend to attract investors. In January 2023, its board of directors approved a quarterly dividend hike of 8%, which is in sync with NRG’s long-term annual dividend growth target rate of 7-9% per share.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.OGE Energy has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while NextEra Energy has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that OGE is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.OGE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.95, while NEE has a forward P/E of 23.97. We also note that OGE has a PEG ratio of 1. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. NEE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.86.Another notable valuation metric for OGE is its P/B ratio of 1.66. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NEE has a P/B of 2.89.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help OGE earn a Value grade of B, while NEE has been given a Value grade of D.OGE is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

This, along with robust assets under management (AUM), solid balance sheet position and global expansion initiatives, will likely drive revenues in the quarters ahead. However, a rise in expenses and concentration risk due to higher dependence on fee-based revenues is worrisome.With the Federal Reserve expected to keep interest rates high in the near term, BK's net interest revenue (NIR) and net interest margin (NIM) are anticipated to improve in the quarters ahead. The company’s NIR and NIM declined in 2020 and 2021 but rebounded solidly in 2022. NIR recorded a four-year (ended 2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.2%. Likewise, NIM improved to 0.97% last year from 0.68% in 2021.Both metrics witnessed an uptrend in the first quarter of 2023. Our estimates for NIR suggest a CAGR of 6.3% over the next three years. Likewise, NIM is expected to be 1.19% in 2023, 1.07% in 2024 and 0.98% in 2025.As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had total debt worth $59.6 billion, significantly lower than its cash and cash equivalents, and due from banks of $122.6 billion. BK maintains investment-grade long-term senior debt ratings of A1/A/AA- and a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, S&amp;P Ratings, and Fitch Ratings, respectively. Thus, with sound liquidity and a manageable debt level, the company is expected to be able to meet its near-term debt obligations even if the economic situation worsens.BK has been trying to improve its market share internationally and is also undertaking several growth initiatives. In 2021, BNY Mellon, through its subsidiary, acquired Optimal Asset Management. The company's international revenues (constituting 35% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2023) are expected to keep improving as the demand for personalized services rises worldwide.Analysts seem pessimistic regarding BK’s earnings growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 and 2024 earnings has been revised marginally lower over the past seven days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).However, BK has been witnessing a persistent rise in expenses over the recent few years. The company’s costs witnessed a CAGR of 6.1% in the last four years (ended 2022), with the uptrend continuing in the first quarter of 2023. Excluding notable items, management anticipates 2023 expenses to increase approximately 4%. While we project non-interest expenses to decline this year, the metric is expected to increase 1.6% in 2024.Story continuesFee income constituted more than 74% of BNY Mellon’s total revenues at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Concentration risk emanating from higher dependence on fee-based revenues could significantly alter the company’s financial position if there is any change in individual investment preferences, regulatory amendments or a slowdown in capital market activities.In the past six months, shares of BNY Mellon have declined 10.1% compared with the industry's 15.4% fall. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Banks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are Pathward Financial, Inc.

There was even a documentary made about the fight between the billionaires. Ironically, Icahn’s firm Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP) is now on the receiving end of an attack by well-known short-seller Hindenburg Research. According to Bloomberg: “Icahn has been using money taken in from new investors to pay out dividends to old investors,” Hindenburg said in the report. “Such Ponzi-like economic structures are sustainable only to the extent that new money is willing to risk being the last one ‘holding the bag.’”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhile I do not include Icahn Enterprises in my list of three stocks that activist investors may need to swoop in and save, you could make the case based on Hindenburg’s report. Instead, I’ve sought out three other names that ought to be on activist investors’ to-do lists. NWLNewell Brands$8.89VFCVF Corporation$20.77TSNTyson Foods$49.97Newell Brands (NWL)A photo of a sign showing the Newell Brands (NWL) logo outside a building.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comOnce upon a time, long before Newell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) became a conglomeration of more than 100 consumer brands, it was a good company. In 1999, Newell Co. acquired Rubbermaid for $5.8 billion in stock after Rubbermaid’s long-time CEO, Stanley Gault, retired. The company went downhill quickly, so Newell pounced. Newell had spent three decades buying over 75 companies. Its game plan has always been to acquire a company, cut costs, raise margins and deliver shareholder value. In the case of Rubbermaid, Newell management said at the time that they would add $300 million to $350 million in operating income by 2000 due to the buyout. In 1997, Newell had operating income of $572 million. By 2000, it had an operating income of $832 million — up $260 million but not quite hitting the mark — on $6.9 billion in revenue. Two decades later, Newell Brands’ 2022 operating income was $312 million, less than half its 2000 figure, on $9.5 billion in revenue. So, while revenue is 38% higher than in 2000, the company is far less profitable. Story continuesIronically, Icahn brokered a deal in April to end a proxy battle with hedge fund Starboard Value. Some other activists ought to pick up the torch. Down 66% in the past five years, Newell could just be the worst stock in the S&amp;P 500.VF Corporation (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comVF Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is an apparel conglomerate with well-known brands such as Vans, Timberland, The North Face, Supreme and Dickies. The company has faced little activism over the years. However, it did take some heat in 2018 when it banned a shareholder from the annual meeting. Other than that, it’s been pretty quiet. However, VF’s stock is in a freefall. Down 25% year to date, 57% over the past year and 72% over the past five years, a $10,000 investment in May 2018 would be worth just $2,800 today. In early May, VFC stock got a bit of a boost when Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow upgraded it from “sell” to “hold,” suggesting that the problems that plagued it were in the rearview mirror. Boruchow also said that its Vans sneaker brand, which until 2022 had been the company’s strongest performer, was on the mend. And he suggested the company’s dividend cut will likely help it fund future growth. That’s all well and good, but when a stock has performed as poorly as VFC, something must be done before shareholders see all of its value evaporate. Perhaps activist investors are the answer.Tyson Foods (TSN)A package of Tyson Foods (TSN) chicken breasts.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comHow is it that Tyson Foods (NYSE: TSN) Chief Financial Officer (CFO) John R. Tyson still has a job while 10% of the company’s corporate staff will lose theirs? Tyson was arrested in November for entering a stranger’s house while intoxicated and sleeping half-naked in one of the bedrooms. Apparently, getting drunk and sleeping it off in the wrong house isn’t cause for dismissal, but being the poor sap whose name is selected out of a hat as part of a job reduction plan is.Tyson is the largest processor of chicken and beef in the U.S. Its brands include Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farms, Ball Park and Sara Lee. The company reported an operating loss in the second quarter of $49 million, down from a $1.16 billion operating profit a year ago. Meanwhile, shares are down nearly 20% YTD, 46% over the past year and more than 26% over the past five years. Like the other two names on my list, you would think activist investors would have a field day with Tyson. It’s got some well-known brands and a key position in America’s food chain, yet it continues to sputter. Unfortunately, the Tyson family has a 20% economic interest in the company and controls 71% of the votes. However, just because you can’t take down the Tysons doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try.        On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:WEC) Shares Could Be 24% Above Their Intrinsic Value Estimate",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wec-energy-group-inc-nyse-131928809.html,1684761568,STORY,['WEC'],"[Key InsightsUsing the Dividend Discount Model, WEC Energy Group fair value estimate is US$72.30WEC Energy Group is estimated to be 24% overvalued based on current share price of US$89.92 The US$102 analyst price target for WEC is 41% more than our estimate of fair valueToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of WEC Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE:WEC) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group The ModelAs WEC Energy Group operates in the integrated utilities sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. Instead of using free cash flows, which are hard to estimate and often not reported by analysts in this industry, dividends per share (DPS) payments are used. Unless a company pays out the majority of its FCF as a dividend, this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. The dividend is expected to grow at an annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We then discount this figure to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%. Relative to the current share price of US$89.9, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.Story continuesValue Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= US$3.4 / (6.9% – 2.1%)= US$72.3dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at WEC Energy Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for WEC Energy GroupStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Integrated Utilities market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

ATP successfully treated 35/52 episodes (67.3%).Shocks were avoided in nearly half of all spontaneous episodes because of the availability of ATP.

For more stocks, head on over to Bill Gates' Most Recent Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Today's age is the information age. If you have a smartphone and an internet connection, you can look up vast amounts of information sufficient to form an informed opinion on a variety of topics. One such topic is global wealth, and one of the most well known billionaires ever since the growth of the internet is Bill Gates.Mr. Gates, responsible for setting up one of the world's largest technology companies, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), has dominated the global rich list for several years. Bill Gates was the first person in human history to cross $100 billion in total worth, during the peak of the dotcom era as Microsoft's shares boomed during the peak of the bubble. Mr. Gates first made it on Forbes' billionaire list in 1987 and became the world's richest person in 1995. This kicked off a period of dominance by Mr. Gates, as he maintained that spot until 2008 when he lost the title to the Mexican business tycoon Carlos Slim. This would be a short lived victory for Mr. Slim, as the Microsoft billionaire would retake the top spot a year later and maintain the position until 2010 to lose the title once again for three years and regain it in 2017. Gates only lost the richest person title after he donated $55 billion of his wealth to the Gates Foundation. Safe to say, for Mr. Gates, being the world's richest person is as normal as filing taxes for the rest of us.These days, Bill Gates is the sixth richest person in the world, and by our estimates, he really couldn't care less. His net worth, according to Forbes Magazine, is $114 billion, and according to the magazine's estimates, $30 billion of this fortune is held in cash. Quite a sizeable bank balance, we'd say. While the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is one of the best known investment vehicles for Mr. Gates, the billionaire also runs his family office called Cascade Investment. Cascade is also managed by the Gates Foundation's manager Michael Larson. Mr. Gates is the only owner of Cascade, and the firm's SEC filings reveal investments in a variety of firms such as AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO), Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL), Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI), and Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE).Story continuesThe foundation of Bill Gates' wealth is built on software. His firm Microsoft is the largest company in the world in terms of market share of the personal computing operating systems market. He has seen the computing industry since its inception, and naturally, this provides him with a unique perspective and insight into the industry. Given the current hype surrounding artificial intelligence, it's relevant to see his take on the matter. Fortunately for us, Mr. Gates shared his thoughts on the matter in March 2023 Microsoft podcast where he outlined:A.I. has always been the holy grail of computer science. And, when I was young, Stanford Research had Shaky the Robot that was trying to pick things up. There were various logic systems that people were working on. You know so the dream was always some sort of reasoning capability. Overall progress in A.I., until machine learning came along, So was pretty modest. Even speech recognition was just barely reasonable. So we had that gigantic acceleration with machine learning particularly in sort of sensory things, recognizing speech, recognizing pictures. And it was phenomenal. And it just, you know kept getting better and scale was part of that. But we were still missing anything that had to do with complex logic. With being able to say read a text, and do what a human does, which is quote and understand what's in that text. And so as Microsoft was doing more with Open AI, I had a chance to go see them myself independently a number of times. They were doing a lot of text generation, they had a robot arm. The early text generation still didn't seem to have a broad understanding, you know like it could generate a sentence saying Joe's in Chicago, and then two sentences later say Joe's in Seattle which its local probabilistic sense was a good sentence but a human has a broad understanding of the world from both experience and reading. That you understand, that can't be. So they were enthusing about GPT-3 and even the early versions of GPT-4, I said to them, 'hey, if you can pass an advanced placement biology exam, where you take a question that's not part of the training set, or a bunch of them, and give fully reasoned answers knowing that biology textbook is one of many things that's in that training corps, then you will really get my attention because that would be a heck of a milestone. So, you know, please work on that.' I thought you know that would, they'd go away for two or three years. Because my intuition has always been we needed to understand knowledge representation and symbolic reasoning in a more explicit way. So that we were one or two inventions short of something where it was very good at reading and writing. And therefore being an assistant and so it was amazing that [they] over the summer were saying, yeah it might not be that long before we're going to come demo this thing to you because it's actually doing pretty well on scientific learning.So, with these details in mind, let's take a look at Bill Gates' top stock picks for 2023 out of which the biggest stakes are in Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI), Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

The delivered profit also exceeded analyst and the company’s own expectations, coming close to the record profit from the pre-pandemic 2018 that amounted to €1.45 billion. While the European airline industry hasn’t fully recovered, operating at about 95% pre-Covid capacity, Ryanair was operating at 125% of its pre-pandemic capacity, continuing on this growth trajectory.Ambitiously Reaching For The StarsWith its largest-ever summer schedule that covers nearly 2,500 routes with 3,000 daily flights, Ryanair expects to be flying 186 million passengers this year. Its long-term goal by 2034 is to transport 300 million passengers annually, which is more than any airline has done so far. Ryanair has spent $40 billion to purchase 300 new aircrafts from The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) as it continues pursuing its ambitious agenda.A Cautiously Optimistic OutlookCEO Michael O’Leary was cautiously optimistic while expecting profits to further increase, but moderately, this year and therefore, topping the 2018’s record with robust demand. Although summer demand is expected to be strong, soaring fuel costs need to be hedged effectively. Moreover, winter and the off-peak periods will be the ultimate test. Also, Boeing delivery delays could hamper 2024’s capacity.The Promise Of Its Multibillion-Dollar Deal With BoeingThe 300 ordered jets from Boeing are expected enable traffic to grow to 300 million passengers annually by March 2034. Ryanair will be adding 110 new Boeing jets over the next tree summer and therefore, open remarkable opportunities for the Irish airline. But Boeing’s delays in deliveries could potentially reduce first half passenger numbers by as many as 750,000 with the airline already expecting to be 10 jets short in June and July. O’Leary expects deliveries to go smoother next summer as aircrafts for the summer of 2024 should arrive by the end of next May.Story continuesThe Covid-19 Pandemic Made Travel ‘More Resistant’ To Inflation Despite inflation weakening consumer spending, it is crystal clear that European consumers are prioritizing travel over other types of entertainment.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

For more stocks, head on over to Billionaire Ken Griffin's 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. The stock market crash of 2022 hammered several major hedge funds. One of the biggest funds that bled capital last year is Chase Coleman and Feroze Dewan's Tiger Global. According to Insider Monkey's research, the hedge fund's portfolio as of the first quarter of 2023 was worth a respectable $10.9 billion. Sounds respectable right? After all, it's more money than most of us will likely ever see in our lifetimes (never say never?). Well, you won't think it's a lot of money when you consider the same hedge fund's portfolio by the end of 2022's first quarter. Back then, the portfolio was worth a whopping $26.6 billion, implying that in just a year, Tiger Global's portfolio has been cut by more than half.Another star that crashed last year was Catherine Wood's Ark Investment. Ark is known for obsessing over high growth technology companies, and these are precisely the ones that didn't see any love from the stock market last year. And the turbulence in these areas has also hammered Ark's portfolio. This portfolio, which was worth $23.9 billion by the end of Q1 2022 is currently worth $14.5 billion. Cumulatively speaking, data from LCH Investments - called the fund of funds - shows that the industry lost $208 billion last year and nearly one tenth of this was simply due to Tiger Global.However, not all funds were losers in 2022. The best performing hedge fund during the year was Ken Griffin's Citadel Investments. Citadel made $16 billion last year, nearly twice what the second best performing hedge fund D.E. Shaw Group made. So, undoubtedly, Citadel is the king of the hedge fund world right now. This strong performance made Citadel's founder and owner Mr. Ken Griffin not only one of the richest hedge fund managers in the world but also one of the richest people on the planet. Data from Forbes Magazine shows that Mr. Griffin's current net worth sits at a cool $32.3 billion - making him one of the fifty richest folks all around. Quite an achievement, we'd say, and one that becomes even more impressive when you consider the history of his fortunes. This is due to the fact that as recently as 2020, the billionaire's net worth stood at $12 billion. Looking at this, it would appear as if while the world is up in flames, Mr. Griffin knows how to hold his ground and do what he's best at doing i.e. making cold, hard cash.Story continuesThe billionaire is an alumnus of Harvard University, and he has been investing since his time at college. He set up Citadel just a year after graduating from university, and would soon go on to make high double digit returns. So naturally, his perspective on how to deal with losses and navigate through adversity is nothing less of a goldmine. Well, lucky for us, Mr. Griffin offered some gems during a fireside chat at the Yale School of Management in April 2023, where he shared:Well there's a little saying, a little quip that I like to make. History is written by the winners. Right. So the wonderful history of Citadel is how we're the most profitable hedge fund of all time. The chapter of how we were on the verge of going business in '08 is now like a footnote in that book. All right. That's a very important note. It is now all been an easy march to success. It's had, you know, I think have the interesting position in life I probably lost, my team has probably lost more money that perhaps any other firm in existence. We just happened to have made more money [LAUGHS] than almost any other firm in existence. And it's the net that everyone talks about. I mean there's years when our lost are. . are. . .hundreds of billions of dollars, I don't know if it's hundreds, it's over a hundred, maybe hundreds. It's numbers are incomprehensible, right. So, number is all my losses are my tuition, I have the most expensive education in American history. And a number of my colleagues have education that are becoming competitively - expensive.And I think it's very important, that like, we, in some sense you have have to have a moment of levity, okay? If every time you lost money, you got depressed and angry and you couldn't deal with it, you'd just have a very short career. you'd just have a very short career. So you need to be able to take a step back and go, 'it's a tuition bill I paid.' And it doesn't mean that you don't think very long and hard about what went wrong. But you have to keep it in perspective.In '08 that tuition bill almost became getting expelled from school. Because we were, we lost half of our equity in sixteen weeks, in a firm that had never had a double digit draw down in twenty years. The only reason we survived, and there's a number of reason, but the principle reason we survived is when long term capital failed 1998, I went and met with a number of senior people that worked at Long Term Capital. Why did I do this? What was my agenda? I wanted to understand how does a firm that loses 90% of its equity in a levered financial services industry, still stay in business? Like if you ask me that's one of the greatest accomplishments of all time, was that they lost 90% of their equity before they lost control of their business in a financial services, in a levered financial services company.

You're looking at losses of just about 30%. Now, the company reported weaker than expected . A full year profit guidance last week, but this might not be just a Foot Locker problem. Yahoo! Finance's Josh Schafer is here to explain who else could be at risk here. And maybe it's a sector wide issue when it comes to apparel-- athletic footwear.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Seana. So, I want to talk about Nike today. And really what you're looking at with Nike is there's sort of two things. There's their relationship to Foot Locker, and then there's the overall sector and what could be happening. But when we start with what's happening at Foot Locker, you take a look at Foot Locker sales have dropped over the last several quarters now-- or sorry not the last several quarters, but same store sales over the last several quarters have sort of been dwindling. Weak again this quarter.And what you're really looking at there is just a general slowdown. They're calling it a tough macroeconomic backdrop. But where that relates to Nike is Nike represents about 70% of Foot Locker's overall sales. So Foot Locker is seeing less sales. They're probably selling less Nike's, too. Wedbush pointing out in their note today that Nike actually accounted-- or Nike was a significant down draw, so what they saw was non-Nike sales increased.Wedbush then took that to mean that Nike probably-- Nike sales probably decreased in about the mid-teen range. And what's going to happen here is Foot Locker is saying that they still have too much inventory, right. Foot Locker still-- inventory is up 25% year-over-year. They want to offload that. Well, those are going to be Nike shoes that they're not going to buy then, right? Because they're still selling those shoes. And I think what people are worried about here is what that means for Nike overall and Nike's business. Are people just going to be buying less shoes as we see that consumer discretionary slowdown?Story continuesSEANA SMITH: What do you make of the inventory picture here this earnings season because we had seen for so many consecutive quarters that retailers across the board were really struggling with their inventory levels. Some of these retailers have been able to get it under control when you take into account what we heard from Target last week, Walmart, TJX. But when it comes to this side of the business, why do you think they're having a much tougher time? Do they not promote? Do they not have those types of markdowns that we were seeing maybe at some of the other retailers?JOSH SCHAFER: I think you have seen markdowns. And like you said, the big box retailers is a great story up on Yahoo! Finance right now on those-- and the inventory problems that they're not seeing, but what you're seeing with the retailer-- or with the athletic retailers is sales are just down, right. They were the biggest laggard in retail sales last month. People are not buying that second or third pair of shoes. And when you talk about a broader promotional environment, something that an analyst pointed out today with Nike-- other websites, like a StockX that sells Nike shoes on a secondary level, are now selling them cheaper than Nike sells them.Nike is now marking down shoes that are very popular. You talk about the Air Max 90s, Air Max 95s. Nike has sold those shoes for over $100 for years. Some of those now, you go on Nike's websites, there's a lot of shoes for under $100. So I think the environment is actually maybe over promotional in some ways, and then you become competitive against yourself if you're Nike when your shoes are out there on the secondary market for cheaper than you're trying to sell them on your website, it's hard to offload that.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Extremely challenging environment. I was actually shopping for Nike's this weekend and looking for those deals. So maybe more ahead. All right. Josh Schafer, thanks so much.]"

It highlighted declining same-store sales that could sink as much as 9% this year and “higher than average” inventories in the first quarter.Nike accounts for more than 70% of Foot Locker’s sales and is now seeing its stock drop on Foot Locker's print, with shares down nearly 3% on Monday.Foot Locker reported non-Nike penetration increasing to 35% in the first quarter, which equates to mid teens decreases for Nike sales, largely driven by weakness in lifestyle running, per Wedbush securities analyst Tom Nikic.But it's not just about the performance last quarter. On a call with investors on Friday, Foot Locker referenced clearing inventory and increasing promotions through the end of the year to eventually bring newness to its stores.With sporting goods recently having been the worst-performing segment in monthly retail sales, Foot Locker’s outlook has cast a shadow over demand in the sector. In a note titled “opening downside 90-day catalyst watch,” Citi analyst Paul Lejuez wrote a consumer slowdown and inventory overhang in the North American athletic apparel market reflects poorly on Nike’s fiscal-year expectations.“Given the seemingly high inventory levels in the channel (in footwear in particular) following a pullback in spending from lower-income consumers, we believe the margin setup may not be as favorable as previously thought,” Lejueze wrote.Story continuesNike shoes are seen displayed at a sporting goods store in New York City, New York, U.S., May 14, 2019. REUTERS/Mike Segar (Mike Segar / Reuters)What a ‘consumer spending slowdown’ means for NikeBeyond the inventory equation, analysts argue Nike also faces issues from a general overall slowdown in discretionary spending.“Athletic footwear brands have been speaking about excess inventory in the channel. Some have assumed the excess is from brands other than Nike,” UBS analyst Jay Sole wrote in a note to clients on Friday. “However, with FL's news on comps and shrink, the market is likely to conclude Nike is also feeling the effects of the soft good consumer spending slowdown which began in March.”Retail analyst Sam Poser at Williams Trading cut his rating on the stock from Neutral to Sell on Monday. Poser believes the issues go beyond inventories at wholesales and stem from a slowdown in direct-to-consumer demand for some of Nike’s traditionally popular shoes.The company, which built its digital brand around exclusive drops and the increased interest in sneaker culture now might be experiencing consumers that are “trained to look for promotions.” Poser suggests StockX and other secondary sellers are now selling Nike shoes below the manufacturer’s suggested price and in turn are becoming competitive to Nike’s own business.“Nike, both online and in its outlet stores is promoting many styles that are made for premium distribution at prices under $100 that are now competing with shoes sold in the family footwear channel,” Poser wrote. “Now, family footwear retailers are promoting their Nike styles, at least partially due to the pressure.”Nike is expected to provide its latest quarterly results on June 20.Josh is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

According to Bloomberg: “Icahn has been using money taken in from new investors to pay out dividends to old investors,” Hindenburg said in the report. “Such Ponzi-like economic structures are sustainable only to the extent that new money is willing to risk being the last one ‘holding the bag.’”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhile I do not include Icahn Enterprises in my list of three stocks that activist investors may need to swoop in and save, you could make the case based on Hindenburg’s report. Instead, I’ve sought out three other names that ought to be on activist investors’ to-do lists. NWLNewell Brands$8.89VFCVF Corporation$20.77TSNTyson Foods$49.97Newell Brands (NWL)A photo of a sign showing the Newell Brands (NWL) logo outside a building.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comOnce upon a time, long before Newell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) became a conglomeration of more than 100 consumer brands, it was a good company. In 1999, Newell Co. acquired Rubbermaid for $5.8 billion in stock after Rubbermaid’s long-time CEO, Stanley Gault, retired. The company went downhill quickly, so Newell pounced. Newell had spent three decades buying over 75 companies. Its game plan has always been to acquire a company, cut costs, raise margins and deliver shareholder value. In the case of Rubbermaid, Newell management said at the time that they would add $300 million to $350 million in operating income by 2000 due to the buyout. In 1997, Newell had operating income of $572 million. By 2000, it had an operating income of $832 million — up $260 million but not quite hitting the mark — on $6.9 billion in revenue. Two decades later, Newell Brands’ 2022 operating income was $312 million, less than half its 2000 figure, on $9.5 billion in revenue. So, while revenue is 38% higher than in 2000, the company is far less profitable. Story continuesIronically, Icahn brokered a deal in April to end a proxy battle with hedge fund Starboard Value. Some other activists ought to pick up the torch. Down 66% in the past five years, Newell could just be the worst stock in the S&amp;P 500.VF Corporation (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comVF Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is an apparel conglomerate with well-known brands such as Vans, Timberland, The North Face, Supreme and Dickies. The company has faced little activism over the years. However, it did take some heat in 2018 when it banned a shareholder from the annual meeting. Other than that, it’s been pretty quiet. However, VF’s stock is in a freefall. Down 25% year to date, 57% over the past year and 72% over the past five years, a $10,000 investment in May 2018 would be worth just $2,800 today. In early May, VFC stock got a bit of a boost when Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow upgraded it from “sell” to “hold,” suggesting that the problems that plagued it were in the rearview mirror. Boruchow also said that its Vans sneaker brand, which until 2022 had been the company’s strongest performer, was on the mend. And he suggested the company’s dividend cut will likely help it fund future growth. That’s all well and good, but when a stock has performed as poorly as VFC, something must be done before shareholders see all of its value evaporate. Perhaps activist investors are the answer.Tyson Foods (TSN)A package of Tyson Foods (TSN) chicken breasts.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comHow is it that Tyson Foods (NYSE: TSN) Chief Financial Officer (CFO) John R. Tyson still has a job while 10% of the company’s corporate staff will lose theirs? Tyson was arrested in November for entering a stranger’s house while intoxicated and sleeping half-naked in one of the bedrooms. Apparently, getting drunk and sleeping it off in the wrong house isn’t cause for dismissal, but being the poor sap whose name is selected out of a hat as part of a job reduction plan is.Tyson is the largest processor of chicken and beef in the U.S. Its brands include Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farms, Ball Park and Sara Lee. The company reported an operating loss in the second quarter of $49 million, down from a $1.16 billion operating profit a year ago. Meanwhile, shares are down nearly 20% YTD, 46% over the past year and more than 26% over the past five years. Like the other two names on my list, you would think activist investors would have a field day with Tyson. It’s got some well-known brands and a key position in America’s food chain, yet it continues to sputter. Unfortunately, the Tyson family has a 20% economic interest in the company and controls 71% of the votes. However, just because you can’t take down the Tysons doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try.        On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Shares closed more than 4% higher yesterday.While still expecting that KeyCorp’s fundamentals will be weak this year and that a recovery in earnings will not occur until 2024, the firm believes that investors buying this stock at current prices are likely to be well rewarded, highlighting the dividend yield of 8.35%, and the stock valued at 77.7% of book value. Furthermore, the firm noted that unlike many of its peers, this bank did not shift its available-for-sale portfolio (AFS) to held to maturity (HTM), so its book value is credible. Moreover, 66% of its deposits are insured or collateralized.2 more upgradesKeefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods upgraded Greenhill (NYSE:GHL) to Market Perform from Underperform after Mizuho Financial, the 15th largest bank in the world as measured by total assets of ~$2 trillion, announced it will acquire the company in an all-cash transaction at $15 per share, reflecting an enterprise value of around $550 million, including assumed debt.Story continuesGreenhill shares jumped more than 116% yesterday. Myriad Genetics (NASDAQ:MYGN) shares gained more than 3% pre-market today after Goldman Sachs upgraded the company to Buy from Sell and raised its price target to $25.00 from $18.00.Given the persistent multiple discount vs peers, the firm believes Myriad’s resetting its organic growth rate, restructuring and improving its commercial efforts and trimming the portfolio is not reflected in the share price.Jump on the biggest news for your portfolio amid a barrage of market headlines: Always be the first to know with InvestingPro.Start your free 7-day trial now.Related Articles4 big analyst picks: Battered regional banks becoming buysAuto parts retailer AutoZone misses Q3 sales estimates on inventory pile-upBJ's slips after missing Q1 revenue estimates; Goldman sees positives]"

We have Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo here more on this clinical trial. And the results here providing a big pop for Pfizer stock today.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And we know that these weight loss medications and treatments are all the rage. So as you mentioned, this full peer-reviewed study of the clinical trial of Pfizer's danuglipron, that treatment is out showing that the potential for a faster path to weight loss than the current treatments using diabetes drugs to treat obesity. Now, Pfizer stock rising as participants were able to lose about 10 pounds over the course of 16 weeks versus 9.9 pounds over the course of 30 weeks with Novo Nordisk's current treatment Ozempic a.k.a. Wegovy. Of course, a lot of people know that was used by Elon Musk, but know the different dosage levels as well. Another key difference is that danuglipron is an oral pill versus weekly injections with Ozempic because, obviously, that's something that can be off-putting for people.Now, the phase II trial of danuglipron followed 411 adults with type 2 diabetes who either took the drug twice a day or a placebo. Now, both of these treatments, danuglipron and Ozempic, they mimic the GLP-1 hormone in the gut. That's that hormone that tells us when the brain-- the brain is telling us that we're full. Side effects, though, also related to the gut, mostly nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and headaches.But it's worth noting that this is a bigger, randomized, controlled trial than was used in phase I. That followed 37 patients. And that also means that these trial participants are randomly selected to receive the treatment or the placebo, which also helps introduce less bias as well.Story continuesAnd, of course, we have to mention Eli Lilly, already in this space at the moment with an injectable called Mounjaro. They're seeking FDA approval potentially, some reports saying, might come by the end of this year or potentially beginning of next year. But a reminder, of course, the obesity reduction aspect, this is off label use. These are diabetes drugs. And Wegovy is the only FDA approved treatment out of these so far for chronic weight management.Now, of course, this isn't just supposed to be some sort of magic pill or magic shot here. This is supposed to be used with a reduced calorie meal plan as well as increased physical activity. So worth keeping that in mind. There are no shortcuts when it comes to overall health, guys.SEANA SMITH: Certainly not, but we're seeing investors excited about this with shares popping today up just about 5%. Rachelle, thanks.]"

Since its creation in 2021, the IBM Education Security Preparedness Grants program has expanded globally, and this year will also include enhanced offerings from IBM SkillsBuild on topics including AI and cybersecurity.Ransomware is unfolding faster than ever, with attackers managing to cut down the time required to deploy ransomware attacks from over two months to just under four days between 2019 and 2021, according to IBM's X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2023. In fact, the share of cybersecurity incidents observed in the education sector more than doubled in 2022 compared to the year prior, experiencing the largest increase year over year than any other industry.""Time and time again attackers go after the education sector, yet many of these institutions remain constrained in their security resources,"" said Andy Piazza, Global Head of Threat Intelligence, IBM Security X-Force. ""To date, this program has helped more than 350,000 students across schools in the US and abroad, with IBM Service Corps helping them recover from ransomware attacks, strengthen their security posture against future attacks, and prevent further disruption.""Applications for schools are now open globally. Grants valued at $500,000 each ($5 million in total) will be awarded to six school districts in the US with an additional four around the world. Volunteers, through IBM Service Corps, will use their professional skills to help schools establish programs to address cybersecurity resiliency. Each selected school will receive:Story continuesincident response plans and ransomware playbooks,programs to help address the need for updating operating systems,strategic communication plans to use in response to cyber incidents, andtraining and digital credentials through IBM SkillsBuild on topics including AI and cybersecurity, and additional benefits such as enhanced access to IBM mentors, teacher training and toolkits, and customized learning pathways.""The global skills gap across cybersecurity and AI is a growing challenge that demands immediate attention,"" said Justina Nixon-Saintil, IBM Chief Impact Officer. ""To address this challenge, IBM awards Education Security Preparedness Grants to drive impact with schools worldwide. This year, we're excited to expand the program to bring the benefits of IBM SkillsBuild training on topics like AI and cybersecurity for students and teachers.""Since its inception in 2021, IBM has received hundreds of applications for this award-winning program from school districts seeking to strengthen their security postures in response to the growing threats in the education space. Past recipients of the IBM Education Security Preparedness Grants, a list of which can be found here, have encouraged other schools to apply.""With IBM's assistance, we improved our cybersecurity incident response plan and used it to better prepare us for handling incidents in the future,"" said Robert Losinski, Manager of Information Security at Denver Public Schools. ""Attackers are targeting schools because many do not have mature security frameworks to effectively defend against ransomware and other cybercrime. Getting professional assistance in expanding your cybersecurity program will really help you identify the most critical areas to protect.""K-12 public schools and educational institutions/organizations that are interested in applying for IBM's education cybersecurity grant can apply via IBM.com here: https://www.ibm.com/impact/initiatives/security.

This app, originally created by Deltares, is free for users and can help farmers improve water quality, protect biodiversity, save on fertilizer costs and make farming practices more sustainable.Deltares joined the IBM Sustainability Accelerator to implement a new user interface designed to make the app more accessible for farmers, add more value to the user, and increase adoption. After completing the first phase with the IBM Garage, a new version of the app will become available in the next few months with enhanced user experience, measurement recording and information sharing capabilities.This solution is being developed to support farmers with the intention of using IBM technology, such as artificial intelligence, to provide an easy and accessible platform to engage with other farmers and to share water quality knowledge with communities.The global Aquality app user community currently consists of over 600 active users and thousands of direct beneficiaries, in particular in the Netherlands. For example, measurements from the App inform environmental monitoring and management efforts in the provinces of Limburg and Zeeland. Further, the App is now being piloted by users in Denmark, France, South Africa and the United States, which provides an opportunity to continue testing the app with more farmers to increase awareness and address a greater variety of needs.To help protect our environment and aid farmers around the world, utilizing sustainable agriculture systems is critical.

""Our expansion in Denver will further enable us to connect our customers to destinations across the globe and revitalize our presence at the airport with modern, customer friendly offerings.""According to The American Growth Project, Denver is one of America's fastest growing cities. It not only attracts professionals who work in hybrid environments, but also has retained millennials who lived in Denver when they were younger and decided to stay or return by age 26. Both of those groups want access to more flexible travel options that include a wide range of domestic and international choices.Story continuesThe airline will add new non-stops to six destinations including four not served by any other Denver airline: Dayton, OH; Greensboro, NC; Lexington, KY and San Juan, Puerto Rico.The airline's local infrastructure improvements include 12 new gates set to open in the A and B concourses by the middle of 2024. That will give United 90 total gates, the most at Denver International Airport.This expansion is part of the carrier's nearly $1 billion investment to further improve the customer experience in Denver – an increase in gate capacity by 30%, a new check-in lobby, new user-friendly technology at gates, a new grab-n-go club concept called United Club FlySM and the renovation and expansion of United ClubSM locations.This summer, United will also open a new club on the A Concourse and reopen its first of two revamped clubs on the B Concourse. The B concourse United Club locations will be the largest ever . All three United Club locations will feature two full levels of club space, and an upgraded design that reflects the Colorado region.To commemorate United's long-term commitment to the city of Denver, Mayor Michael B. Hancock has issued a proclamation naming today 'United Airlines Day.' United's presence in Denver is significant to the prosperity of the city, and today's declaration by the Mayor reiterates United as Denver's hometown airline.""It's been an honor to work with United during my time as Mayor of Denver. Together, we've been able to extend our city's reach across the world,"" said Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock. ""United's domestic and global network supports DEN's Vision 100 strategic plan to expand for 100 million passengers within the next decade, and I'm proud to see them continue to grow their network at DEN and further connect our community to more destinations.""Growing United's Network in DenverAs a result of the airline's United Next plan, United will expand mainline flying out of Denver to its highest levels in 20 years, while repurposing its regional fleet to fly to smaller, less-served destinations. Overall, United will offer more capacity from Denver than ever before, with over 60,000 departing seats per day.In total, United will operate 35 new flights in 2023 out of Denver and since 2018, has added over 90 mainline departures per day.This year, United will fly new 737 MAX aircraft non-stop to San Juan, Puerto Rico, beginning October 29, and Montego Bay, Jamaica*, beginning November 4. In addition to the new routes, United will use its new MAX aircraft to increase service to popular destinations like Miami, Austin, Boston and Atlanta. As United grows its mainline fleet, the airline will use Embraer 175 aircraft to connect Denver with Asheville, NC; Dayton, OH; Greensboro, NC and Lexington, KY, starting on September 29.United's new morning flight bank will offer Denver customers expanded flight options to many popular destinations like Dallas/Fort Worth, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Orlando, Phoenix, Portland, San Diego and Seattle. By doubling the total number of early morning departures and late evening arrivals, customers will have more flexibility and a greater ability to maximize their stays.This summer, United will fly non-stop to more than 150 destinations from Denver, with over 450 daily departures – more than 50% more flights and destinations than the airline's nearest competitor. United is proud to be the only airline serving Hawaii non-stop from Denver, with up to five daily flights across Hawaii's four largest islands. Additionally, with 18 international destinations – more than double any other airline, and the only US carrier serving Europe and Japan – United is the go-to airline for Denver customers traveling across the United States and the world.New Gates and ClubsLast year, United began its ambitious concourse expansion, adding 20 new gates across A and B concourses. United plans to open 12 more gates by the middle of 2024, bringing United to an industry-leading 90 gates at the airport. The airline is also investing more than $40 million to update its footprint at 55 existing Concourse B gates by incorporating modern furniture options with in-seat power and new digital signage and self-service kiosks to support customers on their journey.This summer, United will also open two of three new United Club locations in Denver, including its largest club in the world.

Elsewhere, investors will be watching the release of fresh data on activity in the American service and manufacturing sectors, while Lowe's prepares to unveil its latest results as the quarterly corporate earnings season begins to ebb.1. 'Productive, not progress'The scramble in Washington to reach a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling has intensified after a crucial meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy failed to produce an agreement.Biden said the discussions on Monday were ""productive,"" but McCarthy said ""no progress"" was made in breaking the impasse. Both sides remain at odds over spending plans, although Biden and McCarthy were optimistic that they will eventually find a path toward lifting the $31.4 trillion borrowing limit.However, McCarthy has flagged that a deal needs to be hashed out this week in order to give Congress time to vote on it before the U.S. crashes into a damaging and unprecedented default.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has reiterated that the federal government could run out of money to pay its bills as soon as June 1. Investors are nervous that this could create ripple effects through global markets.2. Futures volatile amid debt limit talksU.S. stock futures were mixed in choppy trading on Tuesday as investors digested comments from Democrats and Republicans on the debt limit negotiations.At 04:54 ET (08:54 GMT), the Dow futures contract moved down 44 points or 0.13%, S&amp;P 500 futures lost 3 points or 0.07%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 1 point or 0.01%.The main indices ended the trading day on Monday muted, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipping by 0.42% and the benchmark S&amp;P 500 inching only 0.02% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also gained 0.50%.3. U.S. PMI data aheadTraders today will also be keeping an eye on the release of the monthly U.S. purchasing managers' index, which is expected to provide insight into how elevated interest rates are impacting the performance of the country's service and manufacturing sectors.Story continuesThe preliminary PMI reading is projected to show that activity in both industries slowed in May, although the figure for services - a major portion of the world's largest economy - is projected to remain in expansion territory.Meanwhile, the PMI number for manufacturing is seen touching the 50-mark exactly, a level that denotes neither growth nor contraction.Elsewhere on the economic calendar, data for new home sales is also due out, with economists estimating that the amount of new single-family properties sold in April dipped compared to the prior month.4. Lowe's on deck as first-quarter earnings season winds downHome improvement chain Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) is set to release its first-quarter results before the start of U.S. trading on Tuesday, headlining a waning stream of U.S. corporate earnings.Lowe's latest returns are expected to shed more light on the health of the U.S. consumer following a string of numbers from other brand-name retailers last week.Rival Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and big-box group Target (NYSE:TGT) were both hit by cost-of-living pressures that convinced more shoppers to rein in spending on high-priced discretionary items. Home Depot saw three-month sales drop 4.2%, while quarterly comparable sales at Target were flat.However, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) posted a stronger-than-anticipated revenue bump and raised its financial outlook. The megachain known for its low-cost offerings was buoyed by solid demand for groceries, a sign that demand is shifting to essential items as inflation eats into customers' wallets.Other retailers reporting on Tuesday include sports equipment seller Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) and kitchenware business Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM).5. Crude prices slip into the redOil prices moved slightly lower on Tuesday, paring back earlier gains, with the ongoing uncertainty around the debt ceiling talks denting risk sentiment even as the start of the U.S. driving season edges closer.At 04:22 ET, U.S. crude futures inched down by 0.12% at $71.96 per barrel, while the Brent contract slipped by 0.10% to $75.89 a barrel.U.S. fuel consumption is set to pick up with the start of the summer season, which is usually marked by the upcoming Memorial Day weekend at the end of May. This, coupled with disruptions in Canadian supply due to wildfires in the oil-rich Alberta province, has suggested that oil markets may be tighter in the coming months.Related ArticlesDebt ceiling meeting, U.S. PMIs, Lowe's reports - what's moving marketsGreece on track for new vote with leftists unable to form coalitionIMF says UK is no longer heading for a recession in 2023]"

Deb, good to see you. Thanks for being here. Can you hear us OK?DEBORAH WEINSWIG: Perfect.JULIE HYMAN: OK. Excellent. So talk to us about-- are we going to continue to see this sort of differentiation from between staples and discretionary, and how is that going to play out in the companies that we've yet to hear from?DEBORAH WEINSWIG: Well, I think not only are we seeing a difference between the staples retailers and discretionary retailers. We're also seeing a difference between the higher end and let's say the kind of opening price point, right, with Tapestry a few weeks ago talking about how they're seeing, kind of, no price resistances. They're raising prices, yet we are definitely seeing, I would say, a bit of a trade down as Walmart referred to it.So I think it definitely depends kind of what sector you're in. And if we look at like a TJ Ross Burlington, kind of, that off price, there's certainly a lot of interest from the consumer there, foot traffic, and also conversion.BRAD SMITH: OK. And so-- I mean, we've already seen-- in terms of some of the retail sales data that's come through as well, Deb-- that it's not looking great for some of the more specialty retailers, especially considering sporting goods hobby musical instruments bookstores month-over-month they declined by about 3.3%. So what does that set up mean-- even in terms of the month over month from March to April-- how could that translate into their own earnings results that they saw, too?DEBORAH WEINSWIG: Yeah. I think specialty is definitely facing some challenges. I do think that if we look at some of these alternative revenue streams-- I believe in March of 23 that Gap backed away from retail media and advertising services-- and so this has been another kind of revenue stream for the likes of Walmart, Target, Macy's, Kroger-- Amazon I think led the way, but these multi-brand retailers, I believe, are much better positioned because they are finding other revenue streams outside of traditional retail.Story continuesSo whether it's data monetization, whether it's retail media, whether it's selling their IP, it's one of the reasons we've been so constructive on multi-brand retail. But it's a very, very important point that we would be in the, let's say, kind of outside of the masstige stage to luxury price range-- like a Tapestry-- is why we would be more concerned around the specialty retail retailers right now.JULIE HYMAN: I'm curious about department stores as well. I mean, we've been talking a little bit about Macy's, and it's what-- 28% slump or something this year, and how they're going to fare in this environment when people are really, sort of, battening down the hatches.DEBORAH WEINSWIG: I mean, I think that Macy's does deliver overall great value and ultimately ends up being almost the same price as you would pay at a TJ Ross Burlington, but it's, kind of, a coupon on top of deal on top of-- right. It can-- there's a lack of transparency sometimes to the consumer. And so I do think that there continues to be an opportunity for them on the marketing side and also kind of how they communicate to their customers and a loyalty program, et cetera.So I do think that they are challenged from that perspective. And also with some of the-- I think we have to say it, right-- the organized retail crime that Target talked about last week. There are some retailers who are definitely having more of a challenge with that than others.BRAD SMITH: When we hear about mix shifts from some of the largest retailers in the US like target, like Walmart, how might those mix shifts show up in the earnings results that are still set to come forward this week, knowing that those mixed shifts have actually meant consumers are perhaps just leaning more into the necessities that they need to purchase from those other retailers?DEBORAH WEINSWIG: I think you're definitely continuing to see this kind of movement into more necessity. Some of the, kind of, government support was pulled back in the last quarter. I think we're starting to see that show up. And I think that the consumers, while we're not necessarily as it was-- as you said earlier-- we're not seeing like a slowdown. I think everyone's just a bit more tepid.So-- and we also have-- we look at goods and services, right. The consumer is also kind of redirecting some of their discretionary spend towards services. And I think that in that environment that you either have to have, kind of, a really strong brand like a Tapestry, and the consumer is kind of trading up in some cases. But I think that when it comes to the necessities, that the consumer is watching what they spend. So this frugality almost, right. They are treating themselves, right, to a trip, to a vacation, to whatnot. But when it comes to day to day spending-- this is, I think, the key-- they are definitely, kind of, counting their pennies and being a bit more careful.And where there are strong loyalty programs, where there's personalization, where there's customization, there are ways that we're seeing some of these retailers win. And some of the names, right-- Target, Walmart, Kroger-- they're really-- I mean they have, kind of, in the show earlier, right-- they have a lot of data on their consumer, right. They're just bigger retailers. I think they're able to do a much better job of delivering that customized experience, which I think is starting to show up in a bigger way in market share gains, but also gains in terms of where the consumer is spending their time, their money and their mindshare.JULIE HYMAN: And then another story, another thread in all of the retail earnings is inventories, which now seem to be getting more right sized, right. This is something our Seana Smith wrote about. It's on the Yahoo Finance platform. How does that position the retailers for the second half of the year with now inventories being more lean? Is that a good thing? Does it mean that they'll be able to weather things a little bit better?DEBORAH WEINSWIG: I mean, to me, holiday 21 was on record the most profitable holiday season we've ever seen because inventories were so light. You know, retailers felt that they missed out on sales, so they went the other direction for holiday 22. We're still working down unbelievably some of that inventory, and there still is inventory, kind of, that they haven't taken on to their books yet that is sitting in factories, warehouses, 3PL centers, so I do want to just be somewhat cautious.We are definitely in a much better position than we were for holiday 22. The stores will be more pleasant to shop. We won't see that very aggressive, kind of, I would say markdown cadence, so it won't be this rush to the bottom I think. We are seeing pricing power. I actually think that is one of the most important things. As we talked today, [INAUDIBLE] earnings season so far.And I think the positive is, for two age, that we will see much cleaner inventory levels, which will be just a better experience, but also we won't see all this aggressive discounting that we saw last year. So I do think it's a positive I just do want to be cautious that there are still higher inventory levels. It's just not on the retailer's books just yet.BRAD SMITH: To what extent does credit card spending right now in data that's been amassed even by the New York Fed signal that this is a consumer that's very much bracing for-- and perhaps some of them already experiencing-- the early moments of a recession.DEBORAH WEINSWIG: You know, it's interesting. Kind of coming out of March 10, SVD, many of us in the kind of retail consumer space were concerned about the consumer. And every additional data point I would say does make one a bit more cautious, but we continue to see spending, honestly, at a level higher than I would have expected in May of 23. But I would say from a debt perspective, from a, sort of, where we're seeing the consumer pull back-- I mean, there are definitely signs that they are more cautious, and that they're debt-- personal consumer debt-- is building.I would just say I think that we all need to of keep our eye in terms of one or more caution, but that don't count this consumer out yet. They really have, I think, exceeded all expectations to date. And it does seem that while we all continue to, kind of, debate recession over cession, this consumer has definitely continue to spend on goods and services at a higher level than many of us would have expected. And, you know, I'm not counting them out just yet.JULIE HYMAN: Truth. Deborah Weinswig, thanks so much. Our Coresight Research CEO. Thanks so much.]"

The retail earnings roundup continues this week following last week's mixed picture with Costco, Lowe's, and Best Buy all on tap for this week. So what should investors expect? Yahoo Finance's Josh Shafer joins us now. Josh, what are we watching for?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Brad, so I want to start by just going over what we saw last week and what we can learn from that and maybe sort of look for going into this week. And I think the biggest story out of last week was are not seeing a slowdown yet. People are talking about a slowdown, but when you look at those same-store sales numbers from some of the big companies that reported last week, these are not down from last year.You see Target up nearly 1% when you're talking about brick-and-mortar stores. Walmart was up over 7%. TJX up about 3%. So we had talked a lot even last week in anticipation of these earnings, basically saying, is the slowdown already happening? It is not already happening. So we're curious about what we hear moving forward and specifically when we think about what we heard from Walmart what we hear from a trade-down perspective.I think that's going to be some of the interesting companies to watch this week when you think about a BJ's is reporting, Dollar Tree, Costco. Are they saying that they think higher-income consumers are trading down because that is something that we heard from Walmart last week?- Yeah, definitely. And also, the companies that are more weighted towards grocery seem to be better. The ones that are more discretionary-based are not doing as well. Foot Locker is really a prime example. Got killed on Friday, and then there's some analysts chatter continuing this morning that's not very positive.JOSH SCHAFER: And you're curious, what does that mean for Dick's Sporting Goods. How different is the business? And I think the business, from at least what analysts expect going into Dick's report is it is a very different business. When you think about what Dick's has already been able to build out from a private brand perspective when you think about what Dick's has been able to do as far as getting rid of inventory being in a wholesale spot.Story continuesI think Foot Locker is an interesting company to think about when we talk about a consumer slowdown because Foot Locker is trying to rebrand right now. They were already in the process of trying to change what they're doing. You do that, well, you already have uncertainty in the overall economy.It's going to be tough to try and rebuild same-store sales growth when you're not even sure if people that have been coming into stores are going to be coming into stores. And I think that's what puts Foot Locker in kind of a unique struggling position here.- Yeah, well, we'll see how the stock continues to doing Dick's to your point. A lot of suspense there. Going to be interesting. Thanks, Josh. Appreciate it.]"

The bank reiterating a neutral rating on Nike shares with a price target of $125. The analysts citing concerns over inventory and footwear retailers on lower consumer spending could push Nike to issue gross margin forward guidance below Wall Street estimates. Let's have a broader conversation on retail with Steve Sosnick and Brian Sozzi-- also joining us here on the desk, now. Yahoo Finance's own executive editor.All right. So Brian, I'll bring you into the chat here first. We've got some of these specialty retailers that are going to be reporting over the course of this week. We already heard Foot Locker, and now Nike getting this call on the street as well here on the day. I mean, what is this signaling about where some of the guidance expectations still perhaps need to be lowered a little bit.BRIAN SOZZI: Let me tell you why downgraded Citigroup this morning. No. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. It's really what you should be doing as an investor-- tying all the pieces together. So when Foot Locker came out on Friday, the stock was absolutely slaughtered. You know, Steve. Down 27%. Still seeing weakness this morning here. That is Foot Locker saying, we didn't deliver. We were surprised by how the consumer responded to what was in the store.What was in these stores? Still inflationary goods. Not just in sneakers. Apparel, socks, you name it. And the consumer continued to show-- at least with the first batch of retail earnings reports. Walmart, Target, you name it-- they are not going to go out and spend too much or outside of their budgets to buy inflationary goods they view as discretionary. And in some cases, a lot of those styles from Nike, Under Armor, you name it, those are discretionary purchases that you just do not need right now.Story continuesSTEVE SOSNICK: But the question I have for you Brian is so many consumer goods companies did well on their first quarter earnings because they said they were able to pass along higher costs. I'm going to say Chipotle being the big winner, but McDonald's, Kimberly-Clark, Pepsi, et cetera et cetera. But their quarter ended March 31, and now we're hearing from companies whose quarters ended April 30. And we also heard those [? U Mich ?] numbers, which were-- they stunk. Did we fall off a cliff in April? Is that possible?BRIAN SOZZI: Well, I think Chipotle just sells better stuff maybe than a Foot Locker Nike. I mean, why not pay more for Chipotle? But we have seen consumers--JULIE HYMAN: Well, but you need to eat.BRIAN SOZZI: --pay more for experience. You need to eat, and that is not discretionary. And I think consumers have shown a willingness-- at least for the first part of this year-- to pay more for experiences. And going to a Chipotle, getting a very overstuffed burrito or a salad bowl is an experience. And to your point, Julie, yes, you do in fact need to eat.Kimberly-Clark-- I would actually argue they didn't necessarily have a good quarter. You've seen a lot of consumers in this environment trade down to private label goods, and that is one thing Walmart called out in their earnings release that I think everybody should be digging more into are those names like a P&amp;G and Kimberly-Clark losing further market share in this environment as stretch households trade down to private label goods. That's a big problem.But if there's any saving grace, I point to a story right now on our home page by our very own Seana Smith, retail inventories. They have come way down. So if the consumer rebounds in the back half of this year-- maybe for back to school, and aiming for the holiday shopping season-- these retail stocks can start working higher again because retailers have worked down these inventories, margins could be in a better shape, earnings could reaccelerate, and those stocks go higher.BRAD SMITH: Well, it's also the question of will it take some of the FOMO from the consumer to also come back and say, ""All right, if I see a shoe that's in Foot Locker, am I concerned that they're not going to have that shoe if I go back when I'm actually ready to purchase it?"" Because the intent to purchase in the time to purchase as well being taken into account with the consumer right now and how they're looking across-- OK. The FOMO that I used to have about missing out on something versus-- I just can't do that right now because it just doesn't make sense. If you speak even into the secondary market or the resale economy as well, a lot of those resellers are saying, I'm not even going out and purchasing this because I'm afraid that I'm not going to be able to find a buyer out there, too.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, the new normal for sneaker-- and you're a sneaker guy, Brad-- is now-- it used to be what? 100, 110? Now it's 150.BRAD SMITH: Upwards of 200.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, and I am very curious when Dick's Sporting Goods reports this week how they did in their footwear department because you go into a Dick's Sporting Goods, these sneakers are extremely, extremely expensive. What, two pairs-- I mean, I have no kids-- but if two pairs of sneakers for kids-- what you're looking at what? $253, $300 maybe, depending on what you buy. It's a huge purchase.JULIE HYMAN: I would say maybe what happened more was that some of those early results masked rather-- I mean, I don't know that anything dramatic changed in April, but at the same time, it's difficult to see like some of these retailers have been saying the second half is going to be better. When you talk about back to school, and-- it's tough to see there being a big improvement. I don't know. What do you-- I mean excess savings is getting worked down. What do you think?STEVE SOSNICK: I do think-- You know we were talking about headwinds before, and these will affect consumers if these headwinds filter through the economy. One thing that I-- you know, one of the lessons that I learned early on in my career is it's very hard to sustain a broad market rally if retail is not participating. And I mean retail stocks as opposed to retail investors. That too, but if retail stocks are not participating, it's not a great sign for the broader economy because the consumer is still--BRIAN SOZZI: But do you want to see Walmart shares outperform? They, in fact, have. I would argue-- I want to see Macy's stocks starting to work again. That has been an abysmal trade this year. To see Walmart shares outperforming, I would argue that is not a good economic signal.STEVE SOSNICK: That's exactly it Walmart. Walmart is where people trade down to. That was one of the things to look for last week was are people trading down from Target to Walmart because one is perceived to be higher than the other. And it does seem to be happening. I think people are pulling back, and so in a certain extent, Walmart becomes the winner, but it's because people-- do agree that it's because people are sort of feeling crappy?BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah. It's expensive. I mean, you saw Target and Walmart not-- calling out people are not shopping those discretionary areas-- home goods, et cetera. But look I saw the new QR code on our site right now. I encourage everybody. Download the app, scan your phone over, and get at it. Comment at us.JULIE HYMAN: And guess what?BRIAN SOZZI: I want to know.JULIE HYMAN: And guess what? It's free.BRIAN SOZZI: It's free. It's great. I want to know what are you-- who's shopping at Target or Walmart? What are you buying? Get at us. I mean, that's why we have that stuff up there.BRAD SMITH: Brian Sozzi joining us here today.

For more stocks, head on over to Billionaire Ken Griffin's 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. The stock market crash of 2022 hammered several major hedge funds. One of the biggest funds that bled capital last year is Chase Coleman and Feroze Dewan's Tiger Global. According to Insider Monkey's research, the hedge fund's portfolio as of the first quarter of 2023 was worth a respectable $10.9 billion. Sounds respectable right? After all, it's more money than most of us will likely ever see in our lifetimes (never say never?). Well, you won't think it's a lot of money when you consider the same hedge fund's portfolio by the end of 2022's first quarter. Back then, the portfolio was worth a whopping $26.6 billion, implying that in just a year, Tiger Global's portfolio has been cut by more than half.Another star that crashed last year was Catherine Wood's Ark Investment. Ark is known for obsessing over high growth technology companies, and these are precisely the ones that didn't see any love from the stock market last year. And the turbulence in these areas has also hammered Ark's portfolio. This portfolio, which was worth $23.9 billion by the end of Q1 2022 is currently worth $14.5 billion. Cumulatively speaking, data from LCH Investments - called the fund of funds - shows that the industry lost $208 billion last year and nearly one tenth of this was simply due to Tiger Global.However, not all funds were losers in 2022. The best performing hedge fund during the year was Ken Griffin's Citadel Investments. Citadel made $16 billion last year, nearly twice what the second best performing hedge fund D.E. Shaw Group made. So, undoubtedly, Citadel is the king of the hedge fund world right now. This strong performance made Citadel's founder and owner Mr. Ken Griffin not only one of the richest hedge fund managers in the world but also one of the richest people on the planet. Data from Forbes Magazine shows that Mr. Griffin's current net worth sits at a cool $32.3 billion - making him one of the fifty richest folks all around. Quite an achievement, we'd say, and one that becomes even more impressive when you consider the history of his fortunes. This is due to the fact that as recently as 2020, the billionaire's net worth stood at $12 billion. Looking at this, it would appear as if while the world is up in flames, Mr. Griffin knows how to hold his ground and do what he's best at doing i.e. making cold, hard cash.Story continuesThe billionaire is an alumnus of Harvard University, and he has been investing since his time at college. He set up Citadel just a year after graduating from university, and would soon go on to make high double digit returns. So naturally, his perspective on how to deal with losses and navigate through adversity is nothing less of a goldmine. Well, lucky for us, Mr. Griffin offered some gems during a fireside chat at the Yale School of Management in April 2023, where he shared:Well there's a little saying, a little quip that I like to make. History is written by the winners. Right. So the wonderful history of Citadel is how we're the most profitable hedge fund of all time. The chapter of how we were on the verge of going business in '08 is now like a footnote in that book. All right. That's a very important note. It is now all been an easy march to success. It's had, you know, I think have the interesting position in life I probably lost, my team has probably lost more money that perhaps any other firm in existence. We just happened to have made more money [LAUGHS] than almost any other firm in existence. And it's the net that everyone talks about. I mean there's years when our lost are. . are. . .hundreds of billions of dollars, I don't know if it's hundreds, it's over a hundred, maybe hundreds. It's numbers are incomprehensible, right. So, number is all my losses are my tuition, I have the most expensive education in American history. And a number of my colleagues have education that are becoming competitively - expensive.And I think it's very important, that like, we, in some sense you have have to have a moment of levity, okay? If every time you lost money, you got depressed and angry and you couldn't deal with it, you'd just have a very short career. you'd just have a very short career. So you need to be able to take a step back and go, 'it's a tuition bill I paid.' And it doesn't mean that you don't think very long and hard about what went wrong. But you have to keep it in perspective.In '08 that tuition bill almost became getting expelled from school. Because we were, we lost half of our equity in sixteen weeks, in a firm that had never had a double digit draw down in twenty years. The only reason we survived, and there's a number of reason, but the principle reason we survived is when long term capital failed 1998, I went and met with a number of senior people that worked at Long Term Capital. Why did I do this? What was my agenda? I wanted to understand how does a firm that loses 90% of its equity in a levered financial services industry, still stay in business? Like if you ask me that's one of the greatest accomplishments of all time, was that they lost 90% of their equity before they lost control of their business in a financial services, in a levered financial services company. And much of what we learned from how they survived that was actually fundamentally existentially important to our ability to withstand the turmoil of 2008. So there's a very important lesson here, which is not only due to want to learn from your mistakes, you would want to learn from other people's mistakes. They're much cheaper tuition bills.Learning from others is central to Mr. Griffin's philosophy. But what if you could learn from him? That's what we will do in this article.

MAR, BorgWarner Inc. BWA, D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI, América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. AMX and Triton International Ltd. TRTN.5 Stocks with High ROE to Buy as Debt Ceiling Crisis LingersThe U.S. equity markets witnessed immense volatility in the past couple of trading days as the debt ceiling crisis lingered, with negotiators failing to reach a consensus. The market remained mostly on tenterhooks as a failure to lift the debt ceiling will likely trigger a default, leading to chaos in the financial markets and a spike in interest rates. The impasse rattled investors to such an extent that even a dovish statement from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell (that interest rates might not need to rise as much as expected given the tight credit conditions from the banking crisis) failed to improve the market sentiments.A weaker-than-expected wholesale prices data – often considered a sign of easing inflation – further failed to ease the concerns of a downturn. Wholesale prices rose just 0.2% in April compared with wide expectations of a 0.3% rise. The consumer price index increased 0.4% in April, equating to a 4.9% annual inflation rate – the lowest reading since April 2021. However, continued financial market stress and uncertain business conditions amid a looming debt crisis remained an overhang.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Marriott International, Inc., BorgWarner Inc., D.R. Horton, Inc., América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. and Triton International Ltd. are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Story continuesWhy ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screen:Marriott: Headquartered in Bethesda, MD, Marriott is a leading worldwide hospitality company focused on lodging management and franchising.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for KLA KLA's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Recognition must be given to the that KLA has grown EPS by 58% per year, over the last three years. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. KLA maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 23% to US$11b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of KLA's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are KLA Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$58b company like KLA. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Holding US$85m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.Story continuesDoes KLA Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?KLA's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering KLA for a spot on your watchlist. It is worth noting though that we have found 1 warning sign for KLA that you need to take into consideration.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

For more stocks, head on over to Billionaire Ken Griffin's 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. The stock market crash of 2022 hammered several major hedge funds. One of the biggest funds that bled capital last year is Chase Coleman and Feroze Dewan's Tiger Global. According to Insider Monkey's research, the hedge fund's portfolio as of the first quarter of 2023 was worth a respectable $10.9 billion. Sounds respectable right? After all, it's more money than most of us will likely ever see in our lifetimes (never say never?). Well, you won't think it's a lot of money when you consider the same hedge fund's portfolio by the end of 2022's first quarter. Back then, the portfolio was worth a whopping $26.6 billion, implying that in just a year, Tiger Global's portfolio has been cut by more than half.Another star that crashed last year was Catherine Wood's Ark Investment. Ark is known for obsessing over high growth technology companies, and these are precisely the ones that didn't see any love from the stock market last year. And the turbulence in these areas has also hammered Ark's portfolio. This portfolio, which was worth $23.9 billion by the end of Q1 2022 is currently worth $14.5 billion. Cumulatively speaking, data from LCH Investments - called the fund of funds - shows that the industry lost $208 billion last year and nearly one tenth of this was simply due to Tiger Global.However, not all funds were losers in 2022. The best performing hedge fund during the year was Ken Griffin's Citadel Investments. Citadel made $16 billion last year, nearly twice what the second best performing hedge fund D.E. Shaw Group made. So, undoubtedly, Citadel is the king of the hedge fund world right now. This strong performance made Citadel's founder and owner Mr. Ken Griffin not only one of the richest hedge fund managers in the world but also one of the richest people on the planet. Data from Forbes Magazine shows that Mr. Griffin's current net worth sits at a cool $32.3 billion - making him one of the fifty richest folks all around. Quite an achievement, we'd say, and one that becomes even more impressive when you consider the history of his fortunes. This is due to the fact that as recently as 2020, the billionaire's net worth stood at $12 billion. Looking at this, it would appear as if while the world is up in flames, Mr. Griffin knows how to hold his ground and do what he's best at doing i.e. making cold, hard cash.Story continuesThe billionaire is an alumnus of Harvard University, and he has been investing since his time at college. He set up Citadel just a year after graduating from university, and would soon go on to make high double digit returns. So naturally, his perspective on how to deal with losses and navigate through adversity is nothing less of a goldmine. Well, lucky for us, Mr. Griffin offered some gems during a fireside chat at the Yale School of Management in April 2023, where he shared:Well there's a little saying, a little quip that I like to make. History is written by the winners. Right. So the wonderful history of Citadel is how we're the most profitable hedge fund of all time. The chapter of how we were on the verge of going business in '08 is now like a footnote in that book. All right. That's a very important note. It is now all been an easy march to success. It's had, you know, I think have the interesting position in life I probably lost, my team has probably lost more money that perhaps any other firm in existence. We just happened to have made more money [LAUGHS] than almost any other firm in existence. And it's the net that everyone talks about. I mean there's years when our lost are. . are. . .hundreds of billions of dollars, I don't know if it's hundreds, it's over a hundred, maybe hundreds. It's numbers are incomprehensible, right. So, number is all my losses are my tuition, I have the most expensive education in American history. And a number of my colleagues have education that are becoming competitively - expensive.And I think it's very important, that like, we, in some sense you have have to have a moment of levity, okay? If every time you lost money, you got depressed and angry and you couldn't deal with it, you'd just have a very short career. you'd just have a very short career. So you need to be able to take a step back and go, 'it's a tuition bill I paid.' And it doesn't mean that you don't think very long and hard about what went wrong. But you have to keep it in perspective.In '08 that tuition bill almost became getting expelled from school. Because we were, we lost half of our equity in sixteen weeks, in a firm that had never had a double digit draw down in twenty years. The only reason we survived, and there's a number of reason, but the principle reason we survived is when long term capital failed 1998, I went and met with a number of senior people that worked at Long Term Capital. Why did I do this? What was my agenda? I wanted to understand how does a firm that loses 90% of its equity in a levered financial services industry, still stay in business? Like if you ask me that's one of the greatest accomplishments of all time, was that they lost 90% of their equity before they lost control of their business in a financial services, in a levered financial services company. And much of what we learned from how they survived that was actually fundamentally existentially important to our ability to withstand the turmoil of 2008. So there's a very important lesson here, which is not only due to want to learn from your mistakes, you would want to learn from other people's mistakes. They're much cheaper tuition bills.Learning from others is central to Mr. Griffin's philosophy. But what if you could learn from him? That's what we will do in this article.

Be aware that after a storm, high tides may have carried debris into the water.Monitor your local forecast and create a preparedness plan that you can follow in the event of severe weather. If possible, haul your vessel out of the water before a storm approaches and remove objects that could become airborne.Story continuesBoaters can also benefit from reviewing their insurance policies and talking to their agents to help ensure that they are properly covered.

206,d6dd2a1c-f03e-3966-9a51-fe284b3a478a,APD,2023-05-23,Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) Hasn't Managed To Accelerate Its Returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/air-products-chemicals-nyse-apd-110012218.html,1684839612,STORY,['APD'],"[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Although, when we looked at Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Air Products and Chemicals is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.098 = US$2.6b ÷ (US$29b - US$2.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Air Products and Chemicals has an ROCE of 9.8%. In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Chemicals industry average of 11%. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals roceIn the above chart we have measured Air Products and Chemicals' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Air Products and Chemicals here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEThere are better returns on capital out there than what we're seeing at Air Products and Chemicals. The company has consistently earned 9.8% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 59% in that time. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.What We Can Learn From Air Products and Chemicals' ROCEIn summary, Air Products and Chemicals has simply been reinvesting capital and generating the same low rate of return as before. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 87% over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.Story continuesLike most companies, Air Products and Chemicals does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs  that you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Now.The basic materials industry is huge and includes major segments like oil, metals &amp; mining, chemicals, and other raw materials. The industry often remains in flux amid changing oil and commodity prices. Oil companies account for a major chunk of the basic materials industry. Major oil stocks like ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum are trading in the red this year amid fears of a slowing economy and recession. This lackluster performance of oil companies comes after a huge outperformance of the energy sector last year.Pessimism Around ChinaThe biggest factor that is denting the performance of many energy and commodities companies this year is the pessimism surrounding Chinese economic growth. Earlier this year the market cheered the reopening of China. The world was expecting the demand for commodities to surge as Chinese factories and industries fire up. But the economic growth in China remains slower than expected.For April, China’s indicator of manufacturing activity declined to 49.2 from the previous month’s 51.9 reading. On April 25, copper prices fell to their five-week lows after data indicated a slower-than-expected rebound in activity in China and rising inventors at the London Metal Exchange warehouse system.Talking about the reopening dynamics in China and how it’s affecting iron ore, steel prices and related business of the company, Vale’s management said the following in its latest earnings call:""So we’ve been seeing the recovery in China. Definitely we have strong numbers. You mentioned that GDP FAI very resilient, infrastructure investment properties, we have good news also. So the bright side that we are in the stocking mall in China. So, we see the sales increasing also the accomplishment of construction also increase. You mentioned all the micro numbers, blast furnace going well, we just came from China. It’s a common sense that production will be flat this year. So the production is there. So what is concerning today, so, the first thing is related to property. It is a cycle. So we firstly we need to sell, finish the construction. So land sales and new starts are coming.So that didn’t come yet. So that’s the main volatility that we see in our — even in our clients. They are in a wait and see mode. But everybody’s waiting that for only for the second half. So we are on track and we need to wait for that. I think price in steel, it’s another concern. But the good news is, if you see the export that you had in China, this quarter. That implies that we have a symmetry in the price, ex-China comparing to China. So there is a wind that can help China to improve the price in the steel market. And as a combination of all of this, we have a tepid or really tepid margins steel mill. So with all this, we have this wait and see behavior, we have old inventors are really low. So in our perspective in short-term, we can see a rebound, we have this next holiday that is coming out and they will need to replenish the supply chain.""Story continuesBut as the Federal Reserve mulls a pause on rate hikes, the economy might get back to normal, giving a boost to the materials sector. In December, Goldman Sachs predicted that commodities could give investors over 40% returns in 2023. The firm at the time said that it was expecting the first quarter to be “bumpy” for the sector amid weakness in China and the US. However, the firm was expecting the sector to benefit from the shortage of commodities after the first quarter.Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Shane Cottle on UnsplashMethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked 13 basic materials stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

So that was part of the impact. The other thing you would see in silicones was that, pricing and demand held up relatively well. Some pressure downward on siloxanes pricing in China from new capacity additions there. But I think we’re starting to see that the demand is picking up and that should help smooth things out. So you also saw higher net sales in coatings and monomers and also higher volumes. Some of its supply availability, as I mentioned in silicones and siloxanes, the other is getting ready for seasonally higher volumes going into the second quarter.And then we think we’ll see more of a traditional seasonal pickup in the coatings and monomers segment. Some pressure on architectural coatings, but industrial coatings are looking relatively strong. And I think we’ll have to watch carefully what’s going on with housing starts and housing sales and see how that impacts architectural coatings through the quarter."" Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested articles:10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Fast Food Stocks to Invest In15 Most Tax-Friendly Countries in EuropeDisclosure: None. 13 Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

This investment is intended to retain the thousands of current engineering and manufacturing jobs and support the creation of new jobs as Cummins invests its people and facilities to grow innovation and accelerate decarbonization efforts.Over half of all medium- and heavy-duty trucks on the road in the U.S. today use Cummins engines and the X15N is part of the new fuel-agnostic 15-liter engine platform that will be produced at JEP. This next generation engine is the first natural gas engine to be specifically designed for heavy-duty truck applications with up to 500 horsepower output and is a key step for the future of heavy-duty transportation fleets and a road to zero emissions.""Our plant wouldn’t be successful without the dedicated employees who serve our company and community each day,"" said Anna Dibble, Cummins Jamestown Engine Plant Manager. ""We are proud to have such a strong presence in the community and be able to create a welcoming, caring and all-inclusive environment for our people to be successful.""JEP is a critical piece of Cummins long term Destination Zero strategy and next generation engine portfolio and remains one of the company’s largest manufacturing facilities. The facility has been operating for 49 years and has more than 1,500 employees and serves 1,949 active customers. JEP continues to be the largest private employer in Chautauqua County and the southern tier of New York.About the fuel-agnostic platformThe new fuel-agnostic engine platforms feature a series of engine versions that are derived from a common base engine, which means they have a high degree of parts commonality. Below the head gasket of each engine will largely have similar components and above the head gasket will have different components for different fuel types. Each engine version will operate using a different, single fuel. This new design approach will be applied across the company’s legendary engine portfolios including the REM’s B6.7 and the X15, and the new 10-liter portfolio called the X10.Srikanth Padmanabhan, Vice President and President, Cummins Engine Business, shares his views and expertise on the future about the fuel-agnostic platform: ""Our employees are innovating to find new ways of working that use fewer of the world’s resources, and the Engine Business is at the center of this exciting innovation. Our fuel agnostic platform builds on decades of experience manufacturing industry-leading products. It is essential to our commitment to help customers reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""Cummins is dedicated to improving communities in which it operates to have a direct impact on the lives of its employees and neighbors.

Under a potential transaction, Sky would pay hundreds of million of euros to sell its operations in Germany to Prosiebensat.1, two of the sources said.Shares in Prosiebensat.1 closed 1.8% higher.Comcast, which acquired Sky Deutschland as part of a $40 billion buyout of European pay-TV broadcaster Sky in 2018, is working with advisory firm PJT Partners, sources have previously said. Sky also operates in Italy and Britain. Prosiebensat.1 declined to comment. Sky declined to comment Comcast did not immediately respond to a request for comment.If any deal goes ahead, it could represent a loss for Comcast, which bought Sky Deutschland as part of a $40 billion buyout of European pay-TV broadcaster Sky in 2018.""For Comcast the issue is about sending a message of decisiveness to investors,"" said François Godard, senior media and telecoms analyst at Enders Analysis, adding that Sky did not have enough scale to compete in the German market.""ProSieben and their Joyn platform could be the solution,"" he said.Sky Deutschland was worth roughly 4.44 billion pounds ($5.60 billion) in 2014 when BSkyB took it over as part of a deal involving Sky Italia. Sky Germany has suffered partly because of competition from DAZN over football rights and a general decline in the television market.Talks are at an early stage and there is no certainty any deal will go through, the sources said. All asked not to be named because the talks are not public.They added that no decision had been reached regarding the structure of any merger.One of the sources said Prosiebensat.1 could buy only some parts of Sky's operations.Story continuesA potential combination between Prosiebensat.1 and Sky in Germany had been explored last year. At that time, Prosiebensat.1 had not been interested in pursuing a deal.Since then, it has hired a new CEO and replaced its chief financial officer.A combination with Sky in Germany could complicate any potential buyout approach for Prosiebensat.1, one of the sources said.Czech investment group PPF has built a 13% stake in ProSiebensat.1 over recent months, becoming its second-largest investor behind MFE-MediaforEurope, controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, which has a potential 29% stake, when including derivatives.($1 = 0.7923 pounds)(Additional reporting by Alex Huebner in Berlin; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Barbara Lewis)]"

The volunteer event helped beautify the El Centro de la Raza campus on Beacon Hill as it continues to re-open for public services in 2023.The volunteer project was part of Mayor Harrell’s One Seattle Day of Service – a citywide day of volunteerism to give back and take action to improve the city of Seattle. The day brings together a diverse group of public, private, and non-profit partners and organizations, which provide a wide array of service opportunities including cleaning and beautification, gardening, and restoration, helping neighbors in need, and more.Comcast’s day of service is part of a national partnership with Keep America Beautiful – a national nonprofit that inspires and educates people to take action every day to improve and beautify their community environment. The organization provides the expertise, programs, and resources to help people end littering, improve recycling, beautify America’s public spaces, and restore and support resilient communities.For the health and safety of the community, El Centro de la Raza offered its most essential services in-person during the pandemic with the rest of its programs offered virtually or in a hybrid model. It resumed in-person events and its 43 programs and services on-site earlier this year.El Centro de la Raza is the largest Latino-serving nonprofit in Washington State and offers 126 units of affordable housing, bilingual childcare, a food bank, digital literacy programs, workforce development, and social services for diverse communities across Puget Sound. More than 20,000 people benefit from its programs and services annually.Story continues""The generous donation of time and effort from Comcast’s employees will be instrumental in helping us offer more services sooner on our campus,"" said Estela Ortega, executive director, El Centro de la Raza. “This is just part of our ongoing partnership with Comcast, and we are excited to collaborate on more interesting initiatives with them later this year.”""El Centro de la Raza is an essential part of the Puget Sound community and supporting them through partnership, investment, and volunteering is key to Comcast's ongoing support of diverse communities in our region,” said Rodrigo Lopez, senior vice president of Comcast Pacific Northwest Region. “The work our volunteers put in will make a positive impact and is something our Comcast team in Washington will always remember.”The volunteer effort from Comcast is part of Team UP - Comcast’s national employee volunteer program.

As a part of Project UP, Comcast has launched more than 90 Lift Zones in Washington state to assist families with limited or no internet connection in their homes. Lift Zones provide free, robust WiFi hotspots in safe spaces designed to help students and families get online, participate in distance learning, do homework, search for jobs, and access healthcare information and public assistance.Project UP also includes Internet Essentials, the nation's largest and most comprehensive broadband adoption program.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Devon Energy Devon Energy's Improving ProfitsIn the last three years Devon Energy's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Impressively, Devon Energy's EPS catapulted from US$5.33 to US$9.31, over the last year. It's not often a company can achieve year-on-year growth of 75%.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Devon Energy shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 29% to 44%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Devon Energy's future profits.Are Devon Energy Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Insider interest in a company always sparks a bit of intrigue and many investors are on the lookout for companies where insiders are putting their money where their mouth is. This view is based on the possibility that stock purchases signal bullishness on behalf of the buyer. However, small purchases are not always indicative of conviction, and insiders don't always get it right.Story continuesWe do note that, in the last year, insiders sold US$639k worth of shares. But that's far less than the US$2.4m insiders spent purchasing stock. This adds to the interest in Devon Energy because it suggests that those who understand the company best, are optimistic. Zooming in, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Executive VP &amp; COO Clay Gaspar for US$1m worth of shares, at about US$49.98 per share.The good news, alongside the insider buying, for Devon Energy bulls is that insiders (collectively) have a meaningful investment in the stock. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$194m. This comes in at 0.6% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Is Devon Energy Worth Keeping An Eye On?Devon Energy's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. What's more, insiders own a significant stake in the company and have been buying more shares. This quick rundown suggests that the business may be of good quality, and also at an inflection point, so maybe Devon Energy deserves timely attention. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Devon Energy   (of which 2 are a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.Keen growth investors love to see insider buying.

Now the question is whether President Xi Jinping will go after even bigger targets, risking blowback to his own economy.Most Read from BloombergPutin Orders Tighter Defenses After Drone Strikes on MoscowWinklevoss Twins Attempt Pivot After Gemini Loses Money and EmployeesStock Rally Loses Steam After AI-Fueled Euphoria: Markets WrapTaiwan Rushes to Prevent China From Cutting Internet, PhonesNvidia Touches $1 Trillion Mark After Beating Rivals to AIUntil this week, Beijing hadn’t responded in kind to US moves to kneecap China’s access to advanced chips and other technology, which President Joe Biden has said could be used for military modernization. China has repeatedly blasted the actions as the “long-arm” of US hegemony, while taking few meaningful actions against American companies.The Micron decision, coming shortly after Group of Seven leaders published a communique vowing to counter Beijing’s “economic coercion,” appears to mark a shift in thinking. The action may lead to material damage to a firm that gets 11% of its revenue from China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.However, the damage to Chinese industry is minimal as it easily replace Micron’s memory chips with similar products from local suppliers as well as South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. The real test will be whether China makes any moves against US companies like Qualcomm Inc. and Intel Corp., which make chips used in Chinese smartphones and servers that are much harder to replace.That’s deemed unlikely for now because of the damage it could wreak on China’s domestic supply chain, hurting the nation’s growth at a time when its economic recovery is uncertain. Foreign companies have already been spooked by a crackdown on consulting companies, as well as a range of risks stemming from increased tensions between the world’s biggest economies.Story continues“The approach of limiting US firms like Micron intends to send a signal that Beijing is willing to bear some pain as it contests with the US,” said Ja Ian Chong, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore. “But Beijing is quite careful to limit costs to itself.”Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao on Monday tried to assure foreign businesses that China would protect their interests and rights, showing some effort to limit the damage. He’s set to meet this week with both US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in Washington and US Trade Representative Katherine Tai in Detroit, some of the first high-level meetings in months after relations deteriorated over the shooting down of what the US said was a Chinese spy balloon.China’s new ambassador to the US, Xi Feng, said after arriving to take up the post Tuesday that the relationship between the world’s two biggest economies is facing “serious difficulties and challenges.”“We hope the United States will work together with China to increase dialogue, to manage differences and also to expand our cooperation,” he said after his arrival at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.Xi has struggled for years to find a response to US sanctions, tariffs and export controls that makes China look tough without scaring off foreign companies. While the White House’s sweeping October curbs on advanced semiconductors were aimed at blocking Beijing from a whole industry, the Micron move merely limits the Chinese operations of a single US firm. Beijing also gave itself plenty of flexibility in how to implement the decision.The cyberspace agency highlighted how Micron chips are risky for critical information infrastructure, such as data centers or cloud computing services. But Micron sells most of its chips for less sensitive consumer electronics, including smartphones and laptop computers. Jefferies analysts including Edison Lee highlighted this distinction in a research note, saying the Chinese decision’s impact will be “quite limited.”“China doesn’t really pay a cost for this,” said Evan Medeiros, who worked on China at the National Security Council during the Obama administration and is now a professor of Asian Studies at Georgetown University.“The Micron action shows the Chinese are struggling to find retaliation tools that don’t do them more harm than good,” he added. “It’s not even tit for tat.”Still, some analysts see Micron as the first of many moves after Xi called protecting industrial security the “priority of priorities” at a high-profile meeting earlier this month. At the same time, the US and Europe are moving to “de-risk” supply chains to avoid relying on China for critical materials.“Micron will be the first firm but there are many to come,” said Henry Gao, a professor on Chinese trade law at Singapore Management University. “You see this kind of national security justifications for various matters in China since President Xi came into office. Basically he was saying everything is national security now.”Electric VehiclesOne area where China could retaliate further is the electric vehicle sector, according to Yongwook Ryu, assistant professor specializing in international relations at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.“EVs are one area where Chinese firms can replace US products quite easily and generate benefits for domestic firms such as BYD,” he added, suggesting Tesla Inc. could be a target. The US-based manufacturer has operations in China, including a gigafactory in Shanghai.China has assembled a legal toolkit to retaliate against US sanctions in recent years, such as announcing an “unreliable entity” list in mid-2019. In 2020, it imposed unspecified sanctions against Boeing Co.’s defense unit, Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Technologies Corp. after the US approved $1.8 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, and followed that up with more sanctions, fines and travel bans.Yet China couldn’t enforce those punishments as none of the sanctioned companies or individuals were in China. Beijing avoided targeting Pratt &amp; Whitney, another Raytheon subsidiary, or Boeing itself, both of which have significant business in China.‘Punch Back’Instead, China has tended to use tariffs to punish foreign governments for decisions that cross its so-called red lines, while avoiding curbs that jeopardized its supply chains.After Australia called for the World Health Organization to investigate the origins of Covid-19, for example, China imposed import tariffs or bans on products such as wine and lobsters, but refrained from targeting the critical import of Australian iron ore.Xi has also been careful not to target Taiwanese firms Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. over territorial disputes with the self-ruled island. TSMC supplies China with critical chips the country needs, while Hon Hai hires hundreds of thousands of workers in China to assemble gadgets for Apple Inc.The action against Micron appears “targeted and political,” said Gerard DiPippo, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who worked for more than a decade in US intelligence.“If you’re China and want to pick a notable target in a priority sector that you can scare away and replace without too much damage, Micron seems to fit the bill,” he said. “In general, the Chinese government has been pretty reluctant to retaliate against American firms, because they think the US government will punch back.”--With assistance from Gao Yuan, Kari Lindberg, Rebecca Choong Wilkins, Peter Elstrom and Edwin Chan.(Updates with US envoy in eighth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAssault Allegations Plague a $1.4 Billion Home Eldercare StartupSergey Brin Has a Secret Plan to Put Airships Back in the SkiesAdidas After YeezyYou’re the CEO and Your Company Got Hacked—What Now?There’s Still Scary Stuff in Sunscreen©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The action is an “abuse” of export control measures and goes against free trade and international trade regulations, the statement said.The limits will “severely undermine the interests and rights of Chinese and Japanese companies and China-Japan trade and economic cooperation, damage the landscape of the global semiconductor industry, and impact industrial and supply chain security and stability,” it said. “China will reserve the right to take measures to firmly defend its lawful rights and interests.”The statement came after Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry published details of the restrictions which will take effect on July 23. China has repeatedly complained about the measures since they were announced in March, and last month urged the World Trade Organization to look into export restrictions on the sale of such machines announced by the US, Japan and the Netherlands.

But the move also sparked some gains in Asian chipmaking stocks, as markets bet that local manufacturers will turn to regional chipmakers for their requirements.Broader Asian markets were depressed as U.S. lawmakers failed to agree on a deal to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a default. Still, President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy both expressed optimism over ongoing talks, and downplayed fears of a U.S. default.Story continuesThe prospect of a U.S. default still kept Asian markets on edge, as traders feared the economic fallout from such an event. Soft economic indicators from China also dampened sentiment toward Asian stocks.Among outliers, South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.7%, aided by data showing a recovery in consumer sentiment, while Australia’s ASX 200 rose 0.3%. Business activity data in Australia also read higher-than-expected for May, but manufacturing remained in contraction territory.In Southeast Asia, Thailand’s SET Index fell 0.2%, remaining under pressure as markets awaited the formation of a new government after a surprise victory for the opposition in elections held last week.Related ArticlesAsian stocks dip as Japan rally stalls, debt ceiling uncertainty persistsWeight-loss drug pioneers aim to jump on Wegovy bandwagonAnalysis-US debt ceiling crunch threatens to roil complacent stock market]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG, McDonald's Corporation MCD, Shake Shack Inc. SHAK, Yum China Holdings, Inc. YUMC and J D Wetherspoon plc JDWPY.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:5 Restaurant Stocks to Buy TodayThe retail sector today is a study in contrasts.It’s no secret that escalating food prices are shrinking disposable income, making bargain hunting a big factor in retail. As one would expect, this is helping discounters maintain volumes (Refinitiv data shows BJ’s Wholesale, Walmart and Costco all on track to report Q1 gains of 6.0%, 5.5% and 5.0%, respectively).On the other end however, the Hotels, Restaurant &amp; Leisure sector is headed for a Q1 growth rate of 3245.6% from last year. Understandably, with people traveling and socializing so much, things like cosmetics are also doing well. Ulta Beauty, for example, is on track to record 8.7% growth.Overall, the Refinitiv U.S. Retail and Restaurant Q1 earnings index, which tracks changes in the earnings per share (EPS) of companies in the retail and restaurant sector, is expected to grow 30.9% in the first quarter of 2023.Retail earnings are expected to grow 25.7%, constrained by declines in the department store and apparel segments, as a result of the continued shift to online shopping, rising prices (which hurts demand for discretionary items) and a weak economy (and resultant softness in consumer spending).The Restaurants segment is therefore the main driver of growth, with segment earnings expected to grow 36.1% in the first quarter. Restaurant earnings are being driven by things like the continued recovery in dining out as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the strong demand for delivery and carryout as conveniences that just can’t be sacrificed now, and the rising prices of food and labor, which are being passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.Story continuesThe monthly retail sales data from the Commerce Department shows that the spike in January was followed by declines in the following two months. The expectation is for a modest recovery in April (final numbers have not yet been released).Retail data is particularly significant in the current environment because it is a gauge of the strength in consumers, the main factor holding off a recession right now. Therefore, everyone is looking at Retail.Restaurants are clearly looking up, based on the Industry Rank of #46, placing this group in the top 18% of 250+ Zacks-classified industries. Buy-rated stocks that belong to these top industries have an outsized chance of near-term appreciation in share prices. Therefore, this is one of the segments that we should be looking at for winners:Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.Newport Beach, CA-based Chipotle beat March quarter estimates by 18.1% on revenue that beat by 1.4%. The company’s estimates for 2023 and 2024 jumped a respective 5.7% and 3.8% in the last 30 days. At these levels, they represent 13.9% revenue growth and 33.4% earnings growth for 2023 and 12.4% revenue growth and 19.7% earnings growth for 2024.CMG shares are up 48.6% year to date but are still trading at a discount to their high point over the past year. Since this is despite the fact that prospects continue to improve, further upside from these levels seems likely.McDonald's CorporationChicago-based McDonald's Corp. beat earnings and revenue estimates for the March quarter by 13.9% and 5.8%, respectively. Its estimates have increased 5.0% and 3.7% in the last 30 days. Analysts currently expect its revenue and earnings to grow 7.7% and 9.2% in 2023 and by 7.0% and 9.5% the following year.MCD shares are up 11.3% year to date. Since it is trading close to its median valuation over the past year, despite improving prospects and strong estimate revisions, we may expect upside from the current level.Shake Shack Inc.New York-based Shake Shack reported a revenue surprise of 3.1% and earnings surprise of 88.9% in the March quarter. Thereafter, its 2023 and 2024 earnings estimates have jumped 400% and 375%, respectively. Whereas it was earlier reporting losses, analysts think it will now generate profits. The 129.0% earnings growth expected in 2023 will be based on revenue growth of 21.3%. Additionally, earnings growth of 111.1% in 2024 will be based on revenue growth of 16.2%.The shares are up 62.3% year to date, and judging from the above, further upside is in the cards.Yum China Holdings, Inc.Shanghai, China-based Yum China is the largest restaurant company in China, with over 13,000 restaurants across over 1,800 Chinese cities. Its two operating segments are KFC and Pizza Hut although it has many other brands including KFC, Pizza Hut, Little Sheep, Huang Ji Huang, Lavazza, COFFii &amp; JOY, Taco Bell, and East Dawning brands, which specialize in chicken, pizza, hot pot cooking, simmer pot, Italian coffee, specialty coffee, Mexican-style food, and Chinese food categories. V-Gold Mall, its mobile e-commerce platform, sells electronics, home and kitchen accessories, and other general merchandise, as well as fried rice, steak, pasta and other meals. In addition, it operates franchise restaurants under the KFC, Pizza Hut, Huang Ji Huang, Taco Bell, Little Sheep, East Dawning, Lavazza and COFFii &amp; JOY names.After beating earnings estimates by 60.5% and revenue estimates by 3.1% in the March quarter, Yum China’s estimates for 2023 and 2024 jumped a respective 8.9% and 5.7%. Analysts currently expect revenue and earnings growth of 19.6% and 85.7% in 2023 followed by 12.8% and 22.8% in 2024.The shares are up 12.0% year to date. And although trading at a premium to the S&amp;P 500, they’re still at a discount to their median value over the past year (based on P/E). Given the growth prospects, the Chinese reopening and analyst optimism, the shares are likely to trade higher.J D Wetherspoon plcWatford, UK-based J D Wetherspoon owns and operates pubs and hotels in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.J D Wetherspoon’s estimates are on the rise. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for 2023 and 2024 are up 10% and 8.4% in the last seven days. This represents earnings growth of 227.9% in 2023 and 40.6% in 2024. Revenue growth is of course expected to be much slower at 125.0% and 3.8%, respectively.The shares are up 77.9% year to date.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at Inside Scoop: 5 Mid-Cap Stocks with Recent Insider Purchases.""This Is A Market Where You Have To Be Very Selective, Very Patient, Very Defensive""On May 18 Cheryl Young, private wealth advisor for the Rockefeller family office, appeared in an interview on CNBC where she shared her insights on the current market conditions and offered advice for investors. Young emphasized the importance of being selective, patient, and defensive in an increasingly narrow market.Young talked about the recent market trends and their relation to the debt ceiling negotiations. Young expressed optimism, highlighting that ""politicians cannot commit political suicide"". She anticipates an agreement regarding the debt ceiling will be reached soon and thinks that short-term volatility is a buying opportunity for investors. However, she also cautioned that there may still be some downside risk ahead in the broader market.Young acknowledged the frustration of being stuck in a ""sideways market"" for two years, with the S&amp;P 500 at the same level as it was in April 2021. To navigate this environment, she stressed the need for selectivity and patience. According to Young, breakout opportunities may arise in certain sectors and specific stocks, but the overall market might still face challenges.Young spoke about mega-cap leadership and how a few select players have been dominating the market. Young thinks that ""this is the most narrow range we have ever seen in stocks"" and pointed out that the top 10 mega-cap stocks on the S&amp;P 500 make up for a staggering 95% of the year-to-date returns, as of May 18. Moreover, she said that even the top five mega-cap names on the S&amp;P 500 represent 75% of the market's year-to-date returns. While some debate the significance of this concentration of a few select mega-cap players, Young believes it warrants attention and suggests a cautious approach. Here are some comments from Cheryl Young:Story continues""We're really seeing a few stocks move and drive the market momentum, but it causes us a lot of concern that the rest of the markets have not rallied with these big mega-cap names.""Though Young is cautious about the broader market, she remains optimistic about the potential for growth, particularly in the technology sector. Young thinks ""there are a lot of areas that have upside ahead, especially in the technology sector"".Young further talked about some potential concerns. She mentioned the decline in the M2 money supply and the commercial real estate market. Additionally, the looming influx of adjustable rate mortgages in the coming year, coupled with rising interest rates, raises the possibility of a recession.Despite these concerns, Young maintains her belief that now is still a good time to invest in stocks. She thinks investors should exercise caution and selectivity in navigating the current market. Young thinks investors should add defensive strategies to their portfolios and remain invested for the long term.It is worth noting that amid the cautionary sentiment in the broader market, there is an aspect of the market that can provide valuable clues for investors: insider trading.

Impinj offers a wireless inventory-management and tracking platform for customers in retail, manufacturing, health care and other areas. Tiny radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips are used to connect, count and track individual items. Because Impinj is heavily reliant on integrated circuits, which were in short supply during the post-pandemic rebound, today’s slowing economy helps reduce this supply-and-demand imbalance, benefiting the company’s profitability. The stock soared when Impinj’s third-quarter earnings report and management’s forward guidance were well received by investors. Given the magnitude of the move in the stock, we sold some of our shares but maintained a healthy position.”7.

There was even a documentary made about the fight between the billionaires. Ironically, Icahn’s firm Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP) is now on the receiving end of an attack by well-known short-seller Hindenburg Research. According to Bloomberg: “Icahn has been using money taken in from new investors to pay out dividends to old investors,” Hindenburg said in the report. “Such Ponzi-like economic structures are sustainable only to the extent that new money is willing to risk being the last one ‘holding the bag.’”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhile I do not include Icahn Enterprises in my list of three stocks that activist investors may need to swoop in and save, you could make the case based on Hindenburg’s report. Instead, I’ve sought out three other names that ought to be on activist investors’ to-do lists. NWLNewell Brands$8.89VFCVF Corporation$20.77TSNTyson Foods$49.97Newell Brands (NWL)A photo of a sign showing the Newell Brands (NWL) logo outside a building.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comOnce upon a time, long before Newell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) became a conglomeration of more than 100 consumer brands, it was a good company. In 1999, Newell Co. acquired Rubbermaid for $5.8 billion in stock after Rubbermaid’s long-time CEO, Stanley Gault, retired. The company went downhill quickly, so Newell pounced. Newell had spent three decades buying over 75 companies. Its game plan has always been to acquire a company, cut costs, raise margins and deliver shareholder value. In the case of Rubbermaid, Newell management said at the time that they would add $300 million to $350 million in operating income by 2000 due to the buyout. In 1997, Newell had operating income of $572 million. By 2000, it had an operating income of $832 million — up $260 million but not quite hitting the mark — on $6.9 billion in revenue. Two decades later, Newell Brands’ 2022 operating income was $312 million, less than half its 2000 figure, on $9.5 billion in revenue. So, while revenue is 38% higher than in 2000, the company is far less profitable. Story continuesIronically, Icahn brokered a deal in April to end a proxy battle with hedge fund Starboard Value. Some other activists ought to pick up the torch. Down 66% in the past five years, Newell could just be the worst stock in the S&amp;P 500.VF Corporation (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comVF Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is an apparel conglomerate with well-known brands such as Vans, Timberland, The North Face, Supreme and Dickies. The company has faced little activism over the years. However, it did take some heat in 2018 when it banned a shareholder from the annual meeting. Other than that, it’s been pretty quiet. However, VF’s stock is in a freefall. Down 25% year to date, 57% over the past year and 72% over the past five years, a $10,000 investment in May 2018 would be worth just $2,800 today. In early May, VFC stock got a bit of a boost when Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow upgraded it from “sell” to “hold,” suggesting that the problems that plagued it were in the rearview mirror. Boruchow also said that its Vans sneaker brand, which until 2022 had been the company’s strongest performer, was on the mend. And he suggested the company’s dividend cut will likely help it fund future growth. That’s all well and good, but when a stock has performed as poorly as VFC, something must be done before shareholders see all of its value evaporate. Perhaps activist investors are the answer.Tyson Foods (TSN)A package of Tyson Foods (TSN) chicken breasts.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comHow is it that Tyson Foods (NYSE: TSN) Chief Financial Officer (CFO) John R. Tyson still has a job while 10% of the company’s corporate staff will lose theirs? Tyson was arrested in November for entering a stranger’s house while intoxicated and sleeping half-naked in one of the bedrooms. Apparently, getting drunk and sleeping it off in the wrong house isn’t cause for dismissal, but being the poor sap whose name is selected out of a hat as part of a job reduction plan is.Tyson is the largest processor of chicken and beef in the U.S. Its brands include Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farms, Ball Park and Sara Lee. The company reported an operating loss in the second quarter of $49 million, down from a $1.16 billion operating profit a year ago. Meanwhile, shares are down nearly 20% YTD, 46% over the past year and more than 26% over the past five years. Like the other two names on my list, you would think activist investors would have a field day with Tyson. It’s got some well-known brands and a key position in America’s food chain, yet it continues to sputter. Unfortunately, the Tyson family has a 20% economic interest in the company and controls 71% of the votes. However, just because you can’t take down the Tysons doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try.        On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

256,1b08b545-eb7e-3bb9-b7c3-3b5bc82a71d3,PCAR,2023-05-23,Paccar (PCAR) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paccar-pcar-incredible-growth-stock-164502234.html,1684773902,STORY,['PCAR'],"[Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Paccar (PCAR) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this truck maker a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Paccar is 4.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 36.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -0.2%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Paccar has an S/TA ratio of 0.95, which means that the company gets $0.95 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.32, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Paccar looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 14.4% this year versus the industry average of 11%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Paccar have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 19.1% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Paccar a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Paccar is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For more stocks, head on over to Bill Gates' Most Recent Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Today's age is the information age. If you have a smartphone and an internet connection, you can look up vast amounts of information sufficient to form an informed opinion on a variety of topics. One such topic is global wealth, and one of the most well known billionaires ever since the growth of the internet is Bill Gates.Mr. Gates, responsible for setting up one of the world's largest technology companies, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), has dominated the global rich list for several years. Bill Gates was the first person in human history to cross $100 billion in total worth, during the peak of the dotcom era as Microsoft's shares boomed during the peak of the bubble. Mr. Gates first made it on Forbes' billionaire list in 1987 and became the world's richest person in 1995. This kicked off a period of dominance by Mr. Gates, as he maintained that spot until 2008 when he lost the title to the Mexican business tycoon Carlos Slim. This would be a short lived victory for Mr. Slim, as the Microsoft billionaire would retake the top spot a year later and maintain the position until 2010 to lose the title once again for three years and regain it in 2017. Gates only lost the richest person title after he donated $55 billion of his wealth to the Gates Foundation. Safe to say, for Mr. Gates, being the world's richest person is as normal as filing taxes for the rest of us.These days, Bill Gates is the sixth richest person in the world, and by our estimates, he really couldn't care less. His net worth, according to Forbes Magazine, is $114 billion, and according to the magazine's estimates, $30 billion of this fortune is held in cash. Quite a sizeable bank balance, we'd say. While the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is one of the best known investment vehicles for Mr. Gates, the billionaire also runs his family office called Cascade Investment. Cascade is also managed by the Gates Foundation's manager Michael Larson. Mr. Gates is the only owner of Cascade, and the firm's SEC filings reveal investments in a variety of firms such as AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO), Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL), Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI), and Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE).Story continuesThe foundation of Bill Gates' wealth is built on software. His firm Microsoft is the largest company in the world in terms of market share of the personal computing operating systems market. He has seen the computing industry since its inception, and naturally, this provides him with a unique perspective and insight into the industry. Given the current hype surrounding artificial intelligence, it's relevant to see his take on the matter. Fortunately for us, Mr. Gates shared his thoughts on the matter in March 2023 Microsoft podcast where he outlined:A.I. has always been the holy grail of computer science. And, when I was young, Stanford Research had Shaky the Robot that was trying to pick things up. There were various logic systems that people were working on. You know so the dream was always some sort of reasoning capability. Overall progress in A.I., until machine learning came along, So was pretty modest. Even speech recognition was just barely reasonable. So we had that gigantic acceleration with machine learning particularly in sort of sensory things, recognizing speech, recognizing pictures. And it was phenomenal. And it just, you know kept getting better and scale was part of that. But we were still missing anything that had to do with complex logic. With being able to say read a text, and do what a human does, which is quote and understand what's in that text. And so as Microsoft was doing more with Open AI, I had a chance to go see them myself independently a number of times. They were doing a lot of text generation, they had a robot arm. The early text generation still didn't seem to have a broad understanding, you know like it could generate a sentence saying Joe's in Chicago, and then two sentences later say Joe's in Seattle which its local probabilistic sense was a good sentence but a human has a broad understanding of the world from both experience and reading. That you understand, that can't be. So they were enthusing about GPT-3 and even the early versions of GPT-4, I said to them, 'hey, if you can pass an advanced placement biology exam, where you take a question that's not part of the training set, or a bunch of them, and give fully reasoned answers knowing that biology textbook is one of many things that's in that training corps, then you will really get my attention because that would be a heck of a milestone. So, you know, please work on that.' I thought you know that would, they'd go away for two or three years. Because my intuition has always been we needed to understand knowledge representation and symbolic reasoning in a more explicit way. So that we were one or two inventions short of something where it was very good at reading and writing. And therefore being an assistant and so it was amazing that [they] over the summer were saying, yeah it might not be that long before we're going to come demo this thing to you because it's actually doing pretty well on scientific learning.So, with these details in mind, let's take a look at Bill Gates' top stock picks for 2023 out of which the biggest stakes are in Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).Bill Gates' Most Recent Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned the Q1'2023 portfolio of Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and picked the top 15 stocks in terms of stake value.Bill Gates' Most Recent Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks15.

Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 1.5%, which is below the industry average. View our latest analysis for American Express American Express' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. However, prior to this announcement, American Express' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 44.2%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 18%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendAmerican Express Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.80 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.40. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 12% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. American Express has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 23% per annum. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.American Express Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NiSource NI, NewJersey Resources NJR and Campbell Soup CPB.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Conagra is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that is a leading branded food company. It specializes in the production, distribution and marketing of a wide range of packaged food products, with a diverse portfolio of well-known brands.The stock experienced selling for most of the year, which has the stock down about 9% on the year. Investors just have not been excited about the short-term growth prospects with higher costs issues as a major headwind. And when you look at the chart, we see sideways action for the last three years.But longer-term investors might be starting to find some value in a company that continues to beat earnings and pays a healthy dividend.About the CompanyConagra was founded in 1919 and is headquartered in Chicago, IL. The company employs over 18,000 and has a market cap of $17 billion. The stock has a Forward P/E of 13 and pays a dividend of 3.7%.Conagra operates in various categories including frozen meals, snacks, condiments, sauces, soups, desserts, and more.Some iconic brands of the company are Reddi-Wip, Hunt's, Healthy Choice, Frontera, Slim Jim, Blake's and Marie Callender.The stock has a Zacks Style Score of “C” in Value and Growth, but “F” in momentum.Value and RisksAs the stock has come in this year, the value prospects for the stock have become greater. The P/E of 13, is below other packaged peers, which averages around 19. With a nice dividend just under the 4% area, any further drop in the stock price should see buyers come in based on valuation.The main risk for the stock is a lack of growth combined with higher commodity prices. However, this is priced into the stock and the recent and continued drop in commodity prices could start to become a tailwind for the company in the back half of the year.Story continuesQ3 Earnings BeatIn early April, the company reported an earnings beat of 19%. This was the fifth straight EPS beat and the ninth beat out of the last ten quarters.Digging into the third quarter, the company reported EPS of $0.76 v the $0.64 expected. Revenues came in at $3.09B, which was as expected.Conagra raised its FY23 EPS to $2.70-2.75 and narrowed its organic revenue to +7-7.5%. The FY23 operating margins midpoint was raised as productivity and service level improvement helped operating margins recover.Year over year Grocery and Snacks were up 3.7%, the Refrigerated &amp; Frozen Segment was up 5.6% and international sales were up 9.5%.Organic sales were up 6.1%, which was driven by a 15.1% improvement in price/mix. Although, this was offset by a 9% decrease in volume. Even so, the higher prices have had less impact than they have historically.The company has successfully navigated higher input costs by raising prices. Margins are recovering and this is helping longer-term earnings estimates tick higher.Analyst EstimatesThe stock meandered after earnings and recently took a leg lower. Now CAG is trading close to 2023 lows after a mostly positive earnings report.The reasoning behind the bearishness is the focus on growth rather than value. Additionally, short-term estimates just aren’t that exciting.For the current quarter, estimates have ticked lower since EPS, moving from $0.64 to $0.61. Analysts still see short-term headwinds with higher costs.However, the long-term view looks much better. For the current year, estimates have ticked higher since EPS, going from $2.66 to $2.75 or 3%.Looking at next year, we also see estimates trending the right way. Over the last 60 days, numbers have gone from $2.75 to $2.83, also 3%.The TechnicalsWhen you look at the chart, CAG has not done much since 2015. Minus the COVID crash, the stock has basically traded sideways with $35 being the consistent level.As the stock approaches this area, there seems to be a buyable setup for both the short and long-term approaches.The stock recently broke the 200-day moving average. This is typically a negative, but sometimes when this happens, weak hands are taken out of the market and the stock can bounce rather quickly. For CAG, this scenario last played out in early March. The stock broke the 200-day MA at 35.50, fell under $35, but rallied to $39 in under a month’s time. This was a quick 10% gain for any short-term trader that recognized the opportunity.While this pattern might not repeat itself, longer-term traders should be starting positions around the $35 area. This has been a stronghold for over half a decade and creates a solid risk/reward scenario. Additionally, investors have a dividend of almost 4% that they can collect while they wait for the company to navigate the current inflationary environment.Bottom LineConagra is coming into its long-term support area and considering the earnings momentum, dividend, and value seen in the name, now is the time to start considering the stock.Short-term investors have a nice setup for a bounce at current levels. Long-term investors should consider this dividend-paying consumer staple name as part of their portfolio.Bear of the Day:Boot Barn is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that operates as a lifestyle retail chain devoted to western and work-related footwear, apparel, and accessories. It offers boots, shirts, jackets, hats, belts and belt buckles, handbags, western-style jewelry, rugged footwear, outerwear, overalls, denim, and flame-resistant and high-visibility clothing.Investors had been having a great year, with the stock taking off in January and accelerating higher after a solid earnings report that month. At its peak, the stock was up about over 40 % on the year.But almost all of the gains have been erased after a very disappointing earnings report took the stock down 15% in one day.About the CompanyBoot Barn is headquartered in Irvine, CA.The company was founded in 1978 and employs over 4,000 people.Boot Barn has 315 stores across 40 states and sells its products through e-commerce websites, including bootbarn.com; sheplers.com; and countryoutfitter.com.BOOT is valued at $2 billion and has a Forward PE of 12. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of “A” in Growth, “A” in Value, but “C” in Momentum. The stock pays no dividend.Q4 EarningsBoot Barn reported earnings for Q4 on May 17th, beating expectations by 5%. This was the eleventh straight EPS beat, which started back in 2020. During that stretch, the earnings momentum took the stock from $20 to $134 at its peak. However, the magnitude of the beats has gotten smaller and failed to impress investors.Unfortunately for investors, the company guided Q1 and FY24 lower.Boot Barn now expects Q1 at $0.79-0.85 v the $1.23 expected. Revenues are expected much lower and SSS are expected -9% to -7%.For FY24, the company now expects $4.70-5.00 v the $6.07 previously. They see SSS at -6.5% to -4.5%The guide lower took the stock down over 15%.EstimatesThe bad guide forced analysts to take their estimates lower.Over the last 7 days, numbers for the current quarter plummeted from $1.23 to $0.87, or 28%.For the current year, analysts lowered estimates from $5.93 to $5.24, or 12%.Technical TakeThe stock was holding up well last year and even saw a big rally to start the year. But after the earnings report, BOOT has fallen to the lower end of the 2022 trading range. The move also broke the 200-day moving average for the first time since January.The bulls have lost the momentum and will need to get price back above the 200-day at $69 to take control back. Until then, investors should be cautious as the stock could trend lower.The $60 level could offer support, but if not, look for the 2022 low at $50 to be challenged.In SummaryFor the bulls to pull themselves up by the bootstraps, they will need some help in the coming quarters. Until there is a fundamental improvement in earnings estimates or a technical move back above the 200-day, the stock will struggle.Additional content:Wall Street Braces for Debt Ceiling Crisis: 3 Safe PicksThe dilemma over increasing the U.S. debt ceiling at the moment is creating panic among investors. President Joe Biden recently said that the Republicans’ latest proposal on lifting the debt ceiling is “quite frankly, unacceptable.”House Speaker Kevin McCarthy alleged that White House officials are backpedaling in discussions over raising the debt ceiling during the weekend. In reality, GOP negotiators halted the continuing talks over pushing up the debt ceiling, raising uncertainties about an arrangement being reached shortly.However, the Jun 1 deadline is coming up, and the U.S. Government may run out of money to pay for its expenses unless Congress gives the go-ahead to borrow further.Now, if the Government is not in a position to pay for its debts, there would be pandemonium across global economies. The Government won’t be able to finance any of its operations and provide funds for national defense, medical, and various other social security prerogatives.Credit rating agencies invariably would downgrade the economy, borrowing costs would surge, and consumer sentiment could take a beating, eventually tipping the economy into a recession. Millions of people may lose their jobs, and such worries may compel investors to sell U.S. treasury bonds, leading to a weaker dollar and a lot of gyration in the stock market.Thus, raising the debt ceiling has now become imperative, and approval from both chambers of Congress is the need of the hour. But since negotiations to increase the debt ceiling paused in Washington, Wall Street should undeniably brace for volatility. This calls for placing bets on risk-adjusted stocks that remain unperturbed by market instability.These stocks flaunt a low beta (ranges from 0 to 1) that helps them counter market vagaries. They also provide dividends, indicating a sound business model. At the same time, these stocks are non-cyclical in nature. In other words, these are defensive stocks that exist in the utilities and consumer staples sectors.  Demand for their products and services like electricity, gas, water, and food remains unaltered during recession-induced market mayhem.We have, thus, selected three stocks from the aforesaid areas that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). The search was also narrowed down with a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth, and M for Momentum; the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

The regulated and non-regulated business model, along with acquisitions, will further boost its performance.   CWT - which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) - faces risks related to changes in regulations and aging water infrastructure.TailwindsCalifornia Water invested $82 million in capital improvements during first-quarter 2023. The estimated capital expenditure for 2023 and 2024 is $360 million and $365 million, respectively.CWT’s customer base is likely to witness an uptrend in 2023 due to continued acquisitions and organic efforts. Multiple acquisitions completed by the company would add more than 6,700 customers to its existing base.The consistent performance of the company helps it continue with its shareholder-friendly moves. In April 2023, it declared a quarterly dividend of 26 cents per share, marking the utility’s 313th consecutive quarterly dividend. CWT’s times interest earned ratio was 2.4 at the end of the first quarter of 2023, which indicates that it has ample liquidity to meet its near-term obligations.HeadwindsCalifornia Water operates in a highly regulated environment and any changes in existing laws and conditions could increase the operating costs. There is no assurance that the commission would approve rate increases to cover these additional costs, thereby adversely impacting the company's business.The aging water infrastructure, risk of contaminated water supply and changes in demand due to weather conditions are other major concerns that might damage the utility’s financial condition and reputation.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked utilities in the same sector are NiSource NI, Global Water Resources GWRS and SJW Group SJW, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

For more stocks, head on over to Billionaire Ken Griffin's 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. The stock market crash of 2022 hammered several major hedge funds. One of the biggest funds that bled capital last year is Chase Coleman and Feroze Dewan's Tiger Global. According to Insider Monkey's research, the hedge fund's portfolio as of the first quarter of 2023 was worth a respectable $10.9 billion. Sounds respectable right? After all, it's more money than most of us will likely ever see in our lifetimes (never say never?). Well, you won't think it's a lot of money when you consider the same hedge fund's portfolio by the end of 2022's first quarter. Back then, the portfolio was worth a whopping $26.6 billion, implying that in just a year, Tiger Global's portfolio has been cut by more than half.Another star that crashed last year was Catherine Wood's Ark Investment. Ark is known for obsessing over high growth technology companies, and these are precisely the ones that didn't see any love from the stock market last year. And the turbulence in these areas has also hammered Ark's portfolio. This portfolio, which was worth $23.9 billion by the end of Q1 2022 is currently worth $14.5 billion. Cumulatively speaking, data from LCH Investments - called the fund of funds - shows that the industry lost $208 billion last year and nearly one tenth of this was simply due to Tiger Global.However, not all funds were losers in 2022. The best performing hedge fund during the year was Ken Griffin's Citadel Investments. Citadel made $16 billion last year, nearly twice what the second best performing hedge fund D.E. Shaw Group made. So, undoubtedly, Citadel is the king of the hedge fund world right now. This strong performance made Citadel's founder and owner Mr. Ken Griffin not only one of the richest hedge fund managers in the world but also one of the richest people on the planet. Data from Forbes Magazine shows that Mr. Griffin's current net worth sits at a cool $32.3 billion - making him one of the fifty richest folks all around. Quite an achievement, we'd say, and one that becomes even more impressive when you consider the history of his fortunes. This is due to the fact that as recently as 2020, the billionaire's net worth stood at $12 billion. Looking at this, it would appear as if while the world is up in flames, Mr. Griffin knows how to hold his ground and do what he's best at doing i.e. making cold, hard cash.Story continuesThe billionaire is an alumnus of Harvard University, and he has been investing since his time at college. He set up Citadel just a year after graduating from university, and would soon go on to make high double digit returns. So naturally, his perspective on how to deal with losses and navigate through adversity is nothing less of a goldmine. Well, lucky for us, Mr. Griffin offered some gems during a fireside chat at the Yale School of Management in April 2023, where he shared:Well there's a little saying, a little quip that I like to make. History is written by the winners. Right. So the wonderful history of Citadel is how we're the most profitable hedge fund of all time. The chapter of how we were on the verge of going business in '08 is now like a footnote in that book. All right. That's a very important note. It is now all been an easy march to success. It's had, you know, I think have the interesting position in life I probably lost, my team has probably lost more money that perhaps any other firm in existence. We just happened to have made more money [LAUGHS] than almost any other firm in existence. And it's the net that everyone talks about. I mean there's years when our lost are. . are. . .hundreds of billions of dollars, I don't know if it's hundreds, it's over a hundred, maybe hundreds. It's numbers are incomprehensible, right. So, number is all my losses are my tuition, I have the most expensive education in American history. And a number of my colleagues have education that are becoming competitively - expensive.And I think it's very important, that like, we, in some sense you have have to have a moment of levity, okay? If every time you lost money, you got depressed and angry and you couldn't deal with it, you'd just have a very short career. you'd just have a very short career. So you need to be able to take a step back and go, 'it's a tuition bill I paid.' And it doesn't mean that you don't think very long and hard about what went wrong. But you have to keep it in perspective.In '08 that tuition bill almost became getting expelled from school. Because we were, we lost half of our equity in sixteen weeks, in a firm that had never had a double digit draw down in twenty years. The only reason we survived, and there's a number of reason, but the principle reason we survived is when long term capital failed 1998, I went and met with a number of senior people that worked at Long Term Capital. Why did I do this? What was my agenda? I wanted to understand how does a firm that loses 90% of its equity in a levered financial services industry, still stay in business? Like if you ask me that's one of the greatest accomplishments of all time, was that they lost 90% of their equity before they lost control of their business in a financial services, in a levered financial services company. And much of what we learned from how they survived that was actually fundamentally existentially important to our ability to withstand the turmoil of 2008. So there's a very important lesson here, which is not only due to want to learn from your mistakes, you would want to learn from other people's mistakes. They're much cheaper tuition bills.Learning from others is central to Mr. Griffin's philosophy. But what if you could learn from him? That's what we will do in this article.

LogicSource’s deep understanding of the retail landscape, coupled with its proven track record, positions it as the go-to partner for companies seeking to optimize their indirect spend and drive sustainable growth.Businesses across other sectors have also realized the critical importance of efficient procurement processes and the need to mitigate risks. In fact, the pandemic prompted LogicSource to diversify into consumer packaged goods and healthcare.Opportunities in healthcare abound.

Those companies have plenty of costs to cut but generally won’t have an internal procurement team that’s as effective as LogicSource.The numbers back up LogicSource’s impressive story. In an era when many young companies remain in the red, LogicSource boasts a five-year track record of profitability. It’s also growing at a blistering pace, with an expected revenue growth rate of 170% from 2020 to 2023.It also manages a whopping $85 billion in spend and pricing data for its aggregate client base.

The husband-and-wife pair shake up country with full-bodied soulful delivery, engaging live instrumentation, and bilingual lyrics, introducing themselves as Nashville’s most compelling outliers. Kat is a Miami native and first-generation American from a Cuban family. Alex, who is of Puerto Rican descent, grew up in Northwestern Georgia and moved to Miami by middle school. Their paths crossed after Kat witnessed Alex singing one day at their church, and the two quickly forged an eternal bond after meeting up to collaborate. They appeared on American Idol individually before returning home to focus on writing and recording original music as a duo, and then made their way to Nashville in 2020, igniting a life-altering couple of years. Last year Kat &amp; Alex released Side A of their self-titled, debut EP, which featured songs such as ""I Want It All"" and ""We Bought A House."" The duo then made history by releasing Lado B, an entirely Spanish version of the EP. The project received acclaim in The Tennessean, Billboard, CMT and others. Kat &amp; Alex were named to Nashville Lifestyle’s ""Most Beautiful People"" list last year, singled out as an Emerging Latin Artist to Discover by Billboard, and deemed ""well on their way to stardom"" by People Magazine. This year, the pair continues representing Hispanic culture in country music with a sound that’s rich and soulful with velvet harmonies, pop-like vocal riffs, and hooky lyrics.KatandAlex.com | Facebook | Instagram | TikTok | YouTubeView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230522005291/en/ContactsFlyteVuBrittany Rashkin(561) 314-5359brittany.rashkin@flytevu.comTractor Supply CompanyMary Winn Pilkington(615) 440-4212Tricia Whittemore(615) 440-4410corporatecommunications@tractorsupply.com]"

INSP is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its product innovations. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and a few regulatory approvals are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding overdependence on the Inspire system and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 74.1% against the industry’s 26.4% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 5.9% growth.The renowned medical technology company focused on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has a market capitalization of $8.99 billion. The company projects 26.3% growth for 2023 and expects to maintain its strong performance. Inspire Medical delivered an earnings surprise of 43.3% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Product Innovation: We are optimistic about Inspire Medical’s commitment to driving innovation, which has allowed it to achieve continuous, significant improvements in its Inspire therapy. On the first-quarter earnings call, management confirmed that the company had been continuing operational and production qualification as well as integration with the Inspire digital tools, specifically sleep sync.On the same call, management also stated that Inspire Medical’s SleepSync system continues to progress well since the launch of the Bluetooth-enabled patient remote.Regulatory Approvals: We are upbeat about Inspire Medical’s receipt of a slew of FDA approvals over the past few months. In March, the company received the FDA’s approval to offer Inspire therapy to pediatric patients with Down syndrome. The same month, Inspire Medical announced that it had received countrywide reimbursement approval in Belgium, effective immediately, at rates consistent with other countries around the world for the Inspire therapy.Strong Q1 Results: Inspire Medical’s solid first-quarter 2023 results buoy our optimism. The company recorded a robust improvement in the top line and strength in year-over-year geographic results. Activation of new U.S. centers and the creation of new U.S. sales territories were also recorded during the reported quarter.Story continuesDownsidesOverdependence on the Inspire System: Sales of Inspire Medical’s Inspire system accounted for primarily all its revenues in the past few years. The company’s ability to execute its growth strategy and become profitable will, therefore, depend upon the adoption of the Inspire therapy to treat moderate-to-severe OSA in patients who are unable to use or get consistent benefits from continuous positive airway pressure. Management cannot ensure that the company’s Inspire therapy will achieve or maintain broad market acceptance among physicians and patients.Stiff Competition: The medical technology industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Inspire Medical’s competitors have historically dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to promote their products or develop new products or methods to treat moderate-to-severe OSA.Estimate TrendInspire Medical has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for loss per share has narrowed from $1.32 to $1.18.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $137.5 million, suggesting a 50.5% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

275,51e6e906-27e0-3f19-8713-e8a8f454f158,COF,2023-05-23,Buffett Buys Stake in Capital One (COF): Should You Too?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buffett-buys-stake-capital-one-121300158.html,1684757580,STORY,['COF'],"[The revelation that Warren Buffett added Capital One COF to his portfolio during the first quarter resulted in the company’s share price rallying almost 10% last week. Per the data available in the latest 13-F, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway purchased nearly 9.92 million COF shares for more than $900 million.It is not surprising that Buffett invested in a consumer loan provider amid the ongoing regional banking crisis and heightened recession risk. He seems to be following one of his famous quotes “Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful.”Though Buffett purchased a stake in Capital One, he fully exited his stakes in a couple of banks and added more of his favorite bank – Bank of America BAC. Buffett has had BAC stock in his portfolio since 2017.So far this year, shares of Capital One have gained 5.3% compared with a 5.6% rally for the industry it belongs to.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s now try to understand what seems to have attracted Buffett to COF. A Deep Value PickValue investment style — choosing stocks with low multiples or assets trading below their intrinsic value — is a widely known investment plan and is broadly followed by Buffett.As for Capital One, its low multiples suggest that the stock is trading at a significant discount. A price-to-tangible book multiple of 0.94 compared with 9.98 for the broader market makes it one of the biggest steals in the finance sector. Hence, the heavily-discounted COF stock could become a deep-value investment in the long term.Also, the stock has a Value Score of B. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSolid Capital Deployment PlansDividend-paying stocks always attract investors as they act as a steady source of income and Capital One’s dividends and repurchase activities might have also encouraged Buffett’s position in the company. The bank has a dividend yield of 2.5%.The company has a share repurchase plan in place. In April 2022, COF announced an additional $5 billion worth of buyback program (effective from the third quarter of 2022), while in January 2022, it authorized a repurchase program of up to $5 billion. As of Mar 31, 2023, nearly $5 billion worth of repurchase authorization remained.Story continuesFundamentally SoundWhile the looming recession and macroeconomic uncertainty have led to bearish investor sentiments, Capital One seems well-poised to face any downturn.Let’s start with checking out the company’s liquidity position. As of Mar 31, 2023, almost 78% of Capital One’s deposits were insured. Being a consumer bank, there shouldn’t be much trouble brewing for the company related to huge deposit outflows. In fact, the company’s total deposits grew during the first quarter. Nonetheless, rising deposit costs will weigh on its financials in the near term.The next is Capital One’s asset quality. During the first quarter, domestic card net charge-offs (NCOs) increased to 4.04% from 2.12% in the prior-year quarter. Management noted that monthly NCOs will reach the pre-pandemic level by June this year. Further, the company built a reserve for loan losses by approximately $1.1 billion in the quarter. While the asset quality is expected to keep deteriorating this year as real income compresses and the unemployment rate moves up, COF has adequate reserves to cover losses on 7.6% of its credit card portfolio.The company also has a robust capital position, which will likely allow it to manage through some unforeseen events. Nonetheless, its earnings would take a hit because of this.Revenue growth remains a major positive for Capital One. Though revenues declined marginally in 2020, the same witnessed a five-year (2017-2022) CAGR of 4.7%. Prospects look encouraging on the back of the company’s solid credit card and online banking businesses, as well as decent loan demand and opportunistic acquisitions done in the past.ConclusionWe believe the strength in credit card and online banking operations, higher rates, modest loan growth, robust balance sheet position and strategic inorganic expansion efforts will aid Capital One’s profitability. Yet, one must keep an eye on headwinds, including weakness in asset quality and elevated expenses.While the concerns will likely dampen investor interest in the stock given the current operating backdrop, Buffett’s investment in the stock is likely to shift investors’ focus to Capital One’s long-term prospects.Capital One is not the only consumer loan provider in Buffett’s portfolio. Ally Financial ALLY has been part of his portfolio since last year. ALLY is predominantly an auto loan provider and currently has been facing almost similar macroeconomic issues as Capital One.At present, Capital One carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $54.57 billion, indicating growth of 3.8% from the prior-year reported figure.The bottom line of this Issaquah, WA-based company is anticipated to have improved year over year. Although the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share has declined 1.2% to $3.32 over the past 30 days, the figure still suggests an increase of 4.7% from the year-ago period.Costco has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.4%, on average. In the last reported quarter, the company’s bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.1%.Key Factors to NoteCostco’s growth strategies, better price management, decent membership trends and the increasing penetration of the e-commerce business have been contributing to its performance. The company’s strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped attract customers who have been seeking both value and convenience.The abovementioned factors have been aiding this operator of membership warehouses in registering a decent sales run. We estimate a 2.4% jump in net sales and a 6.5% rise in total membership fees for the quarter under discussion. No wonder, the company’s total paid members have been rising. Its growing customer base and high renewal rates have been fueling sales. We expect a 1.5% jump in comparable sales for the third quarter.Costco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseCostco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseCostco Wholesale Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Costco Wholesale Corporation QuoteHowever, our estimate suggests a sharp deceleration in the comparable sales growth rate on a sequential basis. This is because inflation and a high-interest rate environment have discomforted the family budget, compelling consumers to pull back on spending. We note that the metric had risen 5.2% in the second quarter.Further, margins also remain an area to watch. Any deleverage in the SG&amp;A rate, higher labor and occupancy costs, and increased marketing and other store-related expenses might have weighed on margins.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Costco this time.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ULTA in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $6.86 per share for ULTA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.81 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ULTA, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.66%  heading into earnings season.Ulta Beauty Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUlta Beauty Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUlta Beauty Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ulta Beauty Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that ULTA has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Ulta Beauty, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Many millionaires have been minted from beverage giants such as Coca-Cola and Monster Beverage, which both have incredibly robust business models, and tremendous stock returns.The Beverages-Soft drink industry currently sits in the top 10% of the Zacks industry rank, boosting near term expectations for the group. Additionally, over the last year, the soft drink industry has significantly outperformed the broad market, an impressive feat considering how challenging this period has been.Notably, Vita Coco Company, National Beverage and PepsiCo all boast high Zacks Ranks, further increasing the likelihood of near-term strength in the stock.National BeverageNational Beverage is best known for its flavored sparkling water drink La Croix, which has exploded in popularity over the last few years. Some of FIZZ’s lesser-known brands include Shasta, Faygo, Clear Fruit, and Big Shot Beverages. Its portfolio of products ranges from health-conscious options to more traditional carbonated soft drinks.Earnings estimates for FIZZ are being upgraded after experiencing significant revisions lower in the second half of last year. Q1 estimates have been revised 17% higher over the last two months, and FY23 earnings have been revised 9.7% higher. These strong positive revisions earn FIZZ a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).FIZZ stock has had a very strong 10-year performance, compounding at an annual rate of 22.8%, and outperforming the industry and broad market. However, over the last five years the stock has mostly stalled out and traded sideways.But, now with improving earnings expectations, and a large base to break out from, FIZZ’s next bull run could be starting imminently.Story continuesVita Coco CompanyVita Coco Company is a prominent beverage manufacturer known for its innovative and refreshing coconut water products. With a focus on health-conscious consumers, Vita Coco offers a range of natural and hydrating beverages that have gained widespread popularity in the market.COCO currently enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Analysts are in near unanimous agreement in upgrading COCO earnings estimates, with FY23 earnings being revised 4.7% higher, which would reflect a 191% YoY increase.COCO also expects strong and consistent sales growth over the coming years. Current quarter sales are expected to climb 14% YoY and FY23 sales are projected to expand 11.7% YoY.Vita Coco Company is a recent IPO, going public just 18 months ago. After getting caught up in the broad market weakness of 2022, COCO has surged higher in the last year. COCO stock has more than doubled since IPO, considerably outperforming the industry and market.PepsiCoPepsiCo has been unshakeable over the last 25 years, continually grinding higher unabated over that time.PEP has also outperformed its well-known rival Coca-Cola by a huge margin over the last two decades. So, while there is an ongoing debate with no clear winner regarding flavor, PEP is clearly the superior stock investment.Besides for the current quarter, which was downgraded by -4%, earnings estimates for PEP have been unanimously upgraded. Next quarter earnings are expected to show an 8.1% YoY increase, and FY23 earnings are projected to climb 7.5% YoY. PEP has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).PepsiCo is also a well-known dividend king, having raised its dividend for 50 years consecutively. Today, PEP provides a dividend yield of 2.4%, which has been increased by an average of 5.4% annually over the last 5 years.ConclusionBeverage companies can offer investors a range of different opportunities, from innovative new growth companies to historical dividend payers. As cheap indulgences, which consumers regularly buy during good times and bad, along wide margins, soft drink companies can make for exceptional investments.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

281,7c6b88b5-f3a9-3ca1-8d05-a546adb81b22,KO,2023-05-23,Is Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Using Too Much Debt?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-nyse-ko-using-130015106.html,1684760415,STORY,['KO'],"[David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola What Is Coca-Cola's Net Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of March 2023 Coca-Cola had US$43.9b of debt, an increase on US$42.1b, over one year. On the flip side, it has US$14.3b in cash leading to net debt of about US$29.6b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Coca-Cola's LiabilitiesThe latest balance sheet data shows that Coca-Cola had liabilities of US$23.4b due within a year, and liabilities of US$47.2b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$14.3b and US$4.60b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$51.6b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Given Coca-Cola has a humongous market capitalization of US$271.7b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.We'd say that Coca-Cola's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 2.2), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its commanding EBIT of 33.2 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. Notably Coca-Cola's EBIT was pretty flat over the last year. Ideally it can diminish its debt load by kick-starting earnings growth. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Coca-Cola's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last three years, Coca-Cola recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 84% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Our ViewCoca-Cola's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And the good news does not stop there, as its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow also supports that impression! Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that Coca-Cola takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Coca-Cola , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

282,37404baf-797e-3ec9-b959-13a05b1ba4e6,KO,2023-05-23,Investors Heavily Search CocaCola Company (The) (KO): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-cocacola-company-130013578.html,1684760413,STORY,"['KO', '^GSPC']","[Coca-Cola (KO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned -1.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which Coke falls in, has gained 3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.71 per share, indicating a change of +1.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.61 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.2%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.80 indicates a change of +7.3% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coke.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Coke, the consensus sales estimate of $11.68 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.2%. The $45.01 billion and $47.23 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.7% and +5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $10.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.7%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $0.64 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.87 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1%. The EPS surprise was +4.62%.Over the last four quarters, Coke surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

WM, Republic Services, Inc. RSG and Clean Harbors, Inc. CLH.Industry: Waste RemovalLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2098047/3-waste-removal-services-stocks-to-watch-amid-industry-challengesThe Zacks Waste Removal Services industry stands to benefit from the gradual resumption of business activities and reopening of the economy, which have led to increased waste production from industrial and commercial sectors. Government initiatives for sustainable waste management, increasing environmental awareness, rising population, rapid industrialization and urbanization, and growing adoption of advanced waste collection solutions are the other positives.Waste Management, Inc., Republic Services, Inc. and Clean Harbors, Inc. are some stocks likely to gain from the abovementioned factors.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Waste Removal Services industry comprises companies engaged in the collection, transportation, treatment, disposal, inspection and regulation of any form of waste. The companies serve residential, municipal, commercial and industrial customers in the United States and internationally.Some industry participants provide non-hazardous solid waste collection, transfer, recycling, disposal, and energy services for small-container, large-container, municipal and residential, and energy services customers in the United States and Puerto Rico, while others provide waste management environmental services to residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal customers in North America. Some industry players operate as environmental infrastructure and solutions companies, providing water handling and recycling solutions.What's Shaping the Future of the Waste Removal Services Industry?A Healthy Demand Environment: The industry is mature, with growth coming from volume and price increases. Income has grown steadily over the past few years, enabling most industry players to pursue acquisitions and other investments.Story continuesReopening of Economic Activities Bodes Well: With the reopening of the economy and the resumption of business activities, waste generation is bound to increase, especially in the industrial and commercial sectors. The proper disposal of medical waste will always remain an utmost priority to curb the spread of infection. Increase in population, industrialization and urbanization should remain the key drivers of the industry as it leads to a significant rise in garbage and recycling. Also, the use of advanced collection and recycling solutions are expected to pick up pace. This should enhance business opportunities for waste management companies.Government initiatives as well as stringent rules and regulations to advance sustainable waste management mechanisms and put a check on illegal dumping are also expected to boost the industry.High Operating Costs a Woe: Waste management is a time-consuming and complex process. It requires higher capital and operating costs to manage waste collection vehicles, bins, and processing equipment along with a huge number of workers. Such high operational expenses are likely to keep the bottom line of the companies in this industrial cohort under pressure.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy ProspectsThe Zacks Waste Removal Services industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #189. This rank places it in the bottom 25% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Despite the cloudy prospects, we present a few stocks that investors can buy or retain given their sturdy potential. But before that let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and its current valuation.Industry's PerformanceThe Zacks Waste Removal Services industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Business Services sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has gained 8.4% over this period against a 5.3% decline of the broader sector. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has risen 5.9% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), which is commonly used for valuing waste removal services stocks because of their high debt levels, the industry is currently trading at 14.39X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 12.69X and the sector’s 26.53X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 15.63X, as low as 8.57X and at the median of 11.97X.3 Waste Removal Services Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnWe are presenting three stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and are well-positioned to grow in the near term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Waste Management: Waste Management provides environmental solutions to residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal customers in the United States and Canada. WM’s top line has been benefiting from acquisition revenues and growth from yield. WM’s revenue growth for 2023 is expected to be between 4% and 5.5%, which includes organic revenue growth of nearly 5.5% from the collection and disposal business.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WM’s 2023 EPS has improved 0.5% in the past 90 days. WM stock has gained 5.4% so far this year.Republic Services: Republic Services offers environmental services in the United States. The positive impact of acquisitions and internal growth has been aiding RSG’s top-line growth. RSG is focused on increasing its operational efficiency by shifting to compressed natural gas collection vehicles and converting rear-loading trucks to automated-side loaders to reduce costs and improve profitability.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RSG’s 2023 EPS has improved 1.6% in the past 90 days. RSG stock has gained 12.5% so far this year.Clean Harbors: This Massachusetts-based company provides environmental and industrial services in the United States and internationally. Clean Harbors focuses on improving its efficiency and lowering operating costs through enhanced technology, process efficiencies and stringent cost management. It continues to make capital investments to enhance its service quality and comply with government and local regulations.Buyouts help the company expand its business across multiple lines of services. Consistency in rewarding shareholders through share buybacks boosts investor confidence and positively impacts earnings per share.For 2023, adjusted EBITDA is anticipated between $1.02 billion and $1.06 billion, up from the previous range of $1.01 billion and $1.05 billion. The rise reflects the company’s acquisition of Thompson Industrial Services.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CLH’s 2023 EPS has moved up 2.1% in the past 90 days. CLH stock has gained 21.5% so far this year.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

While tech stocks can be volatile, dietary and healthcare-related stocks often enjoy trends that last for years for several reasons. First, the aging demographics in the United States and around the world lead to a challenges and opportunities. Medical technology drug innovation advancements can spark multi-year growth trajectories for highly specialized med-tech companies such as Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFinally, consumers often change their dietary preferences based on new studies and scientific discoveries. Below are 3 stocks benefitting drastically from the current healthcare landscape.Trend: Rampant ObesityUnfortunately, the onset of processed foods and a more robust global economy in recent years has led to increasing levels of obesity and diabetes. Around 40% of the American population is obese. Though dietary changes and exercise are potential solutions, many cases of obesity have gone too far, or people are too lazy to adopt such changes. Enter Zacks Rank #1 stock Novo Nordisk (NVO). NVO is the leader in diabetes treatment – a space likely to see demand for years. Ozempic, the company’s blockbuster diabetes drug, is increasingly used for weight loss and diabetes treatments worldwide. Last quarter, earnings shot higher by 38% year-over-year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNVO’s beta of 0.48 means that the stock tends to be less volatile than the general market. Shares are etching out a bull flag pattern as they pull back to the 50-day moving average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrend: The Healthcare Industry’s Growth Over TimeStryker (SYK) is a medical device company benefitting from rising healthcare demand. Because healthcare is a non-negotiable, SYK is a stock more immune to economic downturns. Furthermore, the company has a diverse and wide-ranging product portfolio, so it is not dependent on one core product like many other med-tech firms. Stryker’s deep portfolio includes emergency medical equipment, surgical navigation systems, and implant products – to name a few.Story continuesStryker’s success is nothing new. Dating back to the early 1990’s, shares have been in one of strongest uptrends in the market, gaining some 8,800%. From a shorter-term perspective, shares are finding support at the 50-day moving average – a strong reward-to-risk zone where institutions tend to step in and buy shares.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrend: Increased Cardiovascular Disease CasesHeart disease is the number one cause of death for all sexes and racial backgrounds. According to the CDC, on average, one person dies every 33 seconds from cardiovascular disease in the United States. Shockwave Medical (SWAV) is a medical device company specializing in products to treat cardiovascular disease. Through its proprietary system, cardiologists have a means of delivering minimally invasive sonic pressure waves that treat calcified plaque. SWAV’s robust fundamentals are helping its underlying price and volume action. Year-to-date, shares of SWAV are higher by nearly 37%, while the company’s peer group is lower by 26%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBonus Trend: Healthy &amp; Environmentally Friendly Beverages.Though Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock Vita Coco (COCO) is not a healthcare stock, it benefits from strong dietary and taste preference trends. As the name implies, Vita Coco is one of the most popular coconut water brands. Coconut water has several health benefits. It can be consumed as an alternative to sugary sports drinks, as re-hydration, or as a natural energy enhancer. Beyond the many nutritional benefits, consumers are willing to pay a premium for Vita Coco’s products because of its sustainability, environmental friendliness, and all-natural ingredients.COCO is a member of the Beverage-Soft Drink industry group – a Zacks top 10% industry. From a fundamental perspective, the company has several things going for it. Last quarter, COCO beat earnings expectations by 50% as EPS shot higher by 200% and revenues increased by 14% year-over-year. Though the stock has moved up a lot in recent months, analysts remain bullish. Over the past 60 days, Zacks Consensus Estimates show that analysts are becoming more bullish on the company’s earnings going forward.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFrom a technical perspective, investors are getting a chance to purchase shares on a dip to support. Monday, shares dropped to the 50-day moving average for the first time since March after COCO announced a 4.5 million share secondary offering. Though shares were getting hit hard early, investors stepped in at the 50-day moving average to scoop up shares at a bargain. Investors can use the moving average as a trend guide moving forward.ConclusionBecause of their longevity, predictability, and stability, healthcare trends can often persist for years. The stocks mentioned above are fundamentally and technically robust stocks currently taking advantage of these trends. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company’s strong focus on opening new stores is also encouraging. Yet, National Vision’s high dependence on a limited number of vendors is a concern. Also, a tough competitive landscape is a threat. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).National Vision reported encouraging first-quarter 2023 results, with better-than-expected revenues. Amid an uncertain macro environment, the company delivered positive comparable sales growth in the first quarter, primarily driven by strength in its managed care business.  During the reported quarter, the company opened eight new stores. It ended the quarter with 1,357 stores. However, on a year-over-year basis, the company reported a significant decline in its earnings. The contraction of both margins on escalating expenses was discouraging too.During the quarter, National Vision opened four America's Best and four Eyeglass World stores, and closed five stores. For America's Best and Eyeglass World growth brands combined, unit growth increased 5% over the total store base last year. The company ended the quarter with 1,357 stores.Further, the company continues to roll out its remote care capabilities, which provide doctors with additional levels of flexibility and expand exam capacity in many areas. Per the company’s first-quarter update, it remains on track with its expansion into at least an additional 200 remote-enabled stores in 2023.National Vision Holdings, Inc. PriceNational Vision Holdings, Inc. PriceNational Vision Holdings, Inc. price | National Vision Holdings, Inc. QuoteNational Vision plans to continue executing its core growth initiatives and further investing in strengthening competitive advantages. In terms of store expansion, the company continues to see a sizable new opportunity with growth for many years to come. Despite many supply chain obstacles, during the first quarter, National Vision opened eight new stores and is on track to open nearly 65 to 70 new stores in 2023. The company noted that the new stores opened over the past 12 months continue to perform well and in line with the company’s expectations.Story continuesIn 2023, National Vision invested $27.7 million for capital expenditures, primarily focused on new store openings and customer-facing technology investments. In 2023, capex is expected in the range of $115 million to $120 million to support key growth initiatives.On the flip side, on a year-over-year basis, the company reported a significant decline in its earnings. The company’s gross margin contracted 45 basis points. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 9.3%. Adjusted operating margin contracted 158 bps year over year. Moreover, the company is facing demand headwinds across its network of stores, given the current macro environment, as well as the supply challenge, in a smaller subgroup of stores, due to the constraints in eye exam capacity. We note that National Vision operates in a highly competitive optical retail industry. The companies within the industry generally compete based on recognition of the brand name, price, convenience, selection, service and product quality. National Vision competes with national retailers like LensCrafters, Pearle Vision and Visionworks in the broader optical retail industry.Competition exists in physical retail locations along with e-commerce platforms. The company faces a competitive threat from online sellers of contact lenses and eyewear. A number of firms are focused on selling eyeglasses in the online market like Warby Parker and Zenni Optical.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Addus Homecare Corporation ADUS, Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI and Davita Inc DVA.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Addus Homecare’s 2023 earnings indicates 10.9% year-over-year growth.

The company announced that its TactiFlex Ablation Catheter, Sensor Enabled has received FDA approval for treating people with abnormal heart rhythms like atrial fibrillation (AFib). The company claims this catheter to be the world’s first ablation catheter with a flexible tip and contact force technology.The latest approval broadens the company’s electrophysiology business line.In February, the company had received European CE Mark for TactiFlex Ablation Catheter, Sensor Enabled. This catheter is also approved for use in Japan, Africa and Australia.More on the NewsPatients with AFib often feel dizziness, chest pain and heart palpitations. AFib can even lead to stroke if left untreated. From a medical perspective, it is always better to address the issue as fast as possible.AFib is currently claimed to be the most common abnormal heart rhythm.Abbott noted that using TactiFlex catheters can reduce procedure times and provide better safety compared to the company's previous-generation catheters.The TactiFlex catheter is designed to be used together with Abbott's EnSite X EP System.  EnSite X is the company’s advanced heart mapping system enabling physicians to view and precisely identify areas in the heart that require ablation.How TactiFlex is Superior to Other CathetersAccording to Abbott, unlike other available catheters, the TactiFlex catheter is facilitated by a tip design with a laser-cut pattern. It flexes when in contact with the heart wall. This helps in directing fluid to the treated tissue, allowing more accurate positioning of the catheter. This in turn provides up to two-times higher stability in a beating heart, crucial for consistent therapy delivery.In this regard, the company noted that the TactiFlex catheter generated strong clinical outcomes in the TactiFlex AF IDE study with more than 99% acute procedural success.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHuge Market Prospect for TactiFlexPer data provided by Abbott, over 37 million people globally live with AFib and this figure is expected to more than double by 2050. Further, an additional five million cases are diagnosed every year, indicating a growing health challenge requiring cutting-edge solutions.In such a situation, we believe the latest regulatory approval in the United States is well-timed and strategic.Latest DevelopmentAbbott’s last-reported first quarter of 2023 organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing, increased 10%, led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) and Nutrition. Within EPD, sales increased 11% in the quarter led by strong performance in Brazil, China, and Southeast Asia and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, gastroenterology, CNS and pain management.Within Nutrition, sales increased more than 10%. In the United States, pediatric nutrition growth of more than 35% was driven by favorable year-over-year comparisons (lower sales in the first quarter of 2022 were due to a voluntary recall of certain infant formula products).Within Diagnostics, excluding COVID testing, organic sales growth was led by mid to high single-digit growth in Core Lab, Rapid and Point of Care Diagnostics. Despite dull sales in China, Core Lab Diagnostics sales showed year-over-year improvement led by strong performance in the United States and Europe.Within Medical Devices, sales grew 12.5% globally on an organic basis, including mid-teens growth in the United States and double-digit growth internationally. In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter, including approximately 50% growth in the United States and mid-teens growth internationally.Share Price PerformanceOver the past year, Abbott has been outperforming the industry it belongs to.

HOLX recently announced the receipt of the FDA 501(k) approval for its Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay. The multiplexed respiratory test is available in the United States with new RespDirect collection kit.Hologic has sent more than 200 million SARS-CoV-2 laboratory diagnostic tests around the world since the COVID epidemic started. Following the July 2022 news of the CE certification for the same test in Europe, the FDA's approval of the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay strengthens Hologic's position as one of the biggest molecular diagnostic firms in the world.The latest development will likely bolster Hologic’s Molecular Diagnostics business.More on Panther Fusion AssayThe Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay is done using the fully-automated, high-throughput Panther Fusion system, which can process more than 1,000 tests in a 24-hour period and gives preliminary results in about three hours.This system's adaptability, combined with Hologic's respiratory virus menu, provides a variety of testing possibilities from a single sample and enables laboratories and healthcare practitioners to tailor patient testing depending on medical history and regional prevalence.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis assay is a molecular diagnostic test that distinguishes between the four most common respiratory viruses, including the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A, influenza B and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Benefits of the Panther Fusion AssayThe Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay debuts with the new RespDirectTM collection kit, which enables laboratories to directly load samples for processing on the Panther Fusion system without any uncapping or specimen transfer steps, saving time and lowering the risk of error, repetitive stress injuries and virus exposure.A number of respiratory infections, including COVID, the flu and RSV, circulated concurrently throughout communities this past winter and frequently displayed identical symptoms, making diagnostics challenging. Per Hologic’s management, the Panther Fusion assay will be a vital tool in assisting doctors in figuring out, which respiratory virus or coinfection patients are carrying that will help them decide on the best course of therapy.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer Grand View Research, the global respiratory disease testing/diagnostics market size was valued at $5.0 billion in 2016 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.3% by 2025. The rising rate of pollutants in the air and the release of hazardous gases causing lung diseases including COPD and other respiratory diseases around the world is driving the market.Progress Within Molecular Diagnostics BusinessIn Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics continues to register strong growth during fiscal second quarter. The growth was driven by BVCVTV vaginitis panel and aided by the core STI menu, including Clemidiagonrhia, HPV and Trich. The company witnessed strong contributions from Biotheranostics and respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion during the quarter.The company’s expanded global installed base of Panthers, over 3,250 strong represents the catalyst for the division's sustained growth. The superior workflow of the Panther combined with a broad menu of nearly 20 FDA-approved assays across the Panther and Panther Fusion systems, creates tremendous value for customers and differentiates us from competitors.Price PerformanceIn the past year, Hologic’s shares inched up 3.4% compared with the industry’s fall of 2.4%.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksHologic currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Addus Homecare Corporation ADUS, Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

The stock hit a new 52-week high of $227.84 in the previous session. VeriSign has gained 10.7% since the start of the year compared to the 27.1% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 15.5% return for the Zacks Internet - Software and Services industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 27, 2023, VeriSign reported EPS of $1.7 versus consensus estimate of $1.64.For the current fiscal year, VeriSign is expected to post earnings of $6.92 per share on $1.49 billion in revenues. This represents a 10.9% change in EPS on a 4.88% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $7.68 per share on $1.62 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.98% and 8.54%, respectively.Valuation MetricsVeriSign may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.VeriSign has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 32.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 29X.

And there's no denying that this is the most profitable strategy. But making sure of the sustainability of a trend to profit from it is easier said than done.Often, the direction of a stock's price movement reverses quickly after taking a position in it, making investors incur a short-term capital loss. So, it's important to ensure that there are enough factors -- such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. -- that could keep the momentum in the stock going.Investors looking to make a profit from stocks that are currently on the move may find our ""Recent Price Strength"" screen pretty useful. This predefined screen comes handy in spotting stocks that are on an uptrend backed by strength in their fundamentals, and trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness.VeriSign (VRSN) is one of the several suitable candidates that passed through the screen. Here are the key reasons why it could be a profitable bet for ""trend"" investors.A solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. VRSN is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 14.6% over this period.However, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 4.5% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this internet infrastructure services provider.Moreover, VRSN is currently trading at 99.4% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout.Looking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Another factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 (Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price performance.So, the price trend in VRSN may not reverse anytime soon.In addition to VRSN, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our ""Recent Price Strength"" screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Ingersoll Rand Inc. IR, AGCO Corporation AGCO and Tetra Tech, Inc. TTEK.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:How to Choose Winning Stocks in Any Kind of MarketThere are many factors to consider before selecting a stock. There are also differing reasons for investment, differing investment horizons and different risk appetites. However, no matter what these differences may be, there are certain characteristics/hallmarks of a stock that may be considered a good investment. These include:Strong financials: A company with strong financials is more likely to be able to weather economic downturns and continue to grow its business. Therefore, companies with a history of profitability, positive cash flow and low debt levels are the obvious choice.Growing market: The market or industry of which it is a part is a very important consideration. A company that is operating in a growing market, or in a market that is seeing strong demand, is more likely to see its sales and profits increase over time. Conversely, when the operating climate for a company is not conducive to growth, the company is unlikely to do as well.Competitive advantage: A company with a competitive advantage is more likely to be able to outperform its competitors and generate above-average profits. Patents, trademarks or other unique assets generally give companies an edge over their rivals.Strong management team: An experienced management team is usually behind every successful company. They are the ones that take the important decisions to position the company for success with a focus on innovation, building on its competitive strengths and implementing a suitable marketing strategy.Story continuesReasonable valuation: A stock that is trading at a reasonable valuation is more likely to provide a good return on investment. Although growth stocks often trade at elevated valuations because of the promise of future potential, these stocks are, as a rule, riskier.With these points in mind, here are a few stocks that are worth adding to your portfolio today:Ingersoll Rand Inc.Davidson, North Carolina-based Ingersoll is a company that provides mission-critical technologies in air, fluid, energy, specialty vehicles, and medical sectors. The company operates through two segments: Industrial Technologies and Services and Precision and Science Technologies.The Industrial Technologies and Services segment offers air and gas compression, vacuum and blower products, as well as fluid transfer equipment, power tools and lifting equipment under various brand names. The Precision and Science Technologies segment focuses on designing and manufacturing pumps, gas boosters, compression systems, automated liquid handling systems and other related components for specialized applications in various industries. Ingersoll Rand sells its products through a network of direct sales representatives and independent distributors.The company has been growing its earnings and cash flows since the pandemic lows and also paying down its debt. The current debt level is very manageable.Ingersoll is part of the Manufacturing - General Industrial market, which according to the Zacks ranking system is in the top 11% of Zacks-classified industries, thus supporting growth.A company’s market position and management efficiency show up in its performance and analyst confidence in these may be seen in estimate revisions. In the case of Ingersoll, we’re seeing 11.5% revenue growth and 13.1% earnings growth estimated for this year. For 2024, growth rates are expected to come down to a respective 3.6% and 7.2%. Estimates for 2023 and 2024 are up 5.1% and 5.9%, respectively in the last 30 days.IR shares are trading at a slight discount to their median level over the past year. Therefore, the shares are worth buying. The shares carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).AGCO CorporationDuluth, Georgia-based AGCO is a global manufacturer and distributor of agricultural equipment and replacement parts. The company offers a wide range of products, including horsepower tractors for various agricultural operations, utility tractors for small- and medium-sized farms, compact tractors for specialized uses, grain storage and handling equipment, seed-processing systems, feed storage and delivery systems for swine and poultry, and equipment for egg and broiler production.AGCO also provides a variety of harvesting and packaging equipment for vegetative feeds, as well as implements for soil preparation, planting and cultivation. The company sells its products under multiple brands through a network of independent dealers and distributors worldwide.AGCO has been growing its earnings and cash flows in the last few years. Its current debt level is very reasonable.The company belongs to the Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry, also in the top 11% of Zacks-classified industries.For AGCO, analysts are projecting 15.1% revenue growth and 17.7% earnings growth this year. The probability of a recession next year is likely prompting the 1.04% expected revenue growth and 0.08% expected earnings decline next year. However, sentiments appear to be improving, as seen from the 8.1% increase in the 2023 estimate and 5.2% increase in the 2024 estimate in the last 30 days.AGCO generally trades at a discount to the S&amp;P 500. Currently it is also trading at a 14.9% discount to its median level over the past year, suggesting upside potential. Zacks has a #1 rank (Strong Buy) on the shares.Tetra Tech, Inc.Pasadena, California-based Tetra Tech is a global company that offers consulting and engineering services. It operates through two segments: the Government Services Group (GSG) and the Commercial/International Services Group (CIG). The GSG segment provides services such as data collection, monitoring, analysis, engineering design, project management and operations and maintenance for government clients. It also offers climate change and energy management consulting.The CIG segment provides similar services to clients in natural resources, energy, utilities and sustainable infrastructure markets. Tetra Tech serves a wide range of sectors, including water resources, environmental monitoring, waste management, and civil infrastructure planning.In the last quarter, Tetra Tech closed the acquisition of London-based RPS group. With a workforce of 5,000 employees spread across the UK, Europe, Asia Pacific and North America, RPS specializes in providing consulting and engineering solutions for complex projects primarily in the energy transformation, water management, program management and data analytics markets.As a result, its debt balance soared. But since its pre-acquisition debt was so low, even post-acquisition, the debt level remains in a reasonable range. Its profitability and cash flows remain strong.The company belongs to the Pollution Control industry, which is in the top 32% of industries, still a relatively strong position for growth.Analysts are every optimistic about Tetra Tech’s prospects in the years ending September 2023 and 2024. Revenue for the two years is currently projected to increase a respective 27.8% and 12.5%. Earnings are expected to increase 13.8% and 22.1%, respectively. The estimate for the current year is up 10 cents (2.0%) and for next year, is up 25 cents (4.2%).TTEK shares have almost always traded a at a premium to the S&amp;P 500. What is more significant however is that it is currently trading at a 14.7% discount to its median level over the past year, suggesting upside. Additionally, Zacks has a #1 rank on the shares.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

SoCalGas' ASPIRE 2045 sustainability strategy also closely aligns with Sempra's key sustainability pillars: enabling the energy transition, driving resilient operations, championing people, and achieving world-class safety.""Every Californian deserves a clean, affordable, safe, and resilient energy future and our ASPIRE 2045 sustainability strategy sets the path to achieve that future through innovation, collaboration and decarbonization,"" says Jawaad Malik, chief strategy, and sustainability officer at SoCalGas. ""Over the last year, our progress continues to drive better business outcomes, create new opportunities for our skilled employees, and build stronger and more resilient communities across our service territory.""Enabling the Energy TransitionIn support of enabling the energy transition, SoCalGas announced its proposal to develop Angeles Link, an energy transportation infrastructure system that could deliver reliable clean renewable hydrogen to the Los Angeles Basin for use in heavy-duty transportation, industrial processes, electric generation and other ""hard-to-electrify"" sectors of the Southern California economy.Additionally, SoCalGas unveiled the [H2] Innovation Experience that is constructed to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum standards and demonstrates how a renewable hydrogen microgrid can provide a resilient and reliable source of power. This technology could allow neighborhoods to operate independently from electric grids that may subject customers to power loss or interruptions in service on days when grid reliability is compromised by heatwaves, wildfires, rain, persistent cloud cover, and other types of severe weather or equipment failure.Story continues""As we work toward achieving California's ambitious clean energy goals, SoCalGas' forward-thinking solutions, at scale and in collaboration with state and federal partners, offer real promise on paving the way for the essential role clean energy sources like hydrogen will play in meeting future energy demand,"" says Senator Josh Newman (D-Fullerton). ""As we make the necessary plans and investments in the infrastructure for a clean energy economy, innovative solutions like the ones under development at SoCalGas can breathe new life into existing infrastructure systems, helping our state decarbonize affordably while providing Californians the energy supply necessary to power one of the world's largest and most dynamic economies.""In 2022, SoCalGas also became the first gas-only utility in the U.S. to issue green bonds in a public offering. Following Sempra's Sustainable Financing Framework, SoCalGas raised $600 million in bonds to support specified projects within its sustainability initiatives. The net proceeds from the fixed-rate green bonds will finance and/or refinance sustainability investments in pollution prevention and control, green buildings, and clean transportation.Driving Resilient OperationsAn effort that both enables the energy transition and drives resilient operations is SoCalGas' investments in leak detection technologies, which meaningfully advance methane emissions reductions. SoCalGas reduced methane emissions by 37% through 2021 – exceeding the state's goal of a 20% reduction by 2025 and nearing the state's goal of a 40% reduction by 2030.Additionally, as of the end of 2022, 36% of the company's over-the-road fleet are alternative fuel vehicles. The company has an interim goal to convert 50% of its fleet to zero emissions vehicles by 2025 and aims to reach 100% zero emissions vehicles by 2035. SoCalGas is also using renewable power from the grid at eligible facilities, underscoring its aim to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in its operations and delivery of energy by 2045.Championing PeopleSoCalGas aims to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace and in the communities it serves. In 2022, SoCalGas purchased over $1 billion or nearly 43% of all goods and services, from minority, women, service-disabled veteran, and LGBT owned businesses, collaborating with 578 diverse businesses in total, with the majority of those firms based in California.""SoCalGas' investments are vital to the health and longevity of our local communities their guidance provides clarity to the everyday obstacles that underserved small businesses face,"" says Gene Hale, chairman for the Greater Los Angeles African Chamber of Commerce. ""We are grateful for the resources, assistance, and pathway to long term economic success that SoCalGas provides which are essential for a sustainable future.""SoCalGas also partners with organizations like the Utility Workers Union of America to train veterans and invests in community grant programs that provide underserved populations with technical trainings and customer service skills. As part of SoCalGas' Equity Action Plan, the company launched Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which are voluntary, employee-led groups that fosters diversity and inclusion, professional development support, and a sense of community.Achieve World Class SafetySoCalGas describes its pipeline fiber optic technology pilot program, which demonstrates how monitoring the environment to detect changes in temperature, movement and sound can provide early detection, mitigation, and prevention of potential damage to pipeline infrastructure, while enhancing public safety, especially for the workers who operate and maintain it.Read the full 2022 Corporate Sustainability Report here.

294,9fb0b6b7-42c0-34a9-9165-98f459cb3b9b,GE,2023-05-23,Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-general-electric-110027176.html,1684839627,STORY,['GE'],"[Key InsightsGeneral Electric's estimated fair value is US$115 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityWith US$105 share price, General Electric appears to be trading close to its estimated fair valueOur fair value estimate is 5.4% higher than General Electric's analyst price target of US$109How far off is General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric Is General Electric Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.07bUS$5.74bUS$6.87bUS$8.22bUS$8.72bUS$9.11bUS$9.45bUS$9.76bUS$10.0bUS$10.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.47%Est @ 3.76%Est @ 3.27%Est @ 2.92%Est @ 2.68% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% US$3.8kUS$4.9kUS$5.4kUS$5.9kUS$5.8kUS$5.6kUS$5.4kUS$5.1kUS$4.8kUS$4.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$51bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$10b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.5%– 2.1%) = US$166bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$166b÷ ( 1 + 8.5%)10= US$74bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$125b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$105, the company appears about fair value at a 8.7% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at General Electric as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.070. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for General ElectricStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Industrials market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued.

The Optum health benefits services unit, which accounts for approximately 45% of the company's operating earnings, in our view, has the potential to grow even further as customers look for ways to manage rising healthcare costs. During the period, shares detracted from performance due to several factors: 1) many 2022 healthcare winners with shorter duration profiles and persistent earnings profiles, such as UnitedHealth Group. underperformed in the first quarter of 2023, 2) uncertainty surrounding Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels from the Federal government in 2023, which will be determined later in the year, and 3) increased regulatory scrutiny in the form of potential Medicare Advantage audits across the industry.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$13.6bUS$15.4bUS$16.8bUS$17.7bUS$18.5bUS$19.1bUS$19.7bUS$20.2bUS$20.7bUS$21.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.41%Est @ 3.02%Est @ 2.75%Est @ 2.56%Est @ 2.42% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$12.8kUS$13.5kUS$13.8kUS$13.6kUS$13.2kUS$12.8kUS$12.4kUS$11.9kUS$11.4kUS$10.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$126bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$21b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$456bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$456b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$235bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$361b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$153, the company appears about fair value at a 0.02% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Procter &amp; Gamble as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Procter &amp; GambleStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Household Products market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Procter &amp; Gamble, we've compiled three additional factors you should look at:Risks: For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Procter &amp; Gamble  that you should be aware of.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for PG's future outlook?

It will offer luxury valet service and other high-end amenities and design features.The introduction of Élephante to MAC’s Scottsdale Fashion Square, which is currently undergoing redevelopment, is part of the latter’s current project to extend the property's luxury presentation into the south wing anchored by Nordstrom to meet market demand.Per Doug Healey, senior executive vice president of Leasing, Macerich, “We are very pleased to welcome the Wish You Were Here Group and Élephante to our top-performing Scottsdale Fashion Square. Unique, upscale experiential restaurant concepts like Élephante continue to differentiate Macerich's A+ property in Arizona and further cement its place as one of the top luxury retail destinations in the entire country.”Macerich has a portfolio of premium assets in the United States, with a notable presence in California, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona and the Metro New York to Washington, DC corridor. These properties are located in densely populated areas, where affluent consumers with significant disposable incomes live and play, offering the company solid scope to generate decent cash flows.The increase in consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences following the pandemic downtime has driven the recovery in the retail real estate industry. Retailers continue to rent out more physical store spaces to meet this growing demand.As a result, retail REITs, including Macerich, are expected to experience a rise in leasing activity and pricing power, and flourish.Earlier this year, the company welcomed Chinese restaurant Din Tai Fung to Santa Monica Place, and fashion retailer — Zara — and Irish retail brand — Primark — to Queens Center in New York City.In first-quarter 2023, MAC signed 256 leases encompassing 949,000 square feet. On a comparable center basis, this reflected a 59% increase in the amount of square footage leased and a 20% rise in the number of deals signed year over year.MAC is also making concerted redevelopment efforts to boost the quality of its retail properties, drive more footfall and lure tenants. In January 2023, it announced that its Santa Monica Place will house the first U.S. flagship location for global art and technology phenomenon ARTE MUSEUM, replacing the former ArcLight Cinemas site.Nonetheless, higher e-commerce adoption and rising interest rates are key concerns for Macerich.  Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 9.9% in the quarter-to-date period compared with its industry's decline of 3.7%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Iron Mountain IRM, Rexford Industrial Realty REXR and Stag Industrial STAG, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

MAR, BorgWarner Inc. BWA, D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI, América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. AMX and Triton International Ltd. TRTN.5 Stocks with High ROE to Buy as Debt Ceiling Crisis LingersThe U.S. equity markets witnessed immense volatility in the past couple of trading days as the debt ceiling crisis lingered, with negotiators failing to reach a consensus. The market remained mostly on tenterhooks as a failure to lift the debt ceiling will likely trigger a default, leading to chaos in the financial markets and a spike in interest rates. The impasse rattled investors to such an extent that even a dovish statement from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell (that interest rates might not need to rise as much as expected given the tight credit conditions from the banking crisis) failed to improve the market sentiments.A weaker-than-expected wholesale prices data – often considered a sign of easing inflation – further failed to ease the concerns of a downturn. Wholesale prices rose just 0.2% in April compared with wide expectations of a 0.3% rise. The consumer price index increased 0.4% in April, equating to a 4.9% annual inflation rate – the lowest reading since April 2021. However, continued financial market stress and uncertain business conditions amid a looming debt crisis remained an overhang.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Marriott International, Inc., BorgWarner Inc., D.R. Horton, Inc., América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. and Triton International Ltd. are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Story continuesWhy ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screen:Marriott: Headquartered in Bethesda, MD, Marriott is a leading worldwide hospitality company focused on lodging management and franchising.

In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screen:Marriott: Headquartered in Bethesda, MD, Marriott is a leading worldwide hospitality company focused on lodging management and franchising.

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ORLY for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?O'Reilly Automotive's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at O'Reilly Automotive's main business drivers.O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. is a leading specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States. Founded in 1957, O'Reilly’s initially operated from a single store in Springfield, MO. The company’s stores offer several services and programs to customers, which include battery diagnostic testing, check engine light code extraction and loaner tool program, among others. The products offered by the company stores are vehicle accessories, such as floor mats and seat cover as well as maintenance items like antifreeze, engine additives, filters, fluids, lighting and wiper blades. Besides these, it provides new as well as remanufactured automotive hard parts like alternators, batteries, brake system components, belts, chassis parts, driveline parts, engine parts and fuel pumps.The company sells products to both Do-it-Yourself (DIY) customers and Do-it-for-Me (DIFM) or professional installers. It sells an extensive line of products consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts (such as mufflers, brakes and shock absorbers), maintenance items, accessories, a complete range of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service equipment. The company has a track record of over 40 years of following a dual-market strategy by serving both DIY and DIFM customers and is among the top three companies in both the markets.Story continuesThe automotive aftermarket items industry is a highly competitive industry. O'Reilly’s presence in the market, customer service, product availability, store location, brand recognition price and store location position the company in a competitive position in the market among peers in the industry. The company’s omnichannel growth strategies are focused on offering customers an enhanced and seamless shopping experience through variety of digital and physical channels. The auto retailer has been expanding its physical presence through opening or acquiring stores while maintaining the existing ones. As of Dec 31, 2022, O’Reilly’s total store count was 5,971.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in O'Reilly Automotive ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2013 would be worth $8,601.17, or a 760.12% gain, as of May 22, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 151.40% and gold's return of 39.18% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for ORLY.O’Reilly has been generating record revenues since 30 consecutive years on the back of growth in auto parts market. For 2023, O’Reilly projects total revenues within $15.2-$15.5 billion, up from $14.41 billion generated in 2022. It is poised to benefit from store openings and distribution centers in profitable regions. O’Reilly’s diverse product portfolio catering to DIY and DIFM customers are driving comps growth. Mayasa Auto Parts buyout, O’Reilly’s first international expansion transaction, bolstered growth prospects. But rising SG&amp;A costs led by store expansion and omni-channel goals are hurting margins. Distribution, labor and logistic bottlenecks are weighing down the firm’s prospects. High debts levels also play a spoilsport.  Thus the stock warrants a cautious stance now.The stock has jumped 5.59% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 13 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It may not have been easy to hold on to ETN for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Eaton's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Eaton's main business drivers.Dublin, Ireland-based Eaton Corporation plc is a diversified power management company and a global technology leader in electrical components and systems. It sells products in more than 175 countries and has 92,000 employees. The company was founded in 1916.Eaton’s current reportable segments post closure of the Hydraulics segment on Aug 2, 2021 are Electrical Americas, Electrical Global, Aerospace, Vehicle and eMobility.The Electrical Americas segment includes sales contracts that are primarily for electrical and industrial components, power distribution and assemblies, residential products, single and three-phase power quality, wiring devices, circuit protection, utility power distribution, power reliability equipment, as well as services that are primarily produced and sold in North and South America. The Electrical Global segment consists of the same activities as mentioned in Electrical Americas but are primarily produced and sold outside of North and South America.Vehicle segment includes the company's erstwhile truck and automotive segments. The truck segment designs, manufactures and markets powertrain systems and other components for commercial vehicle markets. Aerospace segment is a supplier of aerospace fuel, hydraulic and pneumatic systems for commercial and military use.The eMobility segment focus on two technologies within electrical vehicles, namely Power electronics &amp; conversion and Power distribution &amp; circuit protection.Eaton's segments — Electrical Americas, Electrical Global, Aerospace, Vehicle and eMobility — contributed 41%, 28.2%, 14.6%, 13.6% and 2.6%, respectively to 2022 revenues.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Eaton ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2013 would be worth $2,604.70, or a 160.47% gain, as of May 22, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 151.40% and gold's return of 39.18% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for ETN too.Eaton’s first-quarter earnings and sales were better than expected. ETN’s consistent research and development investments allowed it to develop products for providing efficient power management solutions. Eaton operates in a number of markets and the quality products supplied by Eaton enable it to retain a strong market position. The company is also expanding business via acquisitions and rising backlogs further boost its performance. Eaton's strategy to manufacture in the zone of sale has helped it reduce costs. Its shares have outperformed the industry in the past year. Yet, ETN’s global operations expose it to unpredictable currency translation, changes in tax rates, and security breaches, which might impact operations. The shortage of raw materials and supplier insolvencies might impact production and operations.The stock is up 6.92% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 7 higher, for fiscal 2023.

311,7c4959fd-29bb-3c5a-908f-5bb50af96077,AWK,2023-05-23,4 Water Utility Stocks to Watch in a Promising Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-water-utility-stocks-watch-154800148.html,1684770480,STORY,"['SJW', 'CWCO', 'AWK']","[Water utilities work day in and day out to ensure an uninterrupted supply of clean potable water and reliable sewer services to millions of customers in the United States. These are essential for healthy and hygienic living.The aging of pipelines is concerning but water utilities continue with their upgrade and maintenance projects to minimize disruptions in operations. American Water Works Company AWK, with its widespread operations, provides services to domestic customers and military bases and offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the water utility space. Other utilities worth retaining in one’s portfolio are Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. CWCO, Global Water Resources Inc. GWRS and SJW Group SJW.About the IndustryThe Zacks Utility - Water Supply industry includes companies providing drinking water and wastewater services to industrial, commercial, residential customer classes and numerous military bases. Water utility operators own nearly 2.2 million miles of pipelines that are getting old. Utilities continuously replace old pipelines and add new ones to expand operations. Utility operators own storage tanks, treatment plants and desalination plants to supply uninterrupted potable water across customer classes. High per capita usage and increasing population are resulting in higher demand for potable water and water utilities, apart from necessitating proper maintenance and upgrade of aging infrastructure to supply water, utilize technology to treat saline water and make it fit for consumption.3 Trends Pivotal for Shaping the Water Supply Industry's FutureFragmented Water Industry Needs Consolidation:  Since the U.S. water utility industry is highly fragmented, upgrading aging assets to provide quality services is the need of the hour. Per the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), at present, 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems in the United States are providing water solutions to customers. Per the ASCE finding, due to the delay in pipeline repairs and maintenance, 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost every day in the United States. The highly fragmented industry creates operational challenges in meeting the requirement for replacement, and adding to the aging water and wastewater infrastructure. Large water utility companies continue to acquire small companies to ensure the extension of high-quality services to customers and the investment required to upgrade old and acquired assets. Water conservation and initiatives taken by large water operators in educating their consumers on efficient use of appliances and detecting leakage should help to prevent wastage.Aging Infrastructure Needs Huge Investments: The water and wastewater infrastructure is aging and gradually nearing the end of its effective service life. Per the findings of the ASCE, water main breaks occur every two minutes in the United States due to the aging of the existing water infrastructure. It is evident that this industry needs more investment for maintenance and upgrade. Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), an estimated $744-billion investment is necessary to maintain and expand the drinking water and wastewater service to meet demand over the next 20 years. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $50 billion to EPA to strengthen the drinking water and wastewater systems of the United States. A major portion of the investment will be directed to upgrading water infrastructure serving disadvantaged communities.Story continuesEfficient Use is Saving Precious Water: An interesting trend in the water industry is the reduction in per-capita water usage. The reasons for the drop are the use of water-efficient techniques, heightened awareness among customers courtesy of the water utilities, the use of advanced water-efficient appliances and actions taken to fix pipeline leaks. Efficiency in water usage in irrigation for farming and lower water usage in thermoelectric power due to better cooling methods reduce water usage. Lower use per person allows water utilities to meet the need of an expanding customer base without increasing capacity to a great extent. In a way, efficient usage and a reduction in wastage allow water utilities to keep their service rates unchanged for a longer period for consumers and assist water utility operators in increasing their earnings by serving a larger population with the same water supply capacity.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Utility Water Supply industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Zacks Utilities sector.

The educational effort is part of the company's Lead Service Line Replacement Program aimed at replacing all lead and galvanized water service lines by 2031 as mandated by state law.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230522005488/en/""Replacing all lead and galvanized water service lines by 2031 is a top priority. The first step in accomplishing this goal, in the most efficient and cost-effective way, is to know where they are so we can remove them in a coordinated method, street-by-street and town-by-town,"" said Mark McDonough, President, New Jersey American Water. ""By educating and empowering our customers to participate in this easy way, we can help accelerate the program more expeditiously than the law’s 2031 deadline.""New Jersey American Water is asking their customers to help support the effort by locating and identifying their water service line and submitting a survey with their findings. This can be done in three easy steps and using simple household items such as a magnet and a coin to identify the material of the water service line. The instructions on how to identify your line – including a video tutorial – and a special portal to submit your findings can be found here.Starting this week, customers with unknown service line material listed in New Jersey American Water’s published inventory will begin to see information about the campaign through emails from the company, on social media, and in targeted digital, cable and outdoor advertising.Story continuesAs part of the program, New Jersey American Water continues to replace lead and galvanized service lines where other infrastructure projects are occurring, as well as based on the prioritization plan for the company’s 30 public water systems that scores communities’ census tracts by health risk factors. The combination of the education campaign and prioritization plan, as well as partnering closely with municipal officials will allow the company to continue to improve the initiative to mitigate costs over the span of the program.""We look forward to partnering with our customers, municipalities and other key stakeholders within the communities we serve over the coming months and years to work together towards this goal of replacing all lead service lines statewide once and for all,"" stated McDonough.In July 2021, New Jersey enacted legislation requiring all water providers to replace both utility-owned and customer-owned lead and galvanized service lines by 2031. But customer-owned water service lines have historically not been tracked by water utilities, so completing an inventory of customer-owned service lines is a necessary step to replacing all lead or galvanized water service lines.It is important to note that if your service lines contain lead, it does not mean you cannot use water as you normally do. New Jersey American Water regularly tests for lead in drinking water and the water delivered to customers meets state and federal water quality regulations, including those set for lead.Launched shortly after Infrastructure Week - which raises awareness about the importance of infrastructure investment and modernization - the customer education effort and the Lead Service Line Replacement Program also represents New Jersey American Water’s commitment to investing in its infrastructure.

313,6c476c64-3ba0-342c-aa5e-ee903dfcb0e6,FCX,2023-05-23,13 Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-basic-materials-stocks-142618866.html,1684765578,STORY,"['APD', 'RIO', 'FCX', 'SCCO', 'VALE', 'NUE', 'LIN', 'NEM', 'BHP', 'PPG']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 13 best basic materials stocks to buy now. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Now.The basic materials industry is huge and includes major segments like oil, metals &amp; mining, chemicals, and other raw materials. The industry often remains in flux amid changing oil and commodity prices. Oil companies account for a major chunk of the basic materials industry. Major oil stocks like ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum are trading in the red this year amid fears of a slowing economy and recession. This lackluster performance of oil companies comes after a huge outperformance of the energy sector last year.Pessimism Around ChinaThe biggest factor that is denting the performance of many energy and commodities companies this year is the pessimism surrounding Chinese economic growth. Earlier this year the market cheered the reopening of China. The world was expecting the demand for commodities to surge as Chinese factories and industries fire up. But the economic growth in China remains slower than expected.For April, China’s indicator of manufacturing activity declined to 49.2 from the previous month’s 51.9 reading. On April 25, copper prices fell to their five-week lows after data indicated a slower-than-expected rebound in activity in China and rising inventors at the London Metal Exchange warehouse system.Talking about the reopening dynamics in China and how it’s affecting iron ore, steel prices and related business of the company, Vale’s management said the following in its latest earnings call:""So we’ve been seeing the recovery in China. Definitely we have strong numbers. You mentioned that GDP FAI very resilient, infrastructure investment properties, we have good news also. So the bright side that we are in the stocking mall in China. So, we see the sales increasing also the accomplishment of construction also increase. You mentioned all the micro numbers, blast furnace going well, we just came from China. It’s a common sense that production will be flat this year. So the production is there. So what is concerning today, so, the first thing is related to property. It is a cycle. So we firstly we need to sell, finish the construction. So land sales and new starts are coming.So that didn’t come yet. So that’s the main volatility that we see in our — even in our clients. They are in a wait and see mode. But everybody’s waiting that for only for the second half. So we are on track and we need to wait for that. I think price in steel, it’s another concern. But the good news is, if you see the export that you had in China, this quarter. That implies that we have a symmetry in the price, ex-China comparing to China. So there is a wind that can help China to improve the price in the steel market. And as a combination of all of this, we have a tepid or really tepid margins steel mill. So with all this, we have this wait and see behavior, we have old inventors are really low. So in our perspective in short-term, we can see a rebound, we have this next holiday that is coming out and they will need to replenish the supply chain.""Story continuesBut as the Federal Reserve mulls a pause on rate hikes, the economy might get back to normal, giving a boost to the materials sector. In December, Goldman Sachs predicted that commodities could give investors over 40% returns in 2023. The firm at the time said that it was expecting the first quarter to be “bumpy” for the sector amid weakness in China and the US. However, the firm was expecting the sector to benefit from the shortage of commodities after the first quarter.Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Shane Cottle on UnsplashMethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked 13 basic materials stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

So that was part of the impact. The other thing you would see in silicones was that, pricing and demand held up relatively well. Some pressure downward on siloxanes pricing in China from new capacity additions there. But I think we’re starting to see that the demand is picking up and that should help smooth things out. So you also saw higher net sales in coatings and monomers and also higher volumes. Some of its supply availability, as I mentioned in silicones and siloxanes, the other is getting ready for seasonally higher volumes going into the second quarter.And then we think we’ll see more of a traditional seasonal pickup in the coatings and monomers segment. Some pressure on architectural coatings, but industrial coatings are looking relatively strong. And I think we’ll have to watch carefully what’s going on with housing starts and housing sales and see how that impacts architectural coatings through the quarter."" Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested articles:10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Fast Food Stocks to Invest In15 Most Tax-Friendly Countries in EuropeDisclosure: None. 13 Best Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(FCX) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-mcmoran-inc-fcx-trending-130007489.html,1684760407,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this mining company have returned -9.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, which Freeport-McMoRan falls in, has lost 14.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.50 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -13.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.06 points to a change of -15.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.30 indicates a change of +11.8% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Freeport-McMoRan.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for FCX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.99 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $23.92 billion and $24.11 billion estimates indicate +5% and +0.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryFreeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5.39 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -18.4%. EPS of $0.52 for the same period compares with $1.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.07%. The EPS surprise was +10.64%.Over the last four quarters, Freeport-McMoRan surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Freeport-McMoRan is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Cisco, Inc. CSCO, Philip Morris International Inc. PM, BCE Inc. BCE and Ameriprise Financial, Inc. AMP.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top Research Reports for NVIDIA, Cisco and Philip MorrisThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation, Cisco, Inc. and Philip Morris International Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;NVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+89.9% vs. +42.4%). The company is gaining from strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute &amp; Networking revenues. The stock was up big following the last quarterly release on February 22nd and Nvidia fans will be hoping for a repeat perforance it comes out with quarterly numbers this coming Wednesday (May 24th).A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.However, NVDA’s near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and data center chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Cisco have modestly outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past year (+16.1% vs. +15.5%). The company’s end-to-end security is benefiting from strong demand for Cisco’s unified threat management and zero trust offerings.Cisco witnessed strong demand for its products, including the Catalyst 9000 family, Meraki, and Nexus 9000 offerings. Expanding growth opportunities for low-power-consuming technologies, including IoT, Silicon One and Power over Ethernet bodes well for Cisco. Its investments across security business, focusing on cloud-based offerings, is expected to drive growth in the long haul.Cisco now expects modest revenue growth in fourth quarter. Earnings is expected to grow at a higher rate than revenues driven by gross margin expansion and disciplined expense management.(You can read the full research report on Cisco here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Philip Morris have declined -1.9% over the past six months against the Zacks Tobacco industry’s decline of -4.5%. The company has been battling cost-related headwinds and expects certain margin pressures in the first half of 2023. Also, soft cigarette shipment volumes and volatile currency movements have been concerns. In 2023, the total international industry volume is estimated to decline by 1-2%, excluding China and United States.Nevertheless, Philip Morris has been gaining from its pricing power. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance in the first quarter of 2023 and is likely to drive performance in the full year.A focus on reduced risk products, especially IQOS, has been working well for the company, which is witnessing a continued product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products. These upsides are likely to boost organic revenues in 2023.(You can read the full research report on Philip Morris here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include BCE Inc. and Ameriprise Financial, Inc.Story continuesWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

GPS is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2023 numbers on May 25.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first-quarter bottom line is pegged at a loss of 17 cents per share, suggesting 61.4% growth from the prior-year quarter’s actual. The consensus estimate for the fiscal first-quarter loss has widened by a penny in the past seven days. For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $3.3 billion, indicating a 5.4% decline from that reported in the year-ago quarter.In the last reported quarter, Gap’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 27.1%. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 905.7%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.The Gap, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  The Gap, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Gap, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteGap has long been gaining from continued momentum across its Athleta brand. The Athleta brand’s value-driven active and lifestyle categories, increased digital marketing investments, and focus on product strategy have been aiding sales. Increased focus on performance active, as well as active lifestyle products to capitalize on the evolving shopping trends, bodes well.The company has been aggressively undertaking cost-management actions, which are expected to have improved its performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Some notable efforts were increasing spans of control and decreasing management layers to improve the quality and speed of decision-making, as well as creating a consistent organizational structure across all four brands.Gap has been on track with the execution of its Power Plan 2023, which focuses on opening highly profitable Old Navy and Athleta stores, while closing the underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores. As part of the plan, the company expects the Old Navy and Athleta brands to contribute about 70% of sales by 2023.In its last earnings report, GPS expected year-over-year gross margin expansions for the fiscal first quarter, in line with our estimate. SG&amp;A expenses were predicted to be $1.2 billion in the fiscal first quarter compared with our estimate of $1.29 billion.However, Gap has been reeling under inflationary pressure and drab demand. In its last earnings report, management expected first-quarter fiscal 2023 sales to decline in the mid-single-digit range, whereas it reported $3.5 billion in the prior-year quarter. Also, rising prices of essential commodities are likely to have hurt lower-income consumers' spending on non-essentials like apparel.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Gap this season.

GPS, may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Gap is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for GPS in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 15 cents per share for GPS, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 17 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for GPS, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +9.48%  heading into earnings season.The Gap, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThe Gap, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThe Gap, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Gap, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that GPS has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Gap, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But don't give up.As leaders we are not only responsible for delivering business outcomes but ensuring that our team culture supports and accelerates them. As the leader of Cisco Innovation Labs, diversity of thought, inclusion, and belonging all unlock my team's potential to challenge the status quo, design, and innovate.So why practice inclusive language? Simply put, to bring your team together. We may never truly know people's histories, and what you consider unimportant may be a barrier to progress for another person. Using language that builds a positive relationship rather than a wall brings your team together for the jobs to be done-the ones for which you are ultimately accountable. According to a study in Harvard Business Review, people at high-trust companies report 74% less stress, 106% more energy at work, 50% higher productivity than people at low-trust companies.Language has more power than we realize - it can break down barriers and bring teams together, but it can also erode credibility, stifle ideas, and isolate your team. When it comes to demanding and fast-paced environments, this risk increases, and we compromise our opportunity to innovate.Your words and actions matter.""What leaders say and do makes up to a 70 percent difference as to whether an individual reports feeling included"" - Harvard Business ReviewYou may not realize how much your language choices are appreciated until after you put them into practice.For example, I try to include my pronouns whenever I introduce myself. After I started doing this, a few colleagues shared that this created a more welcoming space for them to do the same and bring their whole selves to work. According to BCG'S BLISS report, ""employees who can be their authentic selves are happier, more motivated to give their best, feel like their perspectives matter-and are nearly 2.4 times less likely to quit.""Story continuesAnother practice I've started is to be approachable when communicating around inclusive language during meetings. If I realize I've said something that could be potentially harmful, I'll pause and ask those on the call if what I said was non-inclusive. Then I'll rephrase what I said. Again, I receive ongoing feedback from team members on how much this openness is appreciated.When I'm transparent with my active practice of inclusive language, I find others doing the same. By leading by example, it takes away the perception that this is hard work and slows things down, because we are adjusting for inclusion in real time.There are several categories of language I'd like to point out. Cisco's policy addresses harmful race-related terms that we often find in code, but that's just the start:Race. Common examples are master and slave. Another is blacklist and whitelist. I'll expand on this to say that any time you see colors being used as descriptors, especially if certain colors indicate good or bad, then avoid using them.Gender. I already mentioned the ""hey guys"" example, but that can be expanded to include ""bro,"" ""man,"" and ""dude."" Historically, our language included many career roles with ""man"" creating a default barrier to talent such as fireman, handy man, chairman, etc.Ability and Disability. This includes terms like ""handicapped"" or using medical conditions in a derogatory way (e.g., ""I'm so ADHD today,"" ""crazy,"" ""mental,"" ""psycho,"" ""OCD"" ""crippled me,"" and ""blind spot"").Idioms and acronyms: Spell out your acronyms. When you assume that your audience knows the product line and terminology to the point of understanding industry acronyms, you end up excluding someone.Violent language. Many times, people use violent words in a business context. This is something I'm trying to focus on correcting too. ""Killing the presentation,"" ""pull the trigger,"" or ""create a battle plan"". Figure 1 offers suggestions to move away from violent language.The ""Fire-able Offense"" list. These are words you should never use because they constitute harassment or fire-able offenses. These should be universally understood as ""never say.""As you notice your word choices and practice finding inclusive language replacements, it will become easier. Here are some specific suggestions to start implementing for yourself and your team:Focus on your business objectives. What business problem are you trying to solve and who is your ultimate audience or customer? How can inclusive communication accelerate your outcome?Coach your team. For your team, observe the type of language being used. If you hear violent language referring to business activities, you can ask if they need to use those specific words and suggest alternatives.Give feedback the way you'd prefer to hear it. Be empathetic and relatable when you give feedback. Unless it's truly a team issue, approach people individually to explain your perspective and listen to their point of view. Give them quick, easy fixes to start. Always have alternatives ready-don't simply tell someone that they used harmful words.Catch people doing things right. Encourage and support your team and their development. Celebrate them when you catch them using inclusive language or pull them aside to share your feedback.Find a buddy for practice. Find a friend or trusted coworker to talk through your own examples and help you practice using more inclusive language. Be sure it's a safe space with someone you trust to be vulnerable and learn!To sum up, incorporating inclusive language into my work and everyday life has helped me become a stronger leader. It's made me more aware, effective, and empathetic, which has led to better outcomes for myself and my team, and our overall organization.The following links are some resources you can explore to further your awareness and education about inclusive language. Remember - it's about progress through practice, not perfection!InclusiveNaming.org list: Provides tiered lists of terms recommended for more inclusive speech.The Haas School of Business Center of Equity, Gender, and Leadership's Framework: An exceptional guide that provides context behind inclusive language and guidelines for evaluating your word choices.Cisco's commitment to an Inclusive FutureView original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/756315/Cisco-Inclusive-Leadership-via-Language]"
