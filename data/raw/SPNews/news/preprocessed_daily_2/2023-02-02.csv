The annual survey ranks the world’s largest companies based on attributes related to corporate reputation and financial performance.Schwab ranked second in the Securities and Asset Management category, with a top rank for innovation, use of corporate assets, quality of management and quality of products/services.""I am grateful to all of our Schwabbies for their unwavering commitment to championing every client’s goals with passion and integrity – especially during a momentous year when we look to welcome Ameritrade clients to Schwab,"" said Schwab Co-Chairman and CEO Walt Bettinger. ""Recognition like this is a direct result of their commitment to building trust and loyalty with all our clients by serving them as we ourselves would expect to be served and delighting every client - of every size - every time they engage with us.""Schwab’s focus on creating a culture of service, inclusion and seeing challenges ""Through Clients' Eyes"" has also resulted in the company’s recognition as a top place to work in markets where it has a business presence. In 2022, and among other accolades, Schwab was included on Forbes’ listings of best large employers and best employers for new graduates, veterans, and women; named a best place to work for disability inclusion by the Disability Equality Index; and recognized as a best place to work for LGBTQ+ Equality by the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index for the 18th year in a row.MethodologyFortune collaborated with Korn Ferry on this survey of corporate reputation, beginning with a universe of about 1,500 candidates: the 1,000 largest U.S. companies ranked by revenue, along with non-U.S. companies in Fortune’s Global 500 database that have revenues of $10 billion or more. Fortune winnowed the assortment to the highest-revenue companies in each industry, a total of 645 in 27 countries. The top-rated companies were picked from that pool of 645; the executives who voted work at the companies in that group.Story continuesTo determine the best-regarded companies in 52 industries, Korn Ferry asked executives, directors, and analysts to rate enterprises in their own industry on nine criteria, from investment value and quality of management and products to social responsibility and ability to attract talent. A company’s score must rank in the top half of its industry survey to be listed. (For complete rankings, visit fortune.com.)To select the 50 All-Stars, Korn Ferry asked 3,760 executives, directors, and securities analysts who had responded to the industry surveys to select the 10 companies they admired most. They chose from a list made up of the companies that ranked in the top 25% in last year’s surveys, plus those that finished in the top 20% of their industry. Anyone could vote for any company in any industry.The difference in the voting rolls explains why some results can seem at odds with each other.About Charles SchwabThe Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) is a leading provider of financial services, with 33.8 million active brokerage accounts, 2.4 million corporate retirement plan participants, 1.7 million banking accounts, and $7.05 trillion in client assets.

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) share price is up 86% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 54% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 6.7% in the last year , including dividends .After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Texas Instruments achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 21% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Texas Instruments has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Texas Instruments will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Texas Instruments' TSR for the last 5 years was 113%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Texas Instruments shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 6.7% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, that falls short of the 16% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN), Enbridge Inc. (ENB) and Fiserv, Inc. (FISV). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Texas Instruments have underperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (-5.7% vs. -23.4%). The company is facing sluggishness in the Analog segment remains a concern. Further, weakening momentum across personal electronics and industrial end-markets is a negative. Additionally, pandemic-led supply-chain disruptions and imposition of new export regulations are headwinds.However, Texas Instruments fourth quarter results were driven by solid momentum across its Embedded Processing segment. Growing demand for embedded technologies across the automotive and industrial markets contributed well.Additionally, continued rebound in the automotive market was a tailwind. We note that the company’s growing investments in new growth avenues and competitive advantages remain tailwinds. Further, its portfolio of long-lived products and efficient manufacturing strategies are other positives.(You can read the full research report on Texas Instruments here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Enbridge have underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines industry over the past year (-4.9% vs. +1.7%). The company has significant debt exposure since there has been a weakness in its operations. Also, it has mostly been yielding lower dividends than the industry over the past year.  As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.However, Enbridge has the longest and most sophisticated oil and liquids pipeline system in the world, which spreads across 17,809 miles. Hence, a significant portion of the midstream operator’s earnings is generated from transportation operations, driven by a string of long-term contracts.Enbridge increased its annualized common share dividend to C$3.55 per share, thereby marking a dividend hike for 28 straight years. The leading midstream company expects to put more than C$13 billion growth projects into service in 2024 and beyond. This is expected to generate significant EBITDA growth in the coming years.(You can read the full research report on Enbridge here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Fiserv have declined -1.5% over the past year against the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry’s decline of -10.7%. The company is facing stiff competition which makes it a difficult task for strong and long-term client relationships. Acquisition of a large number of companies results in some integration risk. Fiserv has more long-term debt outstanding than cash.However, Fiserv enjoys a dominant position in the financial and payments solutions business on the back of broad and diverse customer base, and continued technology upgrades. FISV's diversified product portfolio helps attract a steady flow of customers.Acquisitions help expand its product portfolio, enhance offerings, boost its market share and customer base. The company has been consistently rewarding shareholders through share buybacks. These initiatives instill investors’ confidence, positively impacting earnings per share.(You can read the full research report on Finserv here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include UBS Group AG (UBS), State Street Corp.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.STMicroelectronics has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that STM's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.STM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.68, while TXN has a forward P/E of 23.38. We also note that STM has a PEG ratio of 2.34. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TXN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.51.Another notable valuation metric for STM is its P/B ratio of 3.36. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TXN has a P/B of 11.03.These metrics, and several others, help STM earn a Value grade of A, while TXN has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesSTM stands above TXN thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that STM is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Welcome to the Western Digital Fiscal Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Presently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. . And as a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.Peter Andrew: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including expectations for our product portfolio, cost reductions, business plans and performance, demand and market trends and financial results based on management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.David Goeckeler: Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our 2023 second quarter results. The Western Digital team worked diligently within a dynamic market and delivered revenue at the high end of the guidance range we provided in October. We reported second quarter revenue of $3.1 billion and non-GAAP operating loss of $119 million. Our non-GAAP loss per share was $0.42. Our ongoing efforts to control expenses, optimize working capital and deploy capital judiciously helped us manage cash flow amidst a challenging flash pricing environment and larger-than-expected ACD underutilization that pressured gross margins. Before we discuss the details of our second quarter results, I wanted to cover two other announcements that we are making today.Story continuesFirst, we disclosed that Western Digital has entered into agreements with Apollo Global Management and Elliott Investment Management for convertible preferred equity investments totaling $900 million. In connection with the agreement, Reed Raymond, a partner at Apollo, will join our Board starting immediately. On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to welcome Reed, a leading technology investor who will provide us with additional financial and strategic expertise, which will be critical as we continue to execute on our business strategy and complete our strategic review. Second, on January 25, we secured access to $875 million of financing through a delayed draw term loan. When combined with the actions we undertook to structurally lower our cost structure, these financings provide valuable financial optionality and flexibility to Western Digital as we continue our strategic review.Regardless of the outcome of the strategic review, our goal is to ensure the business is in a solid financial position to invest in innovation and create long-term shareholder value. Given the ongoing nature and confidentiality of the process, we will not be answering any questions about the strategic review process or making comments on market rumors. We will provide updates as we have them. Over the past three years, we have worked continuously to reinvigorate innovation and bolster business agility for both our flash and HDD organizations, which enabled the Western Digital team to stay ahead of the market. Over the same period, we paid down $2.7 billion in debt and arranged for settlement of a long-standing tax dispute. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2023, we have taken additional actions to reset the business in response to the post-pandemic environment.These actions include: first, we have further reduced our capital expenditures across Flash and HDD to moderate our supply. As a result, our projected cash capital expenditure for fiscal 2023 has declined nearly 40% from six months ago. Second, we have decreased supply bid growth across both Flash and HDD. In Flash, we reduced wafer starts by 30% in January. In HDD, during the fiscal first quarter, we consolidated production lines across our manufacturing facilities and idled certain media production lines in Asia, reducing client hard drive capacity by approximately 40%. During the fiscal second quarter, we continued to optimize our capacity enterprise manufacturing footprint to align our supply with the new demand environment. Third, we have reduced our quarterly non-GAAP operating expense by over $100 million since the close of fiscal year 2022, driven by lower headcount, discretionary spending and variable compensation.We are targeting to reduce quarterly non-GAAP operating expense level to below $600 million by the time we exit the fiscal year. And lastly, in December, we successfully executed an amendment to the existing financial covenants under our credit agreement. Turning to end market demand during the fiscal second quarter. Demand for consumer-oriented products stabilized as we discussed in October. In Consumer, we experienced a seasonal uptick across both Flash and HDD. In client, channel demand for both SSD and HDD have improved. However, commercial PCs are now being impacted by tightening budgets and spending across corporations, which is negatively affecting client SSD shipments. In cloud, we experienced a decline in nearline shipments as our customers were undergoing inventory digestion and ongoing subdued China demand.I'll now turn to business updates, starting with HDD. During the fiscal second quarter, our HDD revenue declined significantly as cloud inventory digestion intensified, while demand for retail and client HDD improved. We continue to successfully execute on our product road map as we completed qualifications and commenced shipments of our latest generation 22-terabyte CMR hard drives at multiple cloud and major OEM customers last quarter. We are aggressively ramping this 22 terabyte CMR product this quarter and expect this drive along with its SMR variants to be our growth engine going forward. Qualifications of our 26 terabyte UltraSMR drives are also progressing well. Our major customers remain committed to adopting SMR drives as the 20% capacity gain that UltraSMR drives over CMR offers multi-generation TCO benefits to the most complex data centers worldwide.We expect sequential growth in revenue and margin into our fiscal third quarter and continued recovery as we move through calendar year 2023. Turning to Flash. Thanks to our broad portfolio, diverse routes to market and leading retail franchise combined with strong seasonal demand, bit shipments increased 20% sequentially, exceeding our forecast. While we continue to experience pricing pressure in the market, our premium brands, including SanDisk, SanDisk Professional and WD_BLACK continued to deliver strong share and profitability to support the business. Our premium WD_BLACK client SSD, which is optimized for gaming continues to be well received in the marketplace. It achieved a record exabyte shipments, unit shipments and average capacity per drive resulting in exabyte shipment increase of 73% sequentially and 41% year-over-year for this product.On the technology front, BiCS5 represented 70% of our flash revenue in the December quarter, while BiCS6 will reach cost crossover in the fiscal third quarter. Our next-generation 3D NAND node BiCS8 has entered productization phase. BiCS8 incorporates several groundbreaking 3D NAND architectural innovations to deliver a major leap in performance and cost-effective solutions to a broad range of exciting products, demonstrating the benefits of Western Digital's strong partnership with Kioxia and our innovation leadership in 3D NAND architecture. As we look into the fiscal third quarter, in hard drives, overall demand in cloud has stabilized, and we expect modest improvement in near line to offset a seasonal decline in client and consumer hard drives.We expect stronger improvements in the second half of this calendar year, led by the aggressive ramp of our 22 and 26 terabyte hard drives. In flash, we expect enterprise SSD product demand for the fiscal third quarter to be sharply reduced as certain large cloud customers have entered a digestion period. In addition, a reduction in commercial PC demand is expected to impact client SSD shipments in the near term. Driven by the lower customer demand forecast in enterprise and client SSDs, we anticipate bit shipments to decline in the fiscal third quarter and return to growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, Western Digital lowered wafer starts in January, and we remain flexible in adjusting the magnitude and duration to restore our flash supply and demand balance.As noted, for calendar year 2023, we expect reduced capital investment and lower utilization in response to the new demand environment. Our initial estimate is for flash demand bit growth to be in the low 20% range with production bit growth to be well below that of demand. With that, let me turn the call over to Wissam, who will discuss our second quarter results in greater detail and provide an outlook for the third quarter.Wissam Jabre: Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.1 billion, down 17% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.42. Looking at our end markets, cloud represented 39% of revenue at $1.2 billion, down 33% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Sequentially, the declines in capacity enterprise drives sold to our cloud customers and smart videos were partly offset by an increase in Flash shipments. Nearline bit shipments were 61 exabytes, down sequentially, driven by inventory digestion. The year-over-year decline was also primarily due to inventory digestion in hard drives. Client represented 35% of total revenue at $1.1 billion, down 11% sequentially and 41% year-over-year.Sequentially, the decline was driven by pricing pressure across our Flash products, which was partly offset by an increase in hard drive shipments. The year-over-year decline was also due to pricing pressure in Flash as well as lower client SSD shipments for PC applications. Finally, consumer represented 26% of revenue at $0.8 billion, up 17% sequentially and down 25% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was driven by a seasonal uptick in both retail hard drives and Flash shipments. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower retail hard drive shipments and pricing pressure in Flash. Turning now to revenue by segment. We reported HDD revenue of $1.5 billion down 28% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 35% and average price per hard drive decreased 21% to $99.On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 33%, and average price per unit increased 2%. Flash revenue was $1.7 billion, down 4% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs were down 20% on a blended basis and 13% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 20% sequentially and remained approximately flat year-over-year. As we move to costs and expenses, please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal second quarter was 17.4%, down 9.3 percentage points sequentially and 16.2 percentage points year-over-year. Our HDD gross margin was 20.7%, down 7.8 percentage points sequentially and 9.9 percentage points year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the decline was due to underutilization related charges of approximately $100 million.Our Flash gross margin was 14.5%, down 10 percentage points sequentially and 21.6 percentage points year-over-year. We are continuing to reduce our costs with operating expenses at $659 million for the quarter, down $30 million sequentially. Operating loss was $119 million. Taxes were a benefit of $48 million. Taxes are influenced by several factors, including the projected quarterly profitability for the rest of the year and our corporate tax structure. Earnings per share was a loss of $0.42. operating cash flow for the second quarter was $35 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $240 million. Cash capital expenditure which includes the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on our cash flow statement was $275 million.Our gross debt outstanding remained at $7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter. Our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA at the end of the second quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $3.3 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.1 times compared to 1.5 times a year ago. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.8 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the Flash Ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. As David mentioned, during the fiscal second quarter, we executed an amendment to the credit agreement that temporarily increased the covenant leverage ratio for the next seven quarters.Our liquidity position continues to be strong. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a revolver capacity of $2.25 billion for total liquidity of $4.1 billion. Today, we announced multiple agreements to further enhance our liquidity position by $1.8 billion as follows. On January 25, we closed the delayed draw term loan agreement with our lenders in the amount of $875 million. In addition, as David mentioned, Western Digital entered into an agreement with Apollo Global Management and Elliott Investment Management for a convertible preferred investment of $900 million. Together, these actions significantly increase our ability to access liquidity and provide additional financial flexibility and optionality as we manage through this challenging downturn and execute on our strategic review.Before I go over guidance for the fiscal third quarter, I'll discuss the business outlook and the financial impact associated with the actions we are taking to rightsize our cost structure. In HDD, we expect revenue to increase modestly in the fiscal third quarter as growth in nearline shipments outpaces decline in consumer. In Flash, we expect both shipments and ASP to decrease sequentially. We expect bit growth to resume in the fiscal fourth quarter. For the fiscal year 2023, we are reducing our gross capital expenditures to approximately $2.3 billion compared to our prior forecast of $3.2 billion entering this fiscal year. We are also aiming to reduce our cash capital expenditure to $900 million which is about 40% below our forecast six months ago.The primary drivers of our lower capital expenditures are the delay of the BiCS6 transition in flash and reduced investment levels in both client and capacity enterprise hard drive manufacturing. We have reduced our quarterly operating expenses by over $100 million compared to six months ago. We are targeting to exit this fiscal year with quarterly operating expenses below $600 million. These actions will allow us to weather this cycle while also enabling us to continue advancing our innovative product road map going forward. I'll now turn to guidance. For the fiscal third quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 9% and 11%, which includes underutilization charges in Flash and HDD totaling $250 million, with Flash driven by a 30% reduction in wafer starts.We expect operating expenses to be between $600 million and $620 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $90 million. We expect tax expenses to be between $60 million and $70 million for the fiscal third quarter and approximately $240 million to $260 million for the fiscal year. We expect loss per share of $1.70 to $1.40 in the third quarter, assuming approximately 319 million shares outstanding. I will now turn the call back over to David.David Goeckeler: Thanks, Wissam. Before we open up for questions, I wanted to reiterate our view of the long-term opportunities for both Flash and HDD storage. Importantly, our efforts have enabled us to regain architectural leadership in both Flash and HDD, and we are preparing these technologies to address the meaningful long-term growth for data storage from client to edge to cloud. With our diverse portfolio, broad go-to-market engine, an enviable retail franchise and a lower cost structure, we remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term shareholder value. Okay.

The company had reported earnings of $2.30 per share in the prior-year quarter.The performance was affected by challenging flash pricing environment and higher-than-expected ACD underutilization charges which pressured margins, noted Western Digital.However, revenues of $3.107 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.1%.The top line decreased 36% year over year. The decline was owing to weak performance across all segments. On a sequential basis, revenues decreased 17%.The company also announced that it has entered into agreement with Apollo Global Management and Elliott Investment Management for convertible preferred equity investments deal worth $900 million. WDC added that the investment will aid the company in executing its ongoing strategic review process while managing economic downturn.Per a report by Bloomberg earlier this year, Western Digital and Japan-based Kioxia are carrying out advanced talks for a probable merger.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFollowing the announcement, shares were down 4.8% in the premarket trading on Feb 1.

On a sequential basis, cloud revenues were down 33%.Revenues from the Client end market (35% of total revenues) were down 41% year over year and declined 11% sequentially to $1.089 billion. The downtick was caused by lower flash pricing on a year-over-year basis and reduced client SSD shipments for PC applications.Story continuesRevenues from the Consumer end market (26% of total revenues) were down 25% year over year but up 17% sequentially to $794 million. Sequential performance was driven by seasonal increase in demand for both retail hard drives and flash.Considering revenues by product group, HDD revenues (47% of total revenues) decreased 34% year over year to $1.45 billion. The downtick was mainly caused by cloud inventory digestion which offset improvement in demand for retail and client HDD solutions.

Western Digital is falling despite getting a $900 million investment in preferable stock from Apollo Global Management and Elliott Management. The preferred stock will have a conversion rate of $47.75 a share here. You're seeing shares move lower by about 3 and 3/4%, but even with that, the quarter wasn't great for Western Digital as well.JULIE HYMAN: No, I mean anything that is sort of touched by PCs right now is not doing great. They make NAND, NAND flash memory. And so that seems to be what's to blame here, that people are overweighting the quarter. I mean, also, it's not a straight investment from Apollo and Elliott if this convertible preferred stock means at some point, when it converts back to shares, that it'll dilute value for existing shareholders. So maybe that's a problem, too.BRIAN SOZZI: And of course, as we should mention, Apollo is the parent company of Yahoo Finance. Also, Western Digital getting a new board member, Reed Raymond.

The top line declined primarily due to lower sales in the Hawthorne segment resulting from the weakness in the hydroponic industry.Company-wide gross margin rate (as adjusted) was 18.2% compared with 21% in the year-ago quarter. The decline in gross margin is attributable to unfavorable fixed cost leverage related to volume loss at Hawthorne, increased commodity costs and reduced production volumes in the U.S. consumer business.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.Joel Marcus: Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody. With me today, are Hallie Kuhn, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga. Want to thank you for joining Alexandria's fourth quarter and yearend 2022 earnings call and wishing you a safe and healthy new year. And thank you to our Alexandria family team members for their continued operational excellence across all facets of our unique business platform. A truly mission-driven, one-of-a-kind company. We have truly exceptional fourth quarter and 2022 yearend results and by any and all metrics, we're very proud, thankful, and humbled, while many public recording companies ever really struggled mightily during this past year. I'd like to take a moment to tick off what I consider to be some of the most notable news for Alexandria.Truly amazing that Alexandria has delivered approximately 8.5% FFO per share earnings growth while continuing to strengthen our fortress balance sheet, the strongest in our history and Dean will give you more details on that. Against the backdrop of a very deleterious macro-market in this 2022 year and really again, nothing short of operational excellence to the team. With our highly leased development pipeline and continued strong leasing and Peter will comment on that, Alexandria is well positioned to deliver strong earnings growth again in 2023. We have continued to create long-term shareholder value with a total shareholder return from IPO through the end of this -- end of the year, December 31, 2022 of 1673% compared to the MSCI read index of 684%, S&amp;P 500 of 628% and NASDAQ 838%.Story continuesSo a wide margin upbeat. Alexandria continues to produce stable, increasing, long duration cash flows and an increasing dividend. We're very proud of our approximately 1,000 client tenant base, a one of a kind treasurer that continues to generate remarkable demand for our Alexandria lab space and Peter and Dean will highlight more on this, but again, two million square feet leased in fourth quarter, over eight million for the year and almost 18 million for the last two years with rental rate increases last year of about 22% on a cash basis. Pretty amazing stats and we're very proud of our own tenant base, which is generated by far and away the majority of that lease space. 4Q '22 and yearend 2022 was another strong quarter by all fundamental financial metrics and a few others and Dean will highlight some of this, almost 100% -- almost a 100% on collections from a very strong and durable tenant base and very proud of almost 95% occupancy and we put in I think very strong same-store performance both for the quarter and the year.Innovation in medicine is but must continue to be a national imperative. One in four of us will develop a neurodegenerative disease. Nearly 40% of adult men and women will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes. One in five in the nation's population suffers from mental illness and we're continuing to see over a 100,000 deaths due to overdose last year, despite all of the efforts that certainly this company has made with our Dayton project, but just a literally a war out there, which does not seem to be in check and governments at the federal, state and local level need to double down with the vast amount of resources that have been appropriated over the last few years and really focus on this mental health issue. A comment about our successful and continuing value harvesting and recycling of our precious capital, Peter will detail that, but amazingly stellar 2022 with $2.2 billion successfully harvested and then reinvested in a highly disciplined, disciplined manner and Peter and Dean will also comment on the excellent and steady progress we've made year to date, just one month in to our 2023 business plan for value harvesting and capital recycling and we're very optimistic about that.And then before I pass it over to Hallie, want to particularly call out and thank our particularly call out and thank our finance team and all those who had a hand in the impressive balance sheet accomplishment set forth on Page XB of our supplement. I am very proud that we once again have the strongest balance sheet in the company's history. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Hallie for further comments.Hallie Kuhn: Thank you, Joel and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of science and technology and capital markets. Today, I'm going to provide a recap of the life science industry coming out of 2022 and now into 2023 and how our highly unique approximately a 1,000 tenants remain resilient through the volatility of the current macroeconomic environment. As Joel mentioned, and as we often talk about, the 90% of 10,000 diseases remains an incredible opportunity and unmet need. And the fact is, many of these that do have treatments are far from solved. Take type 1 diabetes. While it was a death sentence before the discovery of insulin over 100 years ago, it still carries an immense burden. A person with type 1 diabetes makes on average 180 health-related decisions a day, some of which have life or death consequences.Now looking back at 2022, the stats truly speak for themselves regarding the enduring strength of the life science industry, of which I'll highlight 3. First, despite widespread commentary that VC funding hit the pause button in 2022, life science venture deals totaled nearly $58 billion. Other than 2021's record year, it was the second highest amount of capital ever deployed. Of note, over 70% of VC dollars deployed went into an Alexandria cluster, and with VC funds across tech and life science raising nearly $160 billion in 2022, a record eclipsing 2021 is $150 billion, significant dry powder is on hand to deploy over a multiyear time horizon. Second, large pharma continues to be 1 of the best performing sectors in the market. In a year where total returns for market indices such as the NASDAQ and Dow ended the year down 10%, the top 20 biopharma ended the year up an average 12%, with 8 of the top 20 pharma ending the year with total returns over 20%.With historic levels of cash on hand, over $300 billion to deploy into R&amp;D and M&amp;A, biopharma has the firepower to continue to innovate and grow. And last, the pipeline of early innovation to commercialization continues to deliver to patients, with 37 novel FDA small molecule and biologic approvals, three gene therapy approvals and a novel cell therapy approval, of which nearly half were developed by Alexandria tenants. Moving to Alexandria's unrivaled life science tenant roster; we wanted to provide additional color on our business segments and some examples of Alexandria's tenants at the forefront of life science innovation. Starting with large pharma, $260 billion was reinvested into R&amp;D in 2021, and analysts estimate that, including leverage, pharma has over $600 billion to deploy into M&amp;A and partnerships.The next several years, indeed decade are going to be framed by large pharma's continued pursuit of innovation as product patents expire and new types of medicines such as mRNA and cell therapies transition from large preclinical and clinical pipelines to commercial stage. Alexandria tenant Pfizer is a great example, with preclinical and clinical -- sorry, with over 110 programs spanning early to late clinical developments, and an estimated 19 products launching in the next 18 months. The company also noted in their 4Q earnings this morning, they are targeting an additional $25 billion in revenue to come from M&amp;A activity by 2030. Transitioning to public biotech, our tenant base includes the majority commercial stage companies, which brought in nearly $150 billion in revenue in 2021.Tenants such as Amgen and Vertex have large diversified pipelines, driving long-term growth. As a note, Vertex is also leading the next generation of type 1 diabetes treatment with a novel clinical stage cell therapy that addresses the root cause of diabetes. For clinical-stage biotechnology companies, data is king. And those that have met and will meet clinical milestones in 2023, continue to see stock recovery and ability to access capital through follow-on financings. While the public markets are still recovering, life science follow-on financings reached nearly $17 billion in 2022, which is right on par with the average life science follow-on financings over the past decade. With respect to life science products, service and devices, this segment largely consists of commercial stage tenants.While not immune to higher interest rates and supply chain challenges, this is a big business segment that both drives and responds to the needs of researchers across academia, biotech and large pharma, which continue to grow and innovate. A notable development in the space is the rapid drop in the price of genome sequencing, driven by a healthy increase in competition. Costing $100 million to sequence a genome in 2001 and diving to $1,000 per genome in 2020, we are now looking at the $200 genome, enabling access to critical sequencing data that saves lives. So where are we headed in 2023? In the face of persistent economic headwinds, all industries are forced to double down on the areas of greatest value. As part of the reset, there are companies that won't make it, and we'd argue that this, in the long run, is healthy as capital is deployed more efficiently.There will continue to be further separation of haves and have nots, but companies like those on Alexandria's tenant roster with differentiated technologies, a clear road map to key inflection points such as generating clinical data and tenured management teams will continue to raise capital. As history has shown time and time again, some of the most successful companies are those created in the depths of a financial downturn. Ultimately, the life science industry is not built on technologies looking for a problem, but instead thousands among thousands of devastating problems, i.e. diseases that this incredibly innovative industry is poised to address over decades to come. To end on a note of hope from former FDA Commissioner, Scott Gotland.Our ingenuity drives our hopeful innovation, but it's our compassion for each other that inspires us to apply these advances to the purpose of reducing human suffering. With that, I'll pass it off to Peter.Peter Moglia: Thank you, Hallie. 2022 was quite a volatile year in the macro markets, a reminder that all businesses are subject to cycles, some more than others. The pruning we see in the tech industry today is not a surprise to anyone who's been around since the turn of the century. However, much like a broken bone, it will come back stronger after it heals. Unlike tech, developing products and services to address disease is hard and takes a lot of time, much harder and more time consuming than creating the next app to book a reservation or share recipes. Because of that, there is more discipline in life science investment, a discipline Alexandria has mirrored in our real estate strategy, which is why through the dot-com bust to the financial crisis, to whatever you want to label today's conditions, our business remains sound, as you can see in our results this quarter and during those historic down cycles.Despite the macro headlines, we remain optimistic and excited for our business as we are in the early innings of the Golden Age of Biology. We have only had the blueprint of the human genome for 20 years. And in that time, we've developed more new modalities to attack disease than in the previous 100. It's going to be hard, and it's going to take time, but the industry is going to have options for people with Alzheimer's. It's going to perfect technology to detect pancreatic cancer in time to save lives and much, much more. So let's all remember, it's hard, it takes time and patience, and then you will understand why life science research and development continues through the proverbial thick and thin of economic cycles, making our business resilient and essential.With that said, I'll briefly touch on our development pipeline progress, update you on construction trends, discuss our leasing and update you on investor demand for life science real estate. In 2022, our best-in-class development teams continue to deliver high-quality, purpose-built laboratory space to our tenants on time and on budget in a very challenging construction environment, which I'll touch on in a moment. During the fourth quarter, we delivered just shy of 500,000 square feet, with $28 million in annual NOI commencing during the quarter. For the year, we delivered 1.77 million square feet spread over 15 development and redevelopment projects, with annual NOI of $119.2 million commencing during the year. Initial stabilized yields for recent deliveries averaged 6.8% and 6.3% on a cash basis, reflecting the healthy contractual annual increases embedded into our leases.As of year-end, projects under construction and near-term projects expected to commence construction over the next four quarters totaled 7.6 million square feet and are 72% leased. Approximately 77% of that leasing has come from our approximately 1,000 existing tenant relationships. New projects added this quarter include 1450 Owens, which is approximately 213,000 square feet and will be 100% funded by our joint venture partner; and 10075 Barnes Canyon Road in Sorrento Mesa, which will be 50% funded by our joint venture partner. Both projects are under active leasing negotiations. Deliveries primarily commencing from the first quarter of '23 through the fourth quarter are expected to add $655 million in annual incremental NOI, reflecting a strong pipeline driven by consistent demand even in this volatile time.Transitioning to leasing, the fourth quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our unique one-of-a-kind company, with leasing volume of 2,322 square feet leased in the quarter, the fourth highest total in company history. The 8,405,587 square feet leased for the year is the second highest annual total in company history. And as you can see in the supplemental, the -- our guidance for strong mark-to-market growth remains unchanged from Investor Day with a range of 27% to 32% on a GAAP basis and 11% to 16% on cash. These results are certainly reflective of Hallie's commentary on the strength of VC funding and the stellar 2022 performance of large pharma. With $300 billion in cash on hand, we anticipate further investment in growth from this high-credit tenant sector in 2023.And the successful conversion of early innovation to commercialization reflected in the 37 FDA approvals in 2022 will incentivize continued investment in new and existing companies that have sound business models and underlying science, a cohort of companies Alexandria has a unique ability to identify. The highest quality life science tenants always consider occupancy in the best assets as an imperative. Their facility and campus are not only used for research and development, but is a critical tool for them to recruit and retain the best scientific and management talent in the world, which is by far their greatest asset. Therefore, demand for Alexandria facilities and our unrivaled mega campuses remains healthy as the facilities are A+, and our operational excellence is highly sought after.Moving to construction cost trends. At a high level, it appears the construction industry is on the cusp of slowing down. One of the leading economic indicators of the industry is the AIA Architectural Billings Index that leads nonresidential construction activity by nine to 12 months. Design work is at the front end of projects, so architects are the first consultants to slow down. Recent numbers show the 3% moving average heading towards no growth in billings, and commentary from the AIA was that fewer clients are expressing interest in starting new projects. For the first time since the postpandemic restart of construction projects, which was the genesis of significant cost inflation and supply chain problems, we're starting to see some signs of materials pricing flattening out and general contractors and subcontractors looking for work.That said, there are still items such as aluminum, rebar, copper and glass of 16% to 21% over this time last year, and it's still very difficult to obtain electrical switchgear, emergency generators, building controls and smart air handling units because despite an improvement in availability of chips, there are more products using chips than ever before so demand for them is still ahead of supply. Laboratory buildings are heavy consumers of these hard-to-get items so to keep a laboratory construction project on time and on budget is a difficult task. Alexandria has the Intel and experience needed to make quick decisions and relationships with critical vendors to ensure we have access to the materials and labor needed to meet our schedule and budgets.Despite the continued construction market pressures, as mentioned, we do believe the industry is on the cusp of slowing down, and we do expect cost escalations to reflect that in 2023, reducing from 9% to 10% -- from the range of 9% to 10% experienced in 2022 to 4% to 6% in 2023. However, the $2.3 trillion infrastructure spend over the next eight years will continue to put pressure on costs and labor so we will continue to conservatively underwrite and manage our value creation projects. As of the end of the year, 81% of our active development and redevelopment projects, aggregating 5.6 million square feet, are under GMP or other fixed contracts, which is consistent with the run rate we have maintained during these volatile times. Anticipating year-end volatility in the real estate investment markets, we completed our 2022 value harvesting and asset recycling efforts in the third quarter with impeccable execution as we laid out at Investor Day.Overall, we completed $2.2 billion of value harvesting, with the improved properties achieving a weighted average cap rate of 4.4%, realizing a total gain of $1.2 billion and a value creation margin of 107%. This is a tremendous achievement considering the volatile interest rate environment in 2022 with many real estate investors on the sidelines. It speaks to the desirability of our assets, which are in the best markets with high-quality tenants and managed with operational excellence. High-quality life science assets are scarce, and that is reflected in the pricing. We have started working on, and are making good progress on 2023 value harvesting and asset recycling, and we'll update you on that next quarter. But in the meantime, we'd like to report on three notable non-Alexandria sales that illustrate that there is still strong demand for life science real estate product.The first is the sale of 1828 El Camino Real and in the Bay Area. Anchored by three non-credit life science tenants, the property is 98% leased, but is extremely low quality, with limited window line, no shipping and receiving, no backup power and venting through the windows to get adequate HVAC. Despite this, an investor paid $902 per square foot for this asset at a cap rate of 5.8%. The second trade was in the Route 128 submarket of Lexington, where a single non-credit tenant occupied 101,310 square foot manufacturing building at 20 McGuire Road sold in October for $878 per square foot and a 6.2% cap rate. The third comp, which closed last week, is an R&amp;D campus known as the Gauge and Center Point in the Route 128 submarket of Waltham. It traded for $983 per square foot and a 5% cap rate.It was reported that some of that -- some vacancy existed at that property and that the stabilized return is likely to be in the high 5s. As the Fed continues to pull levers to battle inflation, we expect we will see cap rates move up, but much less on a relative basis to other product types, and thus we remain well positioned to fund our value creation pipeline efficiently and at a relatively attractive pricing by harvesting our value creation among other sources. With that, I'll pass it over to Dean.Dean Shigenaga: Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We'll jump right in here. Our team is very pleased to have the strongest balance sheet in the company's history as of December 31. And this really is a result of disciplined execution of liability management year-to-year over the past decade. Our key highlights include, we really have earned our corporate credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of the REIT industry today. We ended the year with tremendous liquidity of $5.3 billion that provides us important flexibility in this macro environment. No debt maturities until 2025, a statement only a small handful of REITs can make today, and a weighted average remaining term of debt at 13.2 years. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 5.1 times on a quarter annualized basis, 5.2x on a trailing 12-month basis.The fixed charge coverage ratio was very strong at 5.0x, and 99.4% of outstanding debt is subject to fixed interest rates. Our team had outstanding execution in 2022 on our strategic capital plan. Key highlights include $1.8 billion of 12-year and 30-year bonds, with a weighted average rate of 3.28%, the term of 22 years completed in February of 2022. Outstanding execution by our team, as Peter had highlighted, on outright dispositions, partial interest sales, aggregating $2.2 billion, with an amazing $1.2 billion in gains or consideration in excess of booked value, a 4.4% cap rate on cash NOI, all exceptional statistics and significant value creation tap for reinvestment. We had disciplined issuance of common equity with proceeds aggregating $2.5 billion at an average price of $189 per share, including 105 million sold under forward equity sales agreements in December of 2022.On a blended basis for the year, we felt comfortable executing on the modest $105 million under the equity under forward equity sales agreements in December at roughly $150 per share. Now briefly on the bond market, the beginning of 2023 has been positive for high-quality issuers like Alexandria. Overall pricing for 10-year bonds for Alexandria has significantly improved, and as of yesterday, was in the upper 4% range or just below 5%. For 2023, we will continue to focus on execution of real estate dispositions and partial interest sales or joint ventures for a significant component of our 2023 capital plan. Two transactions are under executed LOI to bring in a partner on a portion of each asset. These transactions will provide approximately $370 million of equity-type capital in 2023, and there are other transactions that we expect to complete this year.Turning to operating and financial results, really, congratulations to our entire team for outstanding execution this year or in 2022 during a very challenging macro environment. We reported total revenues of $2.6 billion, up 22.5% over 2021, with FFO per share as adjusted of $8.42, up 8.5% over 2021, and outperforming our initial outlook for 2022 of $8.36 by $0.06, and ahead of consensus, both for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2022. Now diving into key highlights from our truly amazing operating and financial results for 2022. Strong rental rate growth, leasing volume and occupancy growth drove record same-property NOI growth in 2022 of 6.6% and 9.6% on a cash basis, exceeding our 10-year average same-property NOI growth prior to 2022 of 6% and 2.9% on a cash basis.docstockmedia/Shutterstock.comThe last four years of rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing the space have been the highest in the company's history, including rental rate growth of 31% in 2022. Over the last two years, cash rental rate growth has been the highest in the company's history, including 22.1% for the full year of 2022. Leasing volume in the fourth quarter was robust relative to the quarterly average volume in recent years in the range of 1.1 to 1.3 rentable square feet per quarter, highlighting the continued demand from our client tenants. Now the last two years have generated the two highest annual periods of rentable square feet leased, including 8.4 million rentable square feet in 2022. three out of the last four quarters represented the highest quarterly periods of rentable square feet leased, including two million square feet in the fourth quarter.Now turning to occupancy, occupancy was up 80 basis points since the beginning of 2021 to 94.8% as of December 31. Now looking forward into 2023, we expect a slight decline in occupancy in the first half of the year, with recovery expected in the second half of the year. We had a similar dip in occupancy in 2022, specifically overall strong occupancy in the year, but we did have a 40-basis-point decline from the first quarter of '22 to the third quarter of '22. For 2023, we expect temporary vacancy beginning in the first quarter related to spaces that, on average, are expected to generate significant rental rate growth, greater than 60% on a cash basis. Now these spaces are forecasted for occupancy over the next five quarters. This includes a mix of small redevelopment space, i.e., the first time conversion to lab space, normal lease expirations and a few early tenant departures.Importantly, consistent with our general quarter-to-quarter growth in FFO per share for many years, we expect quarter-to-quarter growth in FFO per share in 2023. Now a few other key highlights. 90% of our annual rental revenue is from investment-grade or large-cap publicly traded companies within our top 20 tenants, highlighting the high-quality list of client tenants that our team has curated over the years. 99.4% of collections of January rent through January 27, just highlighting the continued strength of rent collections. And we had a very strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%, highlighting execution of operational excellence by our team. Cash flows from operating activities after dividends for 2023 is expected to be very strong at $375 million at the midpoint of our guidance, and will continue to support growth in our annual common stock dividends per share.Our FFO payout ratio was very solid at 58% for the fourth quarter. And at this pace, cash flows from operating activities after dividends, over the next three years, should generate over $1 billion and that's an amazing statistic and very efficient capital for reinvestment. Now turning to a couple of important real estate highlights. Construction in progress, otherwise known as CIP is forecasted to peak in the first quarter, then declined slightly through 2023 as the dollar amount of deliveries are expected to exceed additions to CIP quarter-to-quarter, highlighting the significant volume of deliveries over the next couple of years. As Peter had highlighted, we have 7.6 million rentable square feet of projects that are 72% leased and projected to generate $655 million of incremental net operating income over the next three years.In the fourth quarter, we recognized impairments aggregating $26.2 million on real estate, primarily related to a few assets we plan to sell in 2023. Each asset is small and represents noncore assets no longer strategic for Alexandria to own. And to put this into perspective, the book value of assets held for sale was approximately $120 million as of December 31. The key takeaway is that from time to time, we review our asset base and proceed with selective sales that continue to enhance the quality of the remaining asset base. Briefly on venture investments. FFO per share as adjusted over the last 2 years has included an average of $103 million of realized gains each year from venture investments, or approximately $26 million per quarter. Now quarterly gains from venture investments in 2023 are expected to be up slightly in comparison to this recent quarterly run rate.As of December 31, 2022, we had gross unrealized gains of $506 million on a cost basis of $1.15 billion, highlighting significant value in our venture investment portfolio. Now investments in our venture portfolio have been very modest, at less than $70 million in aggregate over the last five years, including $20.5 million that we recognized in the fourth quarter. Turning to guidance. We reaffirm guidance for 2023 that was initially provided in connection with our Annual Investor Day on November 30 with 1 minor update. We updated excess cash held from bond proceeds to $300 million, representing a $50 million increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance. Our 2023 guidance for EPS diluted is a range from $3.41 to $3.61, and FFO per share as adjusted diluted is a range from $8.86 to $9.06 with no change in the midpoint of $8.96.Now under the current common stock distribution agreement we have in place, otherwise known as our ATM program, we have approximately 142 remaining available. We expect to file a new program in the first quarter of '23. Please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for detailed underlying assumptions included in our strong outlook for the full year of 2023. With that, let me turn it back to Joel.Joel Marcus: Thank you.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Unum in FocusUnum (UNM) is headquartered in Chattanooga, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 2.44% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.33 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.14%. In comparison, the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield is 2.19%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.59%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.32 is up 4.8% from last year. Unum has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.16%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Unum's current payout ratio is 23%. This means it paid out 23% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for UNM for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $6.30 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 1.45%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, UNM is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN), Enbridge Inc. (ENB) and Fiserv, Inc. (FISV). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Texas Instruments have underperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (-5.7% vs. -23.4%). The company is facing sluggishness in the Analog segment remains a concern. Further, weakening momentum across personal electronics and industrial end-markets is a negative. Additionally, pandemic-led supply-chain disruptions and imposition of new export regulations are headwinds.However, Texas Instruments fourth quarter results were driven by solid momentum across its Embedded Processing segment. Growing demand for embedded technologies across the automotive and industrial markets contributed well.Additionally, continued rebound in the automotive market was a tailwind. We note that the company’s growing investments in new growth avenues and competitive advantages remain tailwinds. Further, its portfolio of long-lived products and efficient manufacturing strategies are other positives.(You can read the full research report on Texas Instruments here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Enbridge have underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines industry over the past year (-4.9% vs. +1.7%). The company has significant debt exposure since there has been a weakness in its operations. Also, it has mostly been yielding lower dividends than the industry over the past year.  As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.However, Enbridge has the longest and most sophisticated oil and liquids pipeline system in the world, which spreads across 17,809 miles. Hence, a significant portion of the midstream operator’s earnings is generated from transportation operations, driven by a string of long-term contracts.Enbridge increased its annualized common share dividend to C$3.55 per share, thereby marking a dividend hike for 28 straight years. The leading midstream company expects to put more than C$13 billion growth projects into service in 2024 and beyond. This is expected to generate significant EBITDA growth in the coming years.(You can read the full research report on Enbridge here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Fiserv have declined -1.5% over the past year against the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry’s decline of -10.7%. The company is facing stiff competition which makes it a difficult task for strong and long-term client relationships. Acquisition of a large number of companies results in some integration risk. Fiserv has more long-term debt outstanding than cash.However, Fiserv enjoys a dominant position in the financial and payments solutions business on the back of broad and diverse customer base, and continued technology upgrades. FISV's diversified product portfolio helps attract a steady flow of customers.Acquisitions help expand its product portfolio, enhance offerings, boost its market share and customer base. The company has been consistently rewarding shareholders through share buybacks. These initiatives instill investors’ confidence, positively impacting earnings per share.(You can read the full research report on Finserv here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include UBS Group AG (UBS), State Street Corp.

If you want to see more top performing dividend stocks in January 2023, go directly to 5 Top Performing Dividend Stocks in January 2023.January has been a pretty good month for the S&amp;P 500 as the index is up around 5% year to date as of January 30.One reason for the good performance could be better than expected economic data.In terms of the United States, U.S. GDP expanded by a 2.9% annualized pace in Q4 2022, slightly better than expected.In terms of the world, the IMF said on January 30 it expected the global economy to expand 2.9% in 2023, or a 0.2 percentage point increase from the agency's previous forecast in October. For those of you interested, check out Countries by GDP: 30 Largest Economies in the World.In terms of inflation, it seems to have cooled from its previous 2022 highs given the rise in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks.While the S&amp;P 500 has done well this month, some dividend stocks have done even better with some of the top performing dividend stocks rising more than 13% year to date.In terms of the stocks that have done really well in January, there could be various reasons for their out performance.Some of the top performing dividend stocks in January 2023 are companies that have for various reasons fallen substantially in the past. With the change in market sentiment, their share prices have increased.Other stocks like Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) are arguably value stocks that are likely trading below what it is worth in the long term if macroeconomic conditions normalize. In Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)'s case, it is trading for substantially below price to book value.While the market is currently optimistic that interest rates might not rise as much as previously expected, the Federal Reserve and economic data will ultimately make that decision. If economic data doesn't meet estimates or the Federal Reserve raises rates further than expected, the market and top performing dividend stocks could both decline. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesMethodologyFor our list of 12 Top Performing Dividend Stocks in January 2023, we selected stocks with a market capitalization of over $10 billion that had dividend yields of over 1% as of 1/30 according to Finviz.com.We then filtered the stocks to ensure they exceeded the S&amp;P 500's January performance of 5% by a wide margin.12 Top Performing Dividend Stocks in January 202312. Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD)Year to Date Performance as of 1/30: 13.36%Dividend Yield as of 1/30: 2.47%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) is an industrial REIT that declined around 16% in the last year given the rise in interest rates. Not only is the cost of new debt higher with higher interest rates, but also REIT dividend yields are less attractive if Treasury yields are higher. With inflation showing signs of potentially peaking, however, some investors have rotated back into leading REITs like Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) in January in anticipation of an eventual renormalization of interest rates. When interest rates will normalize is up for debate as many think it could be at least several years.Alongside InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (NYSE:IHG), Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF), and Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) is a top performing dividend stock in January 2023.11. Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR)Year to Date Performance as of 1/30: 13.83%Dividend Yield as of 1/30: 3.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) is a healthcare REIT that is close to flat in terms of its performance in the last year. Like many other REITs, Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) shares weakened in middle to late 2022 given the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases which made REIT dividend yields less attractive, all else equal. In recent months, however, Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) shares have bounced back with the REIT up nearly 14% in January as of 1/30 as many leading sector names have also done well.10. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Year to Date Performance as of 1/30: 14.42%Dividend Yield as of 1/30: 3.94%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is one of the big four American banks that's trading for substantially below its book value. According to the bank, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) ended 2022 with tangible book value per share of $81.65 and book value per share of $94.06. Over the course of 2022, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) returned $7 billion back to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, which given the stock's current market capitalization of around $100 billion indicates a capital return of around 7%. Although the bank might not trade for its book value any time soon, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) stock could potentially narrow the gap between its stock price and its book value in the long term given share repurchases and if it increases its earnings.9. State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT)Year to Date Performance as of 1/30: 16.22%Dividend Yield as of 1/30: 2.80%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) is a leading asset management company whose stock has more than doubled from 2012. Although shares are down around 2.5% in the last year, State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) stock has rallied 16.22% in January as of 1/30 as capital has rotated back into many leading financial names. State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) also has a dividend yield of 2.80% which is pretty decent combined with the company's long term growth potential if it maintains its market share.8. KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR)Year to Date Performance as of 1/30: 17.26%Dividend Yield as of 1/30: 1.14%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR) is a leading asset management firm whose stock has surged 17.26% year to date as of 1/30, ranking #8 on our list of 12 Top Performing Dividend Stocks in January 2023. Capital could be rotating back into leading alternative asset managers in anticipation that the peak interest rates might not be as high as previously expected given the cooling inflation data. If interest rates don't rise as much as expected, KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR)'s earnings power could potentially increase with less cost of debt to finance purchases or new growth projects.7. The Carlyle Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CG)Year to Date Performance as of 1/30: 17.83%Dividend Yield as of 1/30: 3.48%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30The Carlyle Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CG) is another leading asset management firm whose stock has done well in January. As of 1/30, The Carlyle Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CG) shares have increased by 17.83%, around the same as its peer, KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR). If the economy doesn't weaken as much as expected, The Carlyle Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CG)'s AUM could potentially increase faster than expected and its earnings power could be stronger than expected as well.6. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)Year to Date Performance as of 1/30: 17.89%Dividend Yield as of 1/30: 1.80%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Although it isn't anywhere the size of its once peer Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), internet retailer eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)'s stock has surged by nearly 18% in January as other leading tech stocks have also rebounded thanks to improved sentiment. In the long term, eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)'s stock has still more than doubled from its 2013 levels. Unlike some other leading tech names, eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) also has a pretty decent dividend yield of 1.80% as of 1/30. At the end of Q3, 42 hedge funds in our database of 920 funds held shares in eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY).Like eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (NYSE:IHG), Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF), and Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) are top performing dividend stocks in January.Click to continue reading and see 5 Top Performing Dividend Stocks in January 2023.Suggested articles:15 Most Innovative Countries in the World15 Most Valuable Silicon Valley Companies in the World25 Highest Paid Athletes of All TimeDisclosure: None. 12 Top Performing Dividend Stocks in January 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The three-chip solution provides configurable GaN bias point autocalibration, enabling engineers to maximize system performance for different GaN power amplifiers (PAs) without changing the board design.Qorvo’s new chipset optimizes one of the largest and most expensive parts of a phased array system: the pulsed-energy storage capacitors. Through an innovative new architecture, this solution reduces capacitance by up to 90%, shrinking system volume by up to 30% while reducing weight and operating costs.Philip Chesley, president of Qorvo’s High Performance Analog business, said, “This complete radar power solution integrates advanced technologies from across Qorvo, combining an innovative new power conversion architecture, our best-in-class GaN RF power amplifiers and efficient, reliable silicon carbide FETs.”The new three-stage solution consists of the following:ACT43950 is a high-voltage constant-current capacitor charge controller that works with Qorvo’s silicon carbide power switches to provide fully programmable output voltage and current, allowing customers to maximize system performance. This regulator’s architecture, in conjunction with the following stages, minimizes power storage capacitor requirements.ACT43850, an RF Point-of-Load (RFPoL) step-down DC-DC power converter, takes the output from the ACT43950 and steps it down to a well-regulated voltage optimized for Qorvo GaN power amplifiers. Its advanced configuration options allow RF system designers to minimize noise and EMI, maximizing the performance of the radar array.ACT43750 is a highly-integrated drain switch and negative gate voltage regulator PMIC that enables ultra-fast RF GaN PA drain switching. By automating gate voltage bias sequencing, autocalibration and dynamic bias recalibration, Qorvo simplifies system manufacturing while mitigating the effects of device aging and temperature on RF performance.Story continuesQorvo offers an evaluation board (CB1-750-850-950) that allows customers to test the performance of this three-stage solution with a wide set of RF GaN PAs. The evaluation board’s intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) allows customers to reconfigure the default settings to optimize performance for their specific PA. It demonstrates the reduced bulk capacitor requirements and gate bias autocalibration. The board’s flexible design can be used to evaluate the individual stages or the entire three-chip solution with an RF PA, enabling faster time to market.To learn more about Qorvo's radar chipset solution and request samples, visit http://www.qorvo.com/go/pwr-radar-chipset.About QorvoQorvo (Nasdaq: QRVO) supplies innovative semiconductor solutions that make a better world possible.

Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is either adjusted from GAAP results to exclude certain expenses or derived from multiple GAAP measures, which are outlined in the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” tables, attached, and the “Additional Selected Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations” tables, attached.In managing Qorvo's business on a consolidated basis, management develops an annual operating plan, which is approved by our Board of Directors, using non-GAAP financial measures. In developing and monitoring performance against this plan, management considers the actual or potential impacts on these non-GAAP financial measures from actions taken to reduce costs with the goal of increasing gross margin and operating margin. In addition, management relies upon these non-GAAP financial measures to assess whether research and development efforts are at an appropriate level, and when making decisions about product spending, administrative budgets, and other operating expenses. Also, we believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors and enable investors to analyze the results of operations in the same way as management. We have chosen to provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of our operating results, to assess our liquidity and capital position and to analyze financial performance excluding the effect of expenses unrelated to operations, certain non-cash expenses and stock-based compensation expense, which may obscure trends in Qorvo's underlying performance.We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures offer an additional view of Qorvo's operations that, when coupled with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of Qorvo's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting Qorvo's business. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.Our rationale for using these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as their impact on the presentation of Qorvo's operations, are outlined below:Non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin.  Non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin exclude amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring related charges and certain non-cash expenses. We believe that exclusion of these costs in presenting non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical performance and projected costs and the potential for realizing cost efficiencies.We view amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, and customer relationships, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities, determined at the time of an acquisition, rather than ongoing costs of operating Qorvo’s business. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangible assets is a static expense, which is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Although we exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets from these non-GAAP financial measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase price accounting and contribute to revenue generation.We believe that presentation of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and other non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of stock-based compensation expense assists management and investors in evaluating the period-over-period performance of Qorvo's ongoing operations because (i) the expenses are non-cash in nature, and (ii) although the size of the grants is within our control, the amount of expense varies depending on factors such as short-term fluctuations in stock price volatility and prevailing interest rates, which can be unrelated to the operational performance of Qorvo during the period in which the expense is incurred and generally are outside the control of management. Moreover, we believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense in presenting non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and other non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors to understand the impact of the expensing of stock-based compensation to Qorvo's gross profit and gross margins and other financial measures in comparison to prior periods. We also believe that the adjustments to profit and margin related to restructuring related charges and certain non-cash expenses do not constitute part of Qorvo's ongoing operations and therefore the exclusion of these items provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual revenue and actual costs required to generate revenues over time and facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical and projected performance. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin has economic substance because the excluded expenses do not represent continuing cash expenditures and, as described above, we have little control over the timing and amount of the expenses in question.Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration related costs, gain or loss on assets, asset impairments, start-up costs, restructuring related charges and certain non-cash expenses. We believe that presentation of a measure of operating income and operating margin that excludes amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense is useful to both management and investors for the same reasons as described above with respect to our use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin. We believe that acquisition and integration related costs, gain or loss on assets, asset impairments, start-up costs, restructuring related charges and certain non-cash expenses do not constitute part of Qorvo's ongoing operations and therefore, the exclusion of these costs provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual costs required to generate revenues over time and facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical and projected performance. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP operating income and operating margin has economic substance because the excluded expenses are either unrelated to ongoing operations or do not represent current cash expenditures.Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration related costs, gain or loss on assets, asset impairments, start-up costs, restructuring related charges, certain non-cash expenses, gain or loss on investments, other expense (income) and also reflect an adjustment of income taxes. The income tax adjustment primarily represents the use of research and development tax credit carryforwards, deferred tax expense (benefit) items not affecting taxes payable, adjustments related to the deemed and actual repatriation of historical foreign earnings, non-cash expense (benefit) related to uncertain tax positions and other items unrelated to the current fiscal year or that are not indicative of our ongoing business operations. We believe that presentation of measures of net income and net income per diluted share that exclude these items is useful to both management and investors for the reasons described above with respect to non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and non-GAAP operating income and operating margin. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share has economic substance because the excluded expenses are either unrelated to ongoing operations or do not represent current cash expenditures.Non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development and selling, general and administrative). Non-GAAP research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and certain non-cash expenses (primarily acquisition and integration related costs). We believe that presentation of measures of these operating expenses that exclude amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense is useful to both management and investors for the same reasons as described above with respect to our use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin. We believe that acquisition and integration related costs and certain non-cash expenses do not constitute part of Qorvo's ongoing operations and therefore, the exclusion of these costs provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual costs required to generate revenues over time and facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical and projected performance. We believe disclosure of these non-GAAP operating expenses has economic substance because the excluded expenses are either unrelated to ongoing operations or do not represent current cash expenditures.Free cash flow. Qorvo defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities during the period minus property and equipment expenditures made during the period, and free cash flow margin is calculated as free cash flow as a percentage of revenue. We use free cash flow as a supplemental financial measure in our evaluation of liquidity and financial strength. Management believes that this measure is useful as an indicator of our ability to service our debt, meet other payment obligations and make strategic investments. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, our definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statement of cash flows.EBITDA. Qorvo adjusts GAAP net income for interest expense, interest income, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and intangible amortization expense, stock-based compensation and other charges that are not representative of Qorvo's ongoing operations (including asset impairments, investment activity, acquisition-related costs and restructuring-related costs) when presenting EBITDA. Management believes that this measure is useful to evaluate our ongoing operations and as a general indicator of our operating cash flow (in conjunction with a cash flow statement which also includes among other items, changes in working capital and the effect of non-cash charges).Non-GAAP ROIC. Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor by measuring the effectiveness of our operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. We use ROIC to track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Non-GAAP ROIC is calculated by dividing annualized non-GAAP operating income, net of an adjustment for income taxes (as described above), by average invested capital. Average invested capital is calculated by subtracting the average of the beginning balance and the ending balance of equity plus net debt, less certain goodwill.Net debt or positive net cash. Net debt or positive net cash is defined as unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments minus any borrowings under our credit facility and the principal balance of our senior unsecured notes. Management believes that net debt or positive net cash provides useful information regarding the level of Qorvo's indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt.Inventory days on hand. Inventory days on hand is defined as (a) average net inventory for the period, divided by (b) the result of non-GAAP cost of goods sold for the period divided by the number of days in the period.Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures.  Our earnings release contains forward-looking free cash flow, gross margin, income tax rate and diluted earnings per share. We provide these non-GAAP measures to investors on a prospective basis for the same reasons (set forth above) that we provide them to investors on a historical basis. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort due to variability and difficulty in making accurate projections for items that would be required to be included in the GAAP measures, such as stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration related costs, restructuring related charges, gain or loss on assets, asset impairments, gain or loss on investments and the provision for income taxes, which could have a potentially significant impact on our future GAAP results.Limitations of non-GAAP financial measures. The primary material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool compared to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are these non-GAAP financial measures (i) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry, and (ii) exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance, thus limiting their usefulness as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing full disclosure of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the corresponding GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, to enable investors to perform their own analysis of our gross profit and gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, net income per diluted share and net cash provided by operating activities. We further compensate for the limitations of our use of non-GAAP financial measures by presenting the corresponding GAAP measures more prominently.Qorvo will conduct a conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET today to discuss today’s press release.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $43.31 billion.The company projects adjusted EPS to be $23.70. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $22.92.Our TakeThermo Fisher exited the fourth quarter with better-than-expected results. The robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising. During the fourth quarter, the company opened a new state-of-the-art bioanalytical lab in Richmond, Virginia, to support our clinical research business and the increasing demand for analytical services to accelerate drug development. Moreover, the company continued to successfully execute its capital deployment strategy in 2022. The integration of PPD is largely complete and drove strong returns for the shareholders with outstanding execution and business performance throughout the year.However, the year-over-year decline in revenues in the Life Science Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segment is disappointing. The contraction of both margins on escalating costs and expenses does not bode well either.

This compares to earnings of $6.54 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.05%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies would post earnings of $4.78 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.08, delivering a surprise of 6.28%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Thermo Fisher , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, posted revenues of $11.45 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.55%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $10.7 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Thermo Fisher shares have added about 3.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.2%.What's Next for Thermo Fisher?While Thermo Fisher has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Thermo Fisher: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments.Michael Mussallem: Thank you, Mark. During 2022, our company stayed focused on the long term, making meaningful progress on strategic milestones with the potential of transforming patient care. While the challenging environment negatively impacted sales, we still grew 8%. Looking forward, we remain optimistic that the health care environment will gradually improve and we expect 9% to 12% sales growth in 2023. We didn't pull back on investing in innovation because of the pandemic, and we didn't pull back because sales fell a little short. We continue to aggressively invest during this challenging period, which positions the company for sustained leadership in a new era of structural heart and critical care innovation. Looking back at 2022, in TAVR, we made important strides in executing our long-term strategy.We received approval and launched the innovative SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve. In TMTT, each of our platforms demonstrated promising clinical performance, and we received approval for PASCAL Precision in the U.S. and Europe. In Surgical Structural Heart, we extended our leadership position through the launch of MITRIS in the U.S. And in Critical Care, we continue to drive adoption of our transformative smart recovery technologies. Although our initial sales expectations for 2022 anticipated a better environment, we delivered balanced contributions across each of our product groups and regions. We achieved 12% growth in adjusted earnings per share while maintaining R&amp;D at more than 17% of sales, which reflects our commitment to driving durable organic sales growth.Consistent with our cash deployment strategy, we opportunistically repurchased stock at an accelerated level in 2022. We continue to invest in our production capacity in anticipation of future growth. and we made a series of external investments in promising early-stage technologies. Turning to our fourth quarter financial results. Consistent with our guidance, total company sales grew 7% on a constant currency basis to $1.3 billion. Our broad portfolio of innovative therapies drove this growth despite the health care disruptions in a number of our key geographies. In TAVR, full year 2022 global TAVR sales of $3.5 billion increased 7% on a constant currency basis, building on nearly 20% growth in the year ago period. Sales were below our original guidance of $3.7 billion to $4.0 billion due to foreign exchange headwinds and Covet induced health care challenges in key countries.In 2022, we announced the approval of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in the U.S. Separately, we continue to advance enrollment in our PROGRESS pivotal trial for moderate AS patients and gained significant learnings from our alliance pivotal trial to study the next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4. These transformative developments reinforce our long-term confidence in the strong growth of transcatheter-based aortic valve interventions. In the fourth quarter, our global TAVR procedures were comparable with Edwards growth. Our global -- I should say, global TAVR procedures were comparable with Edwards growth. Our global TAVR sales of $868 million increased 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, consistent with our expectations. Sales were up slightly over Q3 in dollars and on a constant currency basis and local selling prices were stable.In the U.S., Edwards fourth quarter TAVR procedures grew in the mid-single-digit range. As expected, our fourth quarter U.S. TAVR procedure volumes were impacted by the U.S. hospital staffing constraints and the holiday season slowdown. We estimate that our share of procedures was stable. Growth in the U.S. was higher in larger volume centers and in states with fewer COVID restrictions as measured by the Daxferns Containment and Health Index. We're encouraged by recent hiring trends, which suggests that hospital employment is rebounding. As we mentioned, we began the introduction of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in the U.S. the Resilient issues anti-calcification technology addresses one of the primary causes of reintervention following heart valve replacement and is demonstrating a strong track record of performance in Edwards Surgical house.As of now, this newest valve has been introduced in approximately 10% of U.S. TAVR centers and physician feedback has been encouraging. Outside of the U.S., in the fourth quarter, Edwards TAVR procedures also grew in the mid-single digits, and we estimate total procedure growth was comparable. In Q4, geographies outside of Europe and Japan grew even faster in the quarter. Long term, we see excellent opportunities for growth as we believe international adoption of TAVR remains quite low. In Europe, fourth quarter procedures grew in line with the global rate. Market growth continued to be impacted by a bump in the COVID cases and staffing shortages, which reduced hospital capacity, particularly in larger countries such as Germany. And even though there are a broad range of competitors, our leadership position and local selling prices remained stable throughout the year.Importantly, a cost-effectiveness study published earlier this month demonstrated that TAVR with SAPIEN three was economically beneficial when compared to surgical aortic valve replacement in treating German patients with low surgical risk. The data suggests that TAVR enhances quality of life and offers a cost-effective option over the long term. These findings are consistent with the cost-effective outcomes for the use of SAPIEN 3 in France, Italy and Spain. In Japan, fourth quarter procedure growth was much slower than expected due to an extended COVID wave and continued restrictions, which limited hospital staffing and capacity. We expect these factors to diminish substantially over the course of 2023 and look forward to launching SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in Japan later this year.We remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy driven by the fact that AS remains a significantly undertreated disease amongst this large elderly population. In summary, our outlook assumes COVID-related challenges improved during 2023 as hospital resource constraints decrease. We remain positive in our outlook for 2023 underlying TAVR sales growth of 9% to 12%, consistent with the range we shared at our December investor conference. We remain confident in this large global opportunity that will double to $10 billion by 2028, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range. Turning to TMTT. Since launch, we have proudly treated more than 10,000 patients with the PASCAL repair system. We achieved significant milestones in 2022 and made meaningful progress toward achieving our vision to transform care for patients with mitral and tricuspid disease.Following the Class II presentation at TCT and FDA approval in Q3, we initiated the introduction of the PASCAL Precision system in the U.S. Initial feedback from clinicians has been positive, and we're pleased with the patient outcomes to date. Class IID full cohort of 300 patients with 1-year follow-up will be presented in the second half of 2023. In Europe, the PASCAL Precision launch is ongoing with a focus on bringing this latest advancement to our existing centers as well as expanding into new centers. Also aligned with our commitment to generate high-quality scientific evidence we continue to advance enrollment in our Class IIF pivotal trial for patients with functional mitral regurgitation. In mitral replacement, we're making good progress on the enrollment of the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and expect to complete enrollment of the main cohort around the end of 2023.The sub French transfemoral valve leverages the SAPIEN 3 platform with a recapturable repositionable dock. Separately, we've completed enrollment in the MISCEND early feasibility study with the Eos valve and are incorporating the learnings from this early experience into our next generation. We believe the Eos platform has the potential to be an excellent option for mitral patients, who have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Shifting to tricuspid and our strategy of advancing the body of clinical evidence, we are currently enrolling two pivotal trials studying both tricuspid replacement and repair, TRISCEND II and the Class II TR. We prioritized enrollment in our TRISCEND II study, that study trial that's studying EVOQUE as it addresses the large population of patients who are suffering from debilitating systems and have few treatment options.TRISCEND II is on track for completion of enrollment in the first half of 2023, and we expect Evoke CE mark by the end of this year and U.S. approval around the end of '24. We're very pleased with the recent tricuspid data presented at PCR London Valves meeting which we reported favorable results from both our TRISCEND study of EVOQUE and the TriCLASP post-market clinical follow-up for PASCAL. In Europe, clinicians are very positive about the performance of our differentiated PASCAL Precision system in their tricuspid patients, and we're looking forward to bringing this therapy to patients in the U.S. following the Class II TR trial. Turning to the sales performance of TMTT. Fourth quarter sales of $32 million were consistent with our latest guidance and driven by the continued adoption of PASCAL in Europe supported by the early initiation of PASCAL Precision in the U.S. Full year global sales were $116 million, up nearly 50% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year.In 2023, we expect TMTT sales of $160 million to $200 million. We look forward to advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease through the milestones outlined in our recent investor conference. We remain committed to bringing this differentiated portfolio of therapies to patients with these life-threatening diseases and believe our strategy positions us well for leadership. In Surgical Structural Heart, full year global sales were $893 million, up 6% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Fourth quarter 2022 global sales of $224 million increased 8% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. We are encouraged to see strong global growth driven by the increased penetration of our premium RESILIA products despite COVID challenges in certain regions.Although hospital staffing shortages continue to be a concern, we believe that heart valve surgery was prioritized. We have seen strong momentum of the RESILIA portfolio globally. We believe that surgeons value the features and benefits of this advanced tissue technology for both aortic and mitral surgical valve replacement procedures. We saw adoption of the MITRIS RESILIA valve in the U.S. increased in the fourth quarter. And built upon previous generations of proven mitral valve technology, MITRIS offers greater ease of use and is designed to facilitate potential future transcatheter interventions. We are growing the large body of RESILIA evidence with our new Momentis clinical study to demonstrate the durability of this tissue in the mitral position.Enrollment in this study was initiated earlier this month. In summary, we remain confident that our full year 2023 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-single digits for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by the adoption of our most advanced technologies and growth of overall heart valve surgeries. Turning to Critical Care. Full year global sales of $855 million increased 7% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of $225 million increased 13% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. Growth was driven by contributions from all product lines and regions led by HemoSphere and Smart Recovery. In our Smart Recovery portfolio, adoption of FloTrac and ClearSight sensors featuring our unique hypotension prediction index algorithm RECONNECT remains strong.Pressmaster/Shutterstock.comDemand for our pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU due to elevated hospitalizations in the U.S. As discussed at our recent investor conference, sales growth in 2023. We remain enthusiastic about our pipeline of critical care innovations, highlighted by smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions and get patients home to their families faster. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.Scott Ullem: Thanks a lot, Mike. Today, I will provide a wrap-up of 2022, including detailed results for the fourth quarter as well as provide guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2023. So as Mike mentioned, our sales of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter grew 7% on a constant currency basis, despite the health care disruptions in a number of our key geographies. Our gross profit margin was healthy, even excluding the temporarily inflated rate due to FX. Combined with sales growth and disciplined spending, this resulted in adjusted earnings per share growth of 25% to $0.64. GAAP earnings per share was $0.65. Obviously, we were disappointed with our stock performance last year. The only upside to the poor stock price performance was that it provided an opportunistic time to repurchase shares more aggressively.During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $750 million of stock through an accelerated share repurchase program. And in total, we repurchased $1.7 billion of stock last year. Average shares outstanding during the fourth quarter fell to $616 million. We have approximately $900 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. For the full year 2022, sales increased 8% over the prior year on a constant currency basis to $5.4 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew 12% and we generated nearly $1 billion of free cash flow. We expect our sales growth rate to expand in 2023 with a gradual improvement in hospital staffing. Although still early in the year, we saw encouraging signals during Q4 and a good start so far in Q1, which reinforces our confidence about the 9% to 12% full year range.We are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2023. Absent big moves in FX, we expect total company sales of $5.6 billion to $6 billion, TAVR sales of $3.6 billion to $4 billion, TMTT sales of $160 million to $200 million, Surgical Structural Heart sales of $870 million to $970 million and critical care sales of $840 million to $940 million. For the first quarter, we're projecting sales of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.58 to $0.64. Now I'll cover details of our results. Our adjusted gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was 81% compared to 76.8% in the same period last year. This improvement was driven by the expected positive impact from our FX program which includes hedge contract gains and natural hedges that offset the negative sales impact from the weakening of the euro and the yen against the dollar.At current foreign exchange rates, we continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 78%. At current exchange rates, the reduction in this year's forecasted gross profit margin versus 2022 reflects 250 to 300 basis points of reduced benefit from FX plus some incremental inflation. SG&amp;A expenses in the fourth quarter decreased 3% over the prior year to $411 million or 30.5% of sales, primarily due to the weakening of the euro and the yen against the dollar and partially offset by continued investments in the ongoing build-out of the U.S. TMTT commercial team and our high-touch model for TAVR. We continue to expect full year 2023 SG&amp;A expenses as a percent of sales to be between 29% and 30%. Research and development expenses in the quarter were consistent with the prior year at $232 million, or 17.2% of sales.We continue to expect R&amp;D expenses in 2023 to be between 17% and 18% of sales as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT growth. Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 13.3% and or 14%, excluding the impact of special items. We continue to expect our 2023 tax rate, excluding special items, to be 13% to 17%. Foreign exchange rates decreased fourth quarter reported sales growth by six percentage points or $73 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect approximately flat year-over-year impact from foreign exchange to full year 2023 sales. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted our fourth quarter gross margin by 230 basis points compared to the prior year.Relative to our October guidance, FX rates had a minimal impact on fourth quarter earnings per share. Finally, before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of the end of the year. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $214 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $283 million, less capital spending of $69 million. In 2023, we expect free cash flow to grow to $1.0 billion to $1.4 billion.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at 1.37 billion   The adjusted EPS is expected in the band of 58 to 64 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 59 centsOur TakeEdwards Lifesciences exited the fourth quarter of 2022 on a bullish note with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company also registered year-over-year growth on both fronts. The company’s TMTT segment registered strong growth driven by the continued adoption of the PASCAL platform in Europe.  During the quarter, the company initiated the launch of PASCAL platform in the United States. Further, the growth within Surgical Structural Heart was lifted by increased adoption of the company's premium RESILIA technologies around the world, including the recent launch of the company's MITRIS surgical mitral valve. Moreover, the expansion of both margins is encouraging. However, during the quarter, TAVR procedure volumes were impacted by the U.S. hospital staffing constraints and the holiday season slowdown. The choppy market conditions due to the continued foreign exchange impact and stiff competition within the medical device industry remain a concern.Zacks Rank and Upcoming ReleasesEdwards Lifesciences currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

If you want to see more top performing consumer staples stocks in January, go directly to 5 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January.Demand for many consumer staples does not change that much in the near term.While economic conditions might deteriorate, the overall demand for food will remain largely the same or increase as the population increases.Similarly, the overall demand for essential consumer products like toothpaste or detergent will not change very much despite changes in economic condition. Because toothpaste or detergent are considered essential and don't cost very much, many consumers keep buying the products and cut spending on more expensive and not as needed products in more difficult economic times.Individual Company Demand Can Change More Than the Overall Sector DemandWhile the overall demand for many consumer goods might not change as much, the individual demand for consumer good companies does change more frequently and sometimes quite substantially.If a competitor does a good job in terms of marketing, a leading consumer staple might lose market share and it might not make as much profit as the market expects.If the leading consumer staple does a good job in terms of launching new products or growing in new emerging markets, it could potentially make more profit than what the market expects even though the overall demand for a consumer staple remains largely the same.If there is a lot of inflation like what has occurred in 2022, some of the more premium consumer staples brands might not sell as much as consumers downgrade to cheaper alternatives to save money.Consumer Staples ETFIn terms of the consumer staples ETFs, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) ""seeks to provide an effective representation of the consumer staples sector of the S&amp;P 500 Index."" Specifically the ETF, ""seeks to provide precise exposure to companies from the food and staples retailing, beverage, food product, tobacco, household product and personal product industries in the U.S.""Story continuesIn terms of the ETF's characteristics as of January 30, 2023, The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) has a weighted price to earnings ratio of 20.97, a weighted price to book ratio of 5.44 and an est. 3-5 year EPS growth rate of 6.74%.The ETF has an inception date of December 16, 1998 and a gross expense ratio of 0.10%.Because many leading consumer staple stocks are dividend stocks given their relatively stable businesses, The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) has a 30 Day SEC yield of 2.55%.S&amp;P 500 Performance in JanuaryIn terms of January, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied 6.6% in the month as fourth quarter U.S. GDP growth has been stronger than expected and as inflation has shown signs of having potentially peaked last year.Given the Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates further this year, however, stocks could decline if economic data doesn't meet estimates. As a result it could be a good idea to have a well diversified portfolio of blue chip stocks across many different sectors.Niloo / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January, we took the 33 holdings of The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) as of January 30.Of the stocks, we took the top 12 performing in terms of year to date performance as of January 31 according to Finviz.com.Given the leading consumer staple stocks aren't usually very volatile, many of the top 12 performing stocks have not exceeded the S&amp;P 500's 6.6% rally in January. In fact the 12 listed are the only 12 that are positive year to date as of 1/31 among the 33 holdings.12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January12. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 0.11%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is a leading grocery chain whose stock has increased by around 0.11% this year as of January 31. Although 0.11% isn't very good, the performance nevertheless ranks the stock #12 on our list of 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January given many other stocks in the sector are lower year to date.The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is currently trying to get regulatory approval to complete its purchase of Albertsons which would give the company more scale and bargaining power if the deal successfully closes. Currently, the companies hope the merger will successfully complete in 2024.Alongside The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is a top performing consumer staple in January.11. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 0.31%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) is a leading consumer staple with a portfolio of well known brands such as Arm &amp; Hammer and OxiClean. While Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) shares have increased 0.31% in January, they are still down 21.5% in the last year as inflation has been challenging for demand. In Q3, the company's organic sales declined 0.7% year over year due to a volume decline of 8.5%, partially offset by positive pricing of 7.8%. If inflation normalizes in the long term, however, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) could have more growth potential.10. SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 1.32%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY) has rallied 1.32% year to date as of the end of January as the leading food distribution company's valuation has improved slightly given the higher S&amp;P 500. Considering many investors own the stock for its dividend yield of 2.53%, the stock's valuation has decreased as interest rates have increased substantially in 2022.If interest rates normalize in the long term, there's potential for SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY) to potentially gain a higher valuation if it maintains its earnings growth. When interest rates normalize is up for debate, however, as many think it could be at least several years. SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY) ranks #10 on our list of 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January.9. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 1.47%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Leading discount retailer Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stock has approximately doubled since the beginning of 2013 given the company's organic growth and shares have rallied 1.47% in the month of January as company has benefited from the rise in inflation in 2022 with more customers shopping at its stores. Although inflation is expected to decrease this year, it is still expected to be higher than normal and that would offer more opportunity for Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to continue to increase its sales from that route. Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 68 owned shares of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) at the end of Q3.8. Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 2.06%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) is a leading beer company whose shares have rallied 2.06% in January. For its third quarter, the company's net sales rose 4% year over year and its adjusted income before income taxes declined 5% year over year. In terms of constant currency, however, net sales increased 7.9% year over year and adjusted income before income taxes rose 0.5% year over year. The rise was Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP)'s sixth consecutive quarter of top line growth on a constant currency basis.7. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 2.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) has been one of the best performing consumer staples in the last two decades as both the company's sales and EPS have increased given the company's strong branding. In January, the leading energy drink maker rallied another 2.51% as the market remains optimistic on the company's future EPS growth potential. In terms of consensus estimates, analysts estimate Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) will earn $2.31 per share in 2022, $3.04 per share in 2023, and $3.59 per share in 2024.6. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 2.99%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) shares increased 2.99% in January as the cooling inflation data in the past few months might have caused some capital to rotate back into leading dividend stocks. In terms of its dividend, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) has a dividend yield of around 4.87%. If interest rates don't rise too much further, leading dividend stocks could be more attractive if they maintain their earnings growth. Just how far interest rates will increase depends on the Federal Reserve and economic data, however, and not current market estimates.Like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) are among the top performing consumer staple stocks in January.Click to continue reading and see 5 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January.Suggested articles:15 Most Innovative Countries in the World15 Most Valuable Silicon Valley Companies in the World25 Highest Paid Athletes of All TimeDisclosure: None. 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to see more companies in this selection, check out 5 Most Valuable Retail Companies In The World. Retailers are facing challenges due to the rapid changes happening in the industry. Only a small portion of executives are confident about increasing profits in the upcoming year. Most expect inflation to affect their margins and anticipate a decrease in consumer spending due to financial worries. Despite the challenges, retailers have developed resilience in recent years. The pandemic caused significant changes in consumer demand, which led retailers to modernize their systems to better adapt to these changes. This includes improved analytics and strategies to maintain customer loyalty in response to changing consumer preferences.The Retail Industry: An AnalysisAccording to Deloitte, retail sales growth is expected to be limited by a slowing economy. In a baseline scenario with a 55% chance of happening, GDP growth is predicted to decrease from 2% in 2022 to 0.9% in 2023. Although a strong labor market will continue to drive sales, there is a risk of a recession which could lead to economic contraction and higher unemployment.Physical retail stores and online platforms are becoming important sources of advertising for vendors. Retailers are earning more revenue by selling marketing space to vendors, which strengthens their partnerships. The sale of advertising space on websites, in-store displays, mobile apps, and streaming services is expected to increase among retailers, with the greatest growth coming from streaming TV.The top retailers in the US are at the forefront of maximizing retail media networks. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was quick to use its acquisition of Thursday Night Football streaming to sell advertising space to vendors and enhance its marketing. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)’s partnership with Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU) to sell commercials on the ad-supported CTV will become even stronger if its potential merger with Albertsons goes ahead. Similarly, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has a long history of working with vendors on retail media networks and has created its own network called Walmart Connect, which generated over $2 billion in revenue in 2021. The growth of advertising revenue, excluding website placements, is expected to increase 38% in 2023, reaching $6.5 billion. The growth of social commerce offers a new opportunity for retailers and brands. Story continuesIn addition to exploring the most valuable retail companies in the world, investors can also check out 15 Internet Retail Stocks To Buy, 10 Best Retail Stocks To Buy Now, and Largest Retailers in the US. Our Methodology We used stock screeners to identify the most valuable retail companies in the world based on market capitalization as of January 31, 2023.

(NYSE:TJX) in its fourth quarter 2022 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the Consumer Discretionary sector was the largest positive contributor to our relative performance, in part driven by contributions from The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX). TJX is a leading off-price apparel and home goods retailer. After a couple of years of bumpy performance due to closing stores during the height of the pandemic and absorbing rising supply chain costs, sales and margins have reverted towards more normal levels. We believe TJX’s consumer value proposition remains terrific and they will continue to gobble up market share from department stores over the long term.”10. JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD)Market Capitalization as of January 31: $107.288 BillionJD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) was incorporated in 2006 and is headquartered in Beijing, the People's Republic of China. It is an internet retail company that offers consumer electronics products, home appliances, household items, and general merchandise products. JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) is a leading B2C e-commerce company in China and is expected to see significant growth in the industry which is projected to increase by 21% between 2022 to 2025. JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) is one of the most valuable retail companies worldwide. Here is what Argosy Investors has to say about JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We sold JD as a result of the furor over Chinese stocks during the quarter. We had been concerned about China’s lack of respect for investor rights for some time, and Beijing has become significantly more aggressive in asserting itself of late. In addition, the legal structure Chinese companies use to come public in the U.S., a Cayman Islands shell corporation leaves American investors with an unsure path to recovering value should these companies cease to trade on U.S. exchanges. Because of the uncertainty, we exited our position in JD completely. We still love JD’s long-term prospects, but we cannot estimate the legal/regulatory risk associated with these companies anymore. More broadly, we are freeing up cash for some other positions we already own which have declined in this market, and after additional review, remain attractive.”9. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Market Capitalization as of January 31: $115.255 BillionCVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) was founded in 1963 and is headquartered in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. It is a health services provider that operates through Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, and ​​Retail/LTC segments. The company's Retail/LTC segment sells prescription and over-the-counter drugs, consumer health and beauty products, and personal care products. The company was priorly known as CVS Caremark Corporation and changed its name to CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in September 2014. Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”8.

(NYSE:NKE) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Adobe and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) were solid performers in the quarter as some of the doom and gloom narratives around these companies have waned as they both saw strong recent business results. Nike has been dealing with weak demand in China (mostly due to rolling COVID lockdowns) but also a bloated inventory position in North American apparel as well. Supply chain issues caused delays in last year’s inventory shipments. As those were overcome, newer orders came in earlier than expected causing the spike in inventory. On its most recent earnings call, it became clear to us that this inventory spike is a temporary supply issue and narrowly focused in apparel. Demand for Nike products is strong, especially for footwear where nearly every geography grew over 30% in constant currencies in the past quarter. The company expects the inventory issue to be largely behind it in the next two to three quarters and is already seeing inventory levels decline sequentially.”6.

The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly.

(NYSE:UAA) institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/following-33-decline-over-last-120446041.html,1675339486,STORY,['UAA'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 67% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors would appreciate the 7.8% increase in share prices last week, given their one-year returns have been disappointing at 33%.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Under Armour. Check out our latest analysis for Under Armour ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Under Armour?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Under Armour already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Under Armour's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Under Armour is not owned by hedge funds. From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Kevin Plank (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 15% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.3% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 16 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Under ArmourThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Under Armour, Inc.. Insiders own US$850m worth of shares in the US$5.4b company. That's quite meaningful. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 17% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

54,032699c0-c895-33d2-bc76-2e08ab0a4907,UAA,2023-02-02,Analysts Estimate Under Armour (UAA) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-under-armour-uaa-150003496.html,1675263603,STORY,"['UAA', 'DLA']","[Under Armour (UAA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 8, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis sports apparel company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -35.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.55 billion, up 1.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.62% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Under Armour?For Under Armour, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.08%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Under Armour will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Under Armour would post earnings of $0.16 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.20, delivering a surprise of +25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Under Armour doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Textile - Apparel industry, Delta Apparel (DLA) is soon expected to post loss of $0.54 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -205.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $106 million, down 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Delta Apparel has been revised 155.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Delta Apparel will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 8, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis casino and resort operator is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.63 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1458.3%.Revenues are expected to be $3.31 billion, up 8.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4580% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MGM?For MGM, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +7.95%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that MGM will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that MGM would post earnings of $0.22 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.39, delivering a surprise of -731.82%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.MGM appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MetLife believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding for MetLife and its investors of MetLife's performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Segment-specific financial measures are calculated using only the portion of consolidated results attributable to that specific segment.The following non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP:Non-GAAP financial measures:Comparable GAAP financial measures:(i)total adjusted revenues;(i)total revenues;(ii)total adjusted expenses;(ii)total expenses;(iii)adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues;(iii)premiums, fees and other revenues;(iv)adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding PRT;(iv)premiums, fees and other revenues;(v)adjusted net investment income;(v)net investment income;(vi)adjusted capitalization of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC);(vi)capitalization of DAC;(vii)adjusted earnings available to common shareholders;(vii)net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders;(viii)adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding total notable items;(viii)net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders;(ix)adjusted earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share;(ix)net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders per diluted common share;(x)adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding total notable items, per diluted common share;(x)net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders per diluted common share;(xi)adjusted return on equity;(xi)return on equity;(xii)adjusted return on equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA;(xii)return on equity;(xiii)adjusted return on equity, excluding total notable items (excludes AOCI other than FCTA);(xiii)return on equity;(xiv)adjusted tangible return on equity;(xiv)return on equity;(xv)investment portfolio gains (losses);(xv)net investment gains (losses);(xvi)derivative gains (losses);(xvi)net derivative gains (losses);(xvii)total MetLife, Inc.’s tangible common stockholders’ equity;(xvii)total MetLife, Inc.’s stockholders’ equity;(xviii)total MetLife, Inc.’s tangible common stockholders’ equity, excluding total notable items;(xviii)total MetLife, Inc.’s stockholders’ equity;(xix)total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA;(xix)total MetLife, Inc.’s stockholders’ equity;(xx)total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding total notable items (excludes AOCI other than FCTA);(xx)total MetLife, Inc.’s stockholders’ equity;(xxi)book value per common share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA;(xxi)book value per common share;(xxii)book value per common share - tangible common stockholders' equity;(xxii)book value per common share;(xxiii)free cash flow of all holding companies;(xxiii)MetLife, Inc.

Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings and components of, or other financial measures based on, adjusted earnings are also MetLife’s GAAP measures of segment performance. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings are also the measures by which MetLife senior management’s and many other employees’ performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings allow analysis of MetLife's performance relative to its business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results.Adjusted earnings is defined as adjusted revenues less adjusted expenses, net of income tax. Adjusted loss is defined as negative adjusted earnings. Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders is defined as adjusted earnings less preferred stock dividends.Adjusted revenues and adjusted expensesThese financial measures, along with the related adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, focus on our primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of market volatility, which could distort trends, and revenues and costs related to non-core products and certain entities required to be consolidated under GAAP. Also, these measures exclude results of discontinued operations under GAAP and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife but do not meet the discontinued operations criteria under GAAP and are referred to as divested businesses. Divested businesses also include the net impact of transactions with exited businesses that have been eliminated in consolidation under GAAP and costs relating to businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife that do not meet the criteria to be included in results of discontinued operations under GAAP.Adjusted revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) (NIGL) and net derivative gains (losses) (NDGL). Adjusted expenses also excludes goodwill impairments.The following additional adjustments are made to revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating adjusted revenues:Universal life and investment-type product policy fees excludes the amortization of unearned revenue related to NIGL and NDGL (Unearned revenue adjustments) and certain variable annuity guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB) fees (GMIB fees);Net investment income: (i) includes adjustments for earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment (Investment hedge adjustments), (ii) excludes post-tax adjusted earnings adjustments relating to insurance joint ventures accounted for under the equity method (Operating joint venture adjustments), (iii) excludes certain amounts related to contractholder-directed equity securities (Unit-linked contract income), (iv) excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are variable interest entities (VIEs) consolidated under GAAP (Securitization entities income); and (v) includes distributions of profits from certain other limited partnership interests that were previously accounted for under the cost method, but are now accounted for at estimated fair value, where the change in estimated fair value is recognized in NIGL under GAAP (Certain partnership distributions); andOther revenues is adjusted for settlements of foreign currency earnings hedges and excludes fees received in association with services provided under transition service agreements (TSA fees).The following additional adjustments are made to expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating adjusted expenses:Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends excludes: (i) amortization of basis adjustments associated with de-designated fair value hedges of future policy benefits (PBC hedge adjustments), (ii) changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to NIGL and NDGL (PDO adjustments), (iii) inflation-indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation-indexed investments and amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets and other pass-through adjustments (Inflation and pass-through adjustments), (iv) benefits and hedging costs related to GMIBs (GMIB costs), and (v) market value adjustments associated with surrenders or terminations of contracts (Market value adjustments);Interest credited to policyholder account balances includes adjustments for earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment (PAB hedge adjustments) and excludes certain amounts related to net investment income earned on contractholder-directed equity securities (Unit-linked contract costs);Amortization of DAC and value of business acquired (VOBA) excludes amounts related to: (i) NIGL and NDGL, (ii) GMIB fees and GMIB costs and (iii) Market value adjustments;Amortization of negative VOBA excludes amounts related to Market value adjustments;Interest expense on debt excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP (Securitization entities debt expense); andOther expenses excludes: (i) noncontrolling interests, (ii) implementation of new insurance regulatory requirements costs (Regulatory implementation costs), and (iii) acquisition, integration and other costs. Other expenses includes TSA fees.Adjusted earnings also excludes the recognition of certain contingent assets and liabilities that could not be recognized at acquisition or adjusted for during the measurement period under GAAP business combination accounting guidance.The tax impact of the adjustments mentioned above are calculated net of the U.S. or foreign statutory tax rate, which could differ from MetLife’s effective tax rate. Additionally, the provision for income tax (expense) benefit also includes the impact related to the timing of certain tax credits, as well as certain tax reforms.In addition, adjusted earnings available to common shareholders excludes the impact of preferred stock redemption premium, which is reported as a reduction to net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders.Investment portfolio gains (losses) and derivative gains (losses)These are measures of investment and hedging activity. Investment portfolio gains (losses) principally excludes amounts that are reported within net investment gains (losses) but do not relate to the performance of the investment portfolio, such as gains (losses) on sales and divestitures of businesses, as well as investment portfolio gains (losses) of divested businesses. Derivative gains (losses) principally excludes earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives, where such derivatives are either hedges of investments or are used to replicate certain investments, and where such derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. This earned income and amortization of premium is reported within adjusted earnings and not within derivative gains (losses).Return on equity, allocated equity, tangible equity and related measuresTotal MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA: total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding net unrealized investment gains (losses) and defined benefit plans adjustment components of AOCI, net of income tax.Total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding total notable items (excludes AOCI other than FCTA): total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding net unrealized investment gains (losses), defined benefit plans adjustment components of AOCI and total notable items, net of income tax.Return on MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity: net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc.’s average common stockholders’ equity.Adjusted return on MetLife, Inc.'s common stockholders' equity: adjusted earnings available to common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc.'s average common stockholders' equity.Adjusted return on MetLife, Inc.'s common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA: adjusted earnings available to common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc.'s average common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA.Adjusted return on MetLife, Inc.'s common stockholders' equity, excluding total notable items (excludes AOCI other than FCTA): adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding total notable items, divided by MetLife, Inc.'s average common stockholders' equity, excluding total notable items (excludes AOCI other than FCTA).Allocated equity: portion of MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity that management allocates to each of its segments and sub-segments based on local capital requirements and economic capital. Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. MetLife management periodically reviews this model to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards and the local capital requirements; allocated equity may be adjusted if warranted by such review. Allocated equity excludes the impact of AOCI other than FCTA.Adjusted return on allocated equity: adjusted earnings available to common shareholders divided by allocated equity.

Mortgage loans (including commercial, agricultural and residential) and real estate and real estate joint ventures included in Asia GA AUM (at net asset value, net of deduction for encumbering debt) have been adjusted from carrying value to estimated fair value. At the segment level, intersegment balances (intercompany activity, primarily related to investments in subsidiaries, that eliminate at the MetLife consolidated level) are excluded from Asia GA AUM.Asia GA AUM (at amortized cost) excludes the following adjustments: (i) unrealized gain (loss) on investments carried at estimated fair value and (ii) adjustments from carrying value to estimated fair value on mortgage loans (including commercial, agricultural and residential) and real estate and real estate joint ventures. Asia GA AUM (at amortized cost) is presented net of related allowance for credit loss.Statistical sales information:U.S.:Group Benefits: calculated using 10% of single premium deposits and 100% of annualized full-year premiums and fees from recurring premium policy sales of all products.Retirement and Income Solutions: calculated using 10% of single premium deposits and 100% of annualized full-year premiums and fees only from recurring premium policy sales of specialized benefit resources and corporate-owned life insurance.Latin America, Asia and EMEA: calculated using 10% of single-premium deposits (mainly from retirement products such as variable annuity, fixed annuity and pensions), 20% of single-premium deposits from credit insurance and 100% of annualized full-year premiums and fees from recurring-premium policy sales of all products (mainly from risk and protection products such as individual life, accident &amp; health and group).Sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, but are used as relevant measures of business activity.The following additional information is relevant to an understanding of MetLife’s performance results and outlook:Volume growth, as discussed in the context of business growth, is the period over period percentage change in adjusted earnings available to common shareholders attributable to adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues and assets under management levels, applying a model in which certain margins and factors are held constant. The most significant of such items are underwriting margins, investment margins, changes in equity market performance, expense margins and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Holding company cash and liquid assets are held by MetLife, Inc. collectively with other MetLife holding companies and include cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and publicly traded securities excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, regulatory deposits, the collateral financing arrangement, funding agreements and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.MetLife uses a measure of free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of its ability to generate cash for reinvestment into its businesses or use in non-mandatory capital actions. MetLife defines free cash flow as the sum of cash available at MetLife’s holding companies from dividends from operating subsidiaries, expenses and other net flows of the holding companies (including capital contributions to subsidiaries), and net contributions from debt to be at or below target leverage ratios. This measure of free cash flow is prior to capital actions, such as common stock dividends and repurchases, debt reduction and mergers and acquisitions. Free cash flow should not be viewed as a substitute for net cash provided by (used in) operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP. The free cash flow ratio is typically expressed as a percentage of annual adjusted earnings available to common shareholders.Notable items reflect the unexpected impact of events that affect MetLife’s results, but that were unknown and that MetLife could not anticipate when it devised its business plan. Notable items also include certain items regardless of the extent anticipated in the business plan, to help investors have a better understanding of MetLife's results and to evaluate and forecast those results. Notable items represent a positive (negative) impact to adjusted earnings available to common shareholders.We refer to observable forward yield curves as of a particular date in connection with making our estimates for future results. The observable forward yield curves at a given time are based on implied future interest rates along a range of interest rate durations. This includes the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate which we use as a benchmark rate to describe longer-term interest rates used in our estimates for future results.Not Meaningful (NM) indicates a percentage change in a financial metric over a specified period of time and reflects changes in factors that are subject to volatility, and should not, accordingly be viewed as representative of a reasonable trend currently or in the future.

As the price spread between Australian and European coal is wide, Japanese companies plan to increase imports from South Africa, a Tokyo-based coal trader said.""We are looking into diversifying supply sources in areas (outside of Australia) such as Africa and South America,"" Kazuhiro Ikebe, president of Kyushu Electric, said last month.JERA, Japan's biggest power generator, has modified some equipment at its coal power plants so that it can burn a wider variety of coal, which has already helped bring down the fuel cost by about 26 billion yen ($202 million) in the nine months ended Dec. 31, Tetsuo Yoshida, the head of finance, said.Hokuriku Electric Power, which like other Japanese utilities posted a record net loss in the nine month period ended Dec. 31 because of soaring import costs, will continue to seek high-grade coal ""as much as possible,"" a company official said.""But (we) will also use medium-grade coal in which the cost reduction benefit outweighs higher consumption volume and ash handling costs,"" the official added.REPLACING RUSSIACoal imports from Russia have been in sharp decline since mid-2022 and preliminary broker data suggests they have fallen close to zero for February, according to Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group.To replace Russian coal, Japan has increased coal imports from several sources, including Indonesia, Australia, South Africa and even occasional cargoes from the Americas, including Canada, Colombia, and the United States, he said.Japan's biggest coal-fired power generator, Electric Power Development Co Ltd, is considering buying coal from South Africa to diversify procurement sources, a spokesperson said.($1 = 128.4800 yen)(Reporting by Yuka Obayashi; Additional reporting by Katya Golubkova in Riga; Editing by Florence Tan and Jamie Freed)]"

West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) settled at $75.88 a barrel, down 53 cents, or 0.7%.While new orders for U.S. manufactured goods rose broadly in December, orders for industrial equipment and other machinery fell, according to the latest Commerce Department data.""It was highlighting more slowing in the economy, particularly on the industrial side, which is a negative for petroleum,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital.A rebound in the dollar index, which hit a nine-month low earlier in the session on softer U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike bets, also weighed on oil prices, according to Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates. A stronger greenback makes dollar-priced oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.The Fed raised its target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, but continued to promise ""ongoing increases"" in borrowing costs as part of its battle against inflation.""Inflation has eased somewhat but remains elevated,"" the U.S. central bank said in a statement that marked an explicit acknowledgement of the progress made in lowering the pace of price increases from the 40-year highs hit last year.While inflation appears to have slowed in major economies, the response of central banks and the speed of reopening from COVID-19 lockdowns is uncertain.""Investors have become less confident in the strength of the outlook; something we could see change repeatedly in this first quarter due to the lack of visibility on interest rates and China's COVID transition,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.Helping to keep oil from moving lower was a European Union ban on Russian refined products set to take effect on Feb. 5, potentially dealing a blow to global supply.Story continuesEU countries will seek a deal on Friday on a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products after postponing a decision on Wednesday because of divisions among member states, diplomats said.The European Commission proposed last week that from Feb. 5 the EU apply a price cap of $100 a barrel on premium Russian oil products such as diesel and a $45 per barrel cap on discounted products such as fuel oil.Meanwhile, an OPEC+ panel endorsed the producer group's current output policy at a meeting on Wednesday, leaving production cuts agreed last year unchanged amid hopes of higher Chinese demand and uncertain prospects for Russian supply.(Additional reporting by Noah Browning in London;Editing by Marguerita Choy, Will Dunham, Kirsten Donovan and David Gregorio)]"

The greenback tumbled to an over nine-month low against a basket of currencies.A weaker dollar benefits crude markets by making the commodity cheaper for international buyers.Brent oil futures rose 0.2% to $83.16 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 0.5% to $76.84 a barrel by 20:48 ET (01:48 GMT). Both contracts plummeted by as much as $3 on Wednesday, following the Fed decision.Crude markets have struggled so far in 2023 amid persistent concerns over an economic slowdown this year, while uncertainty over a recovery in Chinese demand also weighed.Markets are now awaiting interest rate hikes from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England later in the day. Both banks are expected to hike rates by 50 basis points each and signal more policy tightening- a scenario that increases the chances of a global economic slowdown this year.Fears of a near-term U.S. supply glut dented oil prices this week, as government data showed that U.S. crude stockpiles jumped more than expected to a 20-month high in the week to January 27.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) also kept its production levels unchanged during a meeting on Wednesday, offering little near-term support to prices.Story continuesEconomic data from China offered a mixed view on a recovery in the world’s largest oil importer. While business activity has certainly improved after the country lifted most anti-COVID restrictions earlier this year, private data showed this week that some facets of the economy are still struggling to navigate a spike in COVID-19 cases.The COVID-19 outbreak has also resulted in uncertainty over when the Chinese economy could recovery from a pandemic-driven slump. But a Chinese recovery is still expected to propel crude demand to record highs this year.Related ArticlesOil prices buoyed by dollar weakness as central banks take focusOil prices rise after U.S. Fed hikes rates, weakening the dollarExplainer-Spilt milk?

For more information about Morgan Stanley, please visit www.morganstanley.com.Before investing carefully consider the Fund's objective, risks, charges, and expenses available in the prospectus, please download one at https://www.calvert.com. Read carefully.Risk Considerations:There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in these portfolios. In general, equities securities’ values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Index Related Risk. The return may not track the return of the Index and therefore may not achieve its investment objective. In addition, the Portfolio can be expected to be less correlated with the return of the index. Investing primarily in responsible investments carries the risk that, under certain market conditions, the Portfolio may underperform portfolios that do not utilize a responsible investment strategy. An investment’s ESG performance, or Calvert’s assessment of such performance may change over time, which could cause the Portfolio to temporarily hold securities that do not comply with the Portfolio’s responsible investment criteria.An ESG investment strategy limits the types and number of investment opportunities available to the strategy and, as a result, the strategy may underperform other funds that do not have an ESG focus. Companies selected for inclusion in the strategy may not exhibit positive or favorable ESG characteristics at all times and may shift into and out of favor depending on market and economic conditions.Calvert Research and Management is part of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, the asset management division of Morgan Stanley.

The report showcases the need for organizations to drastically rethink the way they are engaging with stakeholders and provides a guide for brands that want to act more relevantly and authentically to meet the needs of stakeholders in the region.""We've long known that DE&amp;I is not a monolith in the Asia Pacific region, but with this new data we've gained the richest detail we've ever seen about what matters to which populations,"" said Lynne Anne Davis, Asia Pacific regional president, FleishmanHillard. ""From diversity of gender and religion to equity in important economic issues like housing and income, DE&amp;I doesn't look the same in any two markets in the region. It's really important to understand these differences as a brand and as an employer to be able to deliver on these values with a range of stakeholder groups.""The DE&amp;I Decoded: APAC research found:DE&amp;I is important in APAC. Definitions may differ by market, but APAC respondents expect topics, including race, ethnicity and gender to be a central consideration in all communications and business strategies. Fifty-one percent of respondents agreed in the importance of ""making people with different backgrounds more included in society"" versus only 11% who preferred to keep the current societal structures.Economics are a major factor in facilitating change. Across Asia the population is active in advocacy, with 84% noting that they advocate for at least one issue. Economic issues including economic status, employment status and income top the list, followed by more commonly recognized DE&amp;I topics like gender, social status / class, cultural background and religion.Taking decisive action counts. Organizations taking actions on DE&amp;I are being prioritized over those without commitments or plans in APAC today. Ninety-four percent of respondents cited at least one action that companies could take to showcase an authentic commitment to DE&amp;I.Story continues""What we saw in the data is a unique lexicon for DE&amp;I that stakeholders across the business world, governments and beyond can use to build a more equitable and inclusive society,"" said Leela Stake, FleishmanHillard FH4Inclusion lead and co-lead for the True MOSAIC DE&amp;I practice. ""While the language used to discuss these topics differs, the need for change is high. Especially when it comes to the elements needed for all to build a better life – education, income and safety. We saw respondents actively taking a stand and pushing for change in these areas.""Steps organizations need to take around DE&amp;I in APAC:Communicating about DE&amp;I. APAC consumers (90%) expect companies to act and communicate about DE&amp;I; however only 3% of respondents noted that they remember getting information on the topic from their employers.Defining the strategy with actions and goals. Meaningful action starts with a plan and actionable goals. They can be modest to start, but require commitment, communication and transparency.Prioritizing dialogue and education. Rather than one-way communication, organizations need to engage in conversation around DE&amp;I topics and invest in additional training and education. Thirty-six percent of respondents expect employee training on the topic and 83% expect companies to have a DE&amp;I leader.Customizing communications by market. While there's temptation to send a single communication, language used to discuss DE&amp;I varies greatly by market. Communications and plans need to be tailored for each market and speak to the elements of their global DE&amp;I strategy that resonate in that market.""The DE&amp;I Decoded: APAC study's results speak to how high the demand is for brands to take actions related to DE&amp;I,"" said Michael Rinaman, managing director of TRUE Global Intelligence in APAC and global analytics lead at FleishmanHillard. ""Even though priorities are different depending on the population you're speaking with, people in the Asia Pacific region overwhelmingly call for action from governments and from companies to improve society. This may come through training and education, or it may come through DE&amp;I leaders in the region making discrete, actionable plans to improve their organizations and workplaces.""Research for DE&amp;I Decoded: APAC was conducted by TRUE Global Intelligence, FleishmanHillard's in-house research and analytics practice, with survey fielding occurring from September 16-27, 2022. The report is based on a survey of 5,106 people across the APAC region, including population weighted samples for Australia, China, Hong Kong S.A.R., India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. It revealed the unique needs of each market, along with compelling data regarding emerging trends in the region, information about where people consume information about DE&amp;I and how economic equity influences action.About FleishmanHillardFleishmanHillard specializes in public relations, reputation management, public affairs, brand marketing, digital strategy, social engagement and content strategy.

When the company finally said it was laying off 12,000 employees earlier in January, Hohm responded by saying the tech giant didn't go far enough, urging it cut another 25,000 people from its payroll, reel in share-based and executive compensation, and cut salaries, claiming Alphabet pays its average employee $300,000 a year plus benefits.

And Amazon (AMZN) then revealed 18,000 layoffs, although its culture has always been survival of the fittest dating back to founder Jeff Bezos.In November 2022, Meta (META) unveiled 10,000 layoffs.

For more companies, head on over to Top 5 Smartest Companies To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Surviving in the modern day corporate world is not for the faint of heart. Business is a ruthless endeavor, and shareholder and investor interest reign supreme for each company. The companies that have survived, and have turned into modern day giants and/or disrupted industries are ones that have beaten the competition by introducing unique products and services and capturing consumer attention through marketing campaigns. America, which has the largest and most developed corporate sector in the world (even the universe maybe, unless NASA finds aliens), is full of companies that disrupted industries and become corporate giants — even closing in on the African continent's GDP when it comes to market capitalization. Africa's nominal GDP is slated to be $3.14 trillion by 2023 according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), while the two most valuable American firms — Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) — have a combined market capitalization of $4.16 trillion.Both have led the charge and transformed entire industries. For Apple, its biggest strength is the manufacturing supply chain that enables it to pump out millions of iPhones each year. For Microsoft,  it has been the ability to target the highest growing industries and become a dominant player in them. The best example of this is the Azure cloud computing and data center platform, which grew 40% on a YoY basis in the second quarter of 2022.Marcin Balcerzak/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has taken a wager at trying to identify the smartest companies in the world.

I'll now turn the call over to Rob.Rob Fauber : Thanks, Shivani. Good afternoon, and thanks to everybody for joining today's call. I'm going to start with some key takeaways from our 2022 results, and then I'll look ahead to what we're expecting for 2023 before we take your questions. Our fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results demonstrate the positive momentum and resilience of MA; while at the same time, reflecting the impact of challenging market conditions on MIS. And MA had a very strong finish to the year. It delivered its 60th consecutive quarter of growth and 10% ARR growth. Revenue grew 15% for the year; and for the first time, MA's full year adjusted operating margin exceeded 30%, and those are results that achieve the Rule of 40 distinction.MIS generated $2.7 billion in revenue as it weathered a challenging year for issuance, and we continue to advance our ratings franchise to ensure that we're well positioned to capture future issuance growth. And during the fourth quarter, we executed on the expanded expense management program that we announced in October and that's expected to deliver over $200 million in annualized savings in 2023. And it really significantly strengthens our financial position and flexibility for the coming year. Now for the full year 2023, we expect Moody's revenue to grow in the mid- to high single-digit percent range. And in addition, we're maintaining our previously communicated medium-term growth targets with a reset of the base year to 2022. And in what is clearly a fast-paced and ever-evolving landscape, we're investing with intent to grow and scale and to expand our capabilities to deliver on our mission, and that is providing best-in-class integrated perspectives on risk.So turning to our full year financials. Moody's total revenue was $5.5 billion. MA contributed approximately half of our total revenue for the first time in our history. And as I mentioned, MA revenue grew by 15%. And excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, growth would have been 20%. Organic constant dollar growth for both MA revenue and ARR was 10%. And overall, Moody's achieved a 42.6% adjusted operating margin with an adjusted diluted EPS of $8.57. Now moving on. We remain laser focused on the four strategic priorities that I outlined in February of 2021. In order to realize the potential of our global integrated risk assessment strategy, and the success of this strategy has been made possible by our incredibly talented and committed employees.They've helped us launch new products, expand into new markets and improve the experience for our customers. And it's really wonderful to see our collective work achieve a number of important industry awards. For the first time, Moody's earned the top ranking in the Chartis RiskTech100. And we placed ahead of hundreds of companies in the risk and compliance technology space that ranges from household names in our sector to earlier-stage innovators. And it's really a testament to the momentum of our risk assessment strategy and the quality of our portfolio of solutions. And in addition, for the 11th consecutive year, MIS was voted the Best Credit Rating Agency by Institutional Investor and really demonstrates that we remain the clear agency of choice with investors.In MIS, in 2022, we made several important investments to enhance our ratings presence in emerging markets. And that includes the acquisition of our majority stake in the largest domestic rating agency in Africa and the further expansion of Moody's Local in Latin America. We also met the need for greater transparency in ESG risks, specifically as they relate to credit by rolling out more than 10,000 new ESG credit impact scores across MIS. Now across MA, we enhanced a number of our workflow offerings through the integration of data and analytics, and we created new products to meet evolving customer needs. In fact, newly developed organic products contributed a significant portion of MA sales growth in 2022. I'm going to touch on several of these in a few minutes.Turning to the outlook for MIS. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect that the factors that impacted issuance in 2022 to persist really through the first half of 2023. The inflationary environment, the pace of interest rate increases are still causing volatility in equity and debt markets, and the trajectory of economic growth in major economies remains uncertain. So it's going to take some time for these issues to resolve and for debt market activity to fully resume but refunding needs and pent-up issuance demand and baseline economic growth, they all point to a recovery in issuance, which we expect to pick up in the second half of the year. And in this environment, we are proactively balancing our commitment to serve issuers and investors with the highest quality ratings and research and insights; while at the same time, prudently managing cost.one photo/Shutterstock.comAnd we expect that the swift and decisive expense management actions that we took in the fourth quarter will enable MIS' adjusted operating margin to return to the mid-50s percent range in 2023. So moving to MA. I want to highlight the impact of the significant investments that we've made in product development and sales and acquisitions. And over the last three years, these investments have helped us deliver $1 billion in additional recurring revenue. And on an organic constant currency basis, recurring revenue growth has been steadily improving each year from 9.2% in 2020 to 9.7% in 2021 and 11.1% in 2022. And we're well positioned for future growth as three of our businesses with revenue of more than $100 million each delivered ARR growth in excess of 10%.In fact, our KYC and compliance business, which is our fastest-growing business, had ARR growth greater than 20%. And even some of our more established products such as Orbis and CreditView, delivered high single-digit ARR growth last year. So let me give you a little bit of insight into how several of our newly-launched products are contributing to this growth. And I'm going to start with our KYC Lifecycle solution, which offers customers a user-friendly configurable portal and risk engine. And it enables fast and accurate checks that leverage our vast company, people and news data sets. And this solution integrates the capabilities that we've built and acquired over the past several years, so it's opening the door to new markets and customer segments with a powerful new workflow tool for financial crime compliance and third-party due diligence.And it is resonating with our customers. In the fourth quarter, we completed one of our largest-ever sales to a nonfinancial corporate customer in MA with a combined offering supporting both customer and supplier vetting and screening capabilities. We also recently launched an enhanced version of our Climate on Demand product, which integrates our very rich climate analytics from RMS and MA and broadens the scope of our capabilities in the banking and insurance sectors and beyond. And Climate on Demand is part of our growing suite of physical and transition risk offerings, which are gaining traction with our customers. For example, we were awarded an important sales mandate late last year as a major U.S. financial regulator selected us to help them better understand and measure the impact of climate on risks facing financial institutions in the broader economy.And we were selected because of our ability to bring together some unique capabilities from across Moody's, and that includes our ability to quantify the financial impact of climate risk, physical risk assessment of bank operations and exposures as well as finance emissions. And in banking, we extended our CreditLens origination solution into commercial real estate, and that's one of the largest asset classes on bank's balance sheets. And this product integrates our proprietary property data, market forecast and credit analytics to meet the specific needs of commercial real estate lenders. And we're excited to partner on this product with one of the largest real estate lenders in the United States, and we're encouraged by the positive customer feedback and sales progress to date.So together, these examples, I think, demonstrate how we are integrating capabilities, we're driving product innovation and leveraging our very strong sales distribution to build a robust pipeline as a foundation for continued growth. So let me turn to the outlook for 2023, and I want to highlight just a few of our guidance metrics. We project that Moody's revenue will grow in the mid- to high single-digit percent range and adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 44% to 45%. Adjusted diluted EPS is forecast to be in the range of $9 to $9.50. And for the medium term, we're maintaining our previously communicated growth targets with a reset of the base year to 2022. And in summary, we made strong progress in the fourth quarter to position the business for success, closing out what we'd characterize as both a challenging and a productive year.And indeed, against the backdrop of macroeconomic headwinds, we've continued to unlock the growing potential of MA and reinforced the foundation for MIS to capture the immense opportunity we see once issuance levels recover. So we've entered 2023 in a position of strength, and I have tremendous confidence in the growth potential of the business as we continue to execute and invest in building Moody's as the leading provider of integrated perspectives on risk. And with that, Mark and I would be pleased to take your questions.

Meanwhile, the annual decline in new listings also moderated to single digits in January; new listings remain an important indicator of home selling interest, and a sustained improvement would suggest more sellers are returning to the market in the coming months.""Home buying in January remained relatively sluggish as sales slowed, inventories rose, and price growth leveled off. These trends reinforce that while buyers are gaining an advantage in the market, they are still being deterred by high home prices and financing costs,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""Even as inventories climb and prices moderate, homeowners have equity and advantages in the market but need to set their expectations accordingly.

Across the top 100 metros in Q4 2022, 55.5% of listing views on Realtor.com® went to properties located outside of the shoppers' metro area, compared to 55.0% during the previous quarter and 53.4% in the same time last year. Regionally, shoppers in the West (63.0%) and Northeast (57.0%) were mostly likely to search out-of-market last quarter.Story continuesMarkets in the Midwest and Northeast that can offer shoppers more affordable deals gained the most popularity from out-of-market shoppers last quarter, including Pittsburgh; Buffalo, N.Y.; Syracuse, N.Y.; Albany, N.Y.; and Cleveland, Ohio. Markets that saw the greatest decline in out-of-market home shoppers were Austin, Texas; Seattle; Knoxville, Tenn.; Albuquerque, N.M.; and Ogden, Utah. High financial costs likely made Phoenix and Los Angeles less desirable destinations for both local and out-of-metro home shoppers last quarter compared to the prior year, which aligns with Realtor.com®'s 2023 Housing Forecast, which predicted large year-over-years sales declines in those two metros.Gradually cooling markets gives buyers more homes to choose from Nationally, the number of active listings in January continued to climb higher, suggesting that less competition and more time to make home buying decisions weren't enough to spur buyer demand in the face of high mortgage rates and home prices. Pending listings, or homes under contract with a buyer, continued to drop, as did the number of newly listed homes. This month's decline in new listings is the smallest since last July, and the South saw an increase in new listings, which means more, fresh for-sale options for homebuyers.In January, the active inventory of homes for sale grew 65.5% year-over-year in, but is still 43.2% lower than it was before the pandemic (January 2017-2019 average).Both pending listings, or homes under contract with a buyer (-31.9%), and newly-listed homes (-5.4%), declined year-over-year. The decline in new listings is much lower than last month's 21.0% decrease and November's 17.2% decrease and the smallest decline since last July's 6.8% decrease.Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, 49 markets posted yearly active inventory gains in January, led by Nashville, Tenn. (+303.5%), Austin, Texas (+260.4) and Raleigh, N.C. (+254.8%). The only metro to see inventory decline on a year-over-year basis was Hartford, Conn. (-8.0%).On average across the 50 largest metros, only the South saw year-over-year new listings increase in January (+5.4%). Twelve metros saw the number of newly listed homes increase compared to last year, up from only two markets in December, all of these markets were located in the South, with Raleigh, N.C. (+49.0%), Nashville, Tenn. (+45.3%), and Austin, Texas (+24.9%) seeing the greatest increases.Buyers see slower price growth and have more time for decision making on a purchaseIn January, the U.S. median listing price remained unchanged from December. Growth in the typical asking price (+8.1% year over year) also remained little changed from last month, after six months of decelerating price growth, suggesting a potential slowdown in the normalization of prices that could continue as we head further into 2023. As the number of homes for sale continues to rise, sellers were more than twice as likely as last year to reduce the asking price for their home. Homes also spent more time on market than last year, with homes in western metros spending 12 days more on the market compared to pre-pandemic times, but in all other regions homes are still selling more quickly than 2017–2019, on average.The U.S. median listing price was $400,000 in January, up 8.1% year-over-year, which is only a slight change from the December growth rate.The share of homes with price reductions increased from 6.0% in January 2022 to 15.3% this year. This is generally higher than it was before the pandemic, but is still slightly lower than 2019 levels (15.6%).The typical home spent 75 days on the market in January, 13 days longer than last year, but still 16 days faster than 2017–2019, on average.Across the 50 largest U.S. metros, 45 metros saw an increase in time on market compared to the same time last year, with the greatest increases seen in Raleigh, N.C. (+41 days), Las Vegas and Denver (+40 days, respectively). Only three markets saw shrinking time on market, including Richmond, Va. (-20 days), Milwaukee (-8 days), and Buffalo, N.Y.

This compares to earnings of $2.83 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 13.82%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of the Invisalign tooth-straightening system would post earnings of $2.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.36, delivering a surprise of -38.46%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Align Technology , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry, posted revenues of $901.52 million for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.38%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.03 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Align Technology shares have added about 27.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.2%.What's Next for Align Technology?While Align Technology has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Align Technology: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.78 on $902.59 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.83 on $3.75 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Dental Supplies is currently in the top 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, The Cooper Companies (COO), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2023.This surgical and contact lens products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.6%.

We've got three stocks for you. And as you can on your screen, a lot of green. Let's kick it off with Meta. We're looking at gains of just about 18% in extended trading. Revenue very strong for its most recent quarter, beating the Street's estimates, coming in just above $32 billion. Daily active users was also better than expected, just at 2 billion flat. They also announced a $40 billion boost in share buybacks. Ad impressions during the quarter were up 23%.And you're looking at an 18% gain in extended trading. If that holds through tomorrow's trading day, that will be the biggest intraday jump that we have seen since 2013. We know 2022 was a very, very tough year for Meta. Taking a look, though, how the stock has performed year to date, we're looking at gains of just over 27%.Moving on to Align Technology, that stock popping in after-hours trading as well, up just about 15%. EPS and revenue both beating the Street's expectations. If you're not familiar with the company, it's a medical device company. They're the owner of Invisalign, which, of course, has been very popular now for quite some time. The company also okaying a $1 billion buyback.I do want to note that the company did not provide full year revenue guidance. They did cite macroeconomic environment and also continued global challenges here as a reason for that. Year to date, you're looking at gains of just about 33%. But let's take a little bit of a longer term chart here and look at three-month. Three months, they're up still big, up just about 46%.And rounding it out with ELF Beauty, that stock also popping, up just about 11% here after-hours. Certainly looks like people are spending money on cosmetics. ELF Beauty beating the Street's expectations here, boosting its full year EPS and sales forecast, beating on the top and the bottom line. Over the past three months, looking at gains of just about 33%.

(Nasdaq: ALGN), a leading global medical device company that designs, manufactures, and sells the Invisalign® system of clear aligners, iTero™ intraoral scanners, and exocad™ CAD/CAM software for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter (""Q4'22"") and year ended December 31, 2022 (""2022""). Q4'22 total revenues were $901.5 million, up 1.3% sequentially and down 12.6% year-over-year. Q4'22 Clear Aligner revenues were $731.7 million, flat sequentially and down 10.3% year-over-year. Q4'22 Clear Aligner volume was up 1.1% sequentially and down 7.5% year-over-year. Q4'22 Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM Services revenues were $169.9 million, up 7.8% sequentially and down 21.3% year-over-year. Q4’22 Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $13.4 million or 1.8% sequentially and approximately $56.4 million or 7.2% year over year.(1) Q4'22 Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $2.7 million or 1.5% sequentially and approximately $11.2 million or 6.2% year over year.(1) Q4'22 operating income was $112.7 million resulting in an operating margin of 12.5%. Q4'22 operating margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately 0.9 points sequentially and approximately 4.2 points year over year.(1) Q4'22 net income was $41.8 million, or $0.54 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4'22 net income was $134.2 million, or $1.73 per diluted share. (3)Story continuesDuring Q4’22, we incurred a total of $14.3 million of restructuring and other charges, of which $2.9 million was included in cost of net revenues and $11.5 million included in operating expenses. Restructuring and other charges included $8.7 million of severance related costs and $5.6 million of certain lease terminations costs and asset impairments.2022 Clear Aligner revenues of $3.1 billion were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $160.8 million or 5.0% compared to 2021.(1) 2022 Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM Services revenues of $662.1 million were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $33.0 million or 4.7% compared to 2021.(1)In Q4’22, we changed to a long-term projected tax rate in our computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across reporting periods. Our previous methodology for calculating our non-GAAP effective tax rate included certain non-recurring and period-specific items, that produced fluctuating effective tax rates that management does not believe are reflective of the Company's long-term effective tax rate. We have recast all prior periods in 2022 to reflect this change. We did not make any changes to the results reported for 2021 as reflecting the change in methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate was immaterial to our 2021 results. Refer to the section titled ""Recast of Financial Measures for Prior Periods in 2022 for Tax Rate Change"" under Unaudited GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation for further information.Commenting on Align's Q4'22 and 2022 results, Align Technology President and CEO Joe Hogan said, ""Overall, I’m pleased to report fourth quarter results that reflect a more stable environment for doctors and their patients than recent quarters, especially in the Americas and EMEA regions, as well as most APAC markets outside of China. Throughout Q4, trends in consumer interest for orthodontic treatment, patient traffic in doctor’s practices, and iTero™ scanner demos continued to improve. However, the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results was unprecedented and reduced our revenues and margins significantly. Despite the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, Q4 revenues of $901.5 million increased sequentially from Q3, reflecting growth in systems and services as well as a slight increase in clear aligner shipments. This is the first quarter in a year that our total revenues and volumes for both scanners and clear aligners increased sequentially. As we move through 2023, I am cautiously optimistic that we will see continued stability and an improving operating environment, but also recognize that the macroeconomic situation is fragile. Regardless, we remain confident in our large, untapped market opportunity for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry.

As of December 31, 2022, we had $300.0 million available under a revolving line of credit which was amended during Q4'22 to extend the term through 2027. In October 2022, we purchased approximately 848 thousand shares of our common stock at an average price of $188.62 per share through a $200.0 million Accelerated Share Repurchase under our May 13, 2021 $1.0 billion Stock Repurchase Program. We have $250.0 million remaining available for repurchase under this program and we plan to repurchase this remaining amount starting in Q1 2023 through either, or a combination of, open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement, and entirely completing this $1.0 Billion Stock Repurchase Program in Q2 2023.Commenting on Align's 2022 results, Align Technology CFO and EVP Global Finance, John Morici said, ""We remain focused on expanding our technology and industry leadership, while making disciplined investments in our strategic growth drivers. We exited fiscal year 2022 with a strong balance sheet, including $1 billion in cash and investments, a healthy cash flow position and no long-term debt. We are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to succeed the current $1 billion program. This new $1 billion program reflects the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow generation, as well as management’s and our Board's continued confidence in our ability to capitalize on large market opportunities in our target markets and trajectory for growth while concurrently returning capital to our stockholders.""Q4'22 Announcement HighlightsOn October 3, 2022, we announced the latest release of the iTero-exocad Connector™, which integrates iTero™ intraoral camera and Near-infrared imaging (""NIRI"") images within exocad DentalCAD 3.1 Rijeka software. This new integration, introduced at the exocad Insights 2022 event in Mallorca, Spain, is designed to support the goal of a seamless, end-to-end workflow for doctors and lab technicians. It optimizes design and fabrication of highly esthetic restorations by providing the ability for dental professionals to visualize the internal and external structure of teeth.On October 31, 2022, we announced that we entered into a new accelerated stock repurchase agreement with Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. LLC, to repurchase $200 million of our common stock under our May 13, 2021, $1.0 billion Stock Repurchase Program.On November 3, 2022, we announced a strategic collaboration to supply iTero Element™ Flex intraoral scanners to Desktop Labs allowing it to connect general dentist locations with its growing network of premium full-service labs. We noted that the iTero Element Flex intraoral scanner will be the exclusive restorative scanner for Desktop Labs, one of the largest lab networks in the United States.On November 7, 2022, we announced the opening of Align's 2023 Research Award Program to support clinical and scientific dental research in universities across the globe. In 2023, up to $300,000 will be awarded to university faculty for scientific and technological research initiatives to advance patient care in the fields of orthodontics and dentistry. Align Technology’s Research Award Program has funded approximately $2.7 million in research since the program’s inception in 2010.Fiscal 2023 Business OutlookFor 2023, Align provides the following business outlook:We are pleased with our Q4 results and what appears to be a more stable operating environment in North America, EMEA. We are cautiously optimistic for continued stability and improving trends as we move through the year. However, the macroeconomic environment remains fragile and given continued global challenges and uncertainty, we are not providing full year revenue guidance. We would like to see improvements in the operating environment and consumer demand signals, including stability in China before revisiting our approach.At the same time, we are confident in our large, untapped market opportunity for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry and our ability to make progress toward our strategic initiatives. We intend to focus on the things we can control and influence which includes strategic investments in sales, marketing, technology and innovation.For full year 2023, assuming no additional material disruptions or circumstances beyond our control, we anticipate 2023 GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 16% and expect our 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 20%.With this backdrop, for Q1 2023, we anticipate clear aligner volumes to be down sequentially primarily due to weakness in China from COVID, partially offset by some stability from our Americas and EMEA regions. We anticipate clear aligner ASPs to be up from Q4’22 primarily due to higher pricing and favorable foreign exchange rates. We anticipate iTero scanner and services revenue to be down sequentially as the business follows a more typical capital equipment cycle.Taken in total, we expect Q1’23 revenues to be about flat to Q4’22. We expect our Q1’23 GAAP operating margin to be up approximately 1% point from Q4’22 GAAP operating margin and expect our Q1’23 non-GAAP operating margin to be consistent with Q4’22 non-GAAP operating margin, as we continue to make investments in R&amp;D and go-to-market activities.For 2023, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $200 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion.Align Web Cast and Conference CallWe will host a conference call today, February 1, 2023, at 4:30 p.m. ET, 1:30 p.m. PT, to review our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, discuss future operating trends, and our business outlook.

In Q4'22, we changed to a long-term non-GAAP effective tax rate in our computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across reporting periods. Our previous methodology for calculating our non-GAAP effective tax rate included certain non-recurring and period-specific items, that produced fluctuating effective tax rates that management does not believe are reflective of the Company's long-term effective tax rate. We have given effect to this new methodology effective January 1, 2022 and recast prior periods in 2022. No changes have been made to 2021, as reflecting the change in methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate was immaterial to our 2021 results. Unless otherwise indicated, when we refer to non-GAAP financial measures they will exclude the effects of stock-based compensation, amortization of certain acquired intangibles, restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related costs, and arbitration award gain, and associated tax impacts.Our management believes that the use of certain non-GAAP financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our recurring core operating performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of our business.There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures as they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our public disclosures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of our GAAP financial measures to the comparable non-GAAP financial measures included herein and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned ""Unaudited GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation.""About Align Technology, Inc.Align Technology designs and manufactures the Invisalign® system, the most advanced clear aligner system in the world, iTero™ intraoral scanners and services, and exocad™ CAD/CAM software.

(NASDAQ:ALGN) At US$270?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigate-align-technology-inc-nasdaq-171407147.html,1675271647,STORY,['ALGN'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Align Technology’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Align Technology What Is Align Technology Worth?Align Technology appears to be overvalued by 25% at the moment, based on my discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$270 on the market compared to my intrinsic value of $216.14. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Align Technology’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Align Technology generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 57% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Align Technology. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ALGN’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe ALGN should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ALGN for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for ALGN, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft Corp, made it available to the public for free in late November.On Thursday, OpenAI announced a $20 monthly subscription, initially for users in the United States only. It would provide a more stable and faster service as well as the opportunity to try new features first, the company said.Analysts believe the viral launch of ChatGPT will give OpenAI a first-mover advantage against other AI companies.

Wade ruling that had recognized abortion as a constitutional right nationwide.Mifepristone, used in combination with another drug, misoprostol, is approved for abortion within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.In their letters to the pharmacies Wednesday, the attorneys general said that the Comstock Act, a 19th century federal law, expressly prohibits using the mail to send or receive any drug that will “be used or applied for producing abortion.”The Biden administration earlier this month said mailing mifepristone would not violate that law if the sender does not intend for it to be used unlawfully.The attorneys general called this interpretation ""bizarre"" and warned that mailing the drug could violate some states' laws.Mifepristone is currently the subject of multiple lawsuits. Anti-abortion activists are asking a Texas judge to revoke its approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which would effectively pull it off the market. Meanwhile, generic mifepristone manufacturer GenBioPro and a doctor have challenged restrictions on the drug in West Virginia and North Carolina, respectively.

Now, many analysts are keeping a close eye on consumer spending power and sales in China. Brooke DiPalma is here with the details. Hey Brooke.BROOKE DI PALMA: Good morning, Rachelle. Starbucks once again looking to report earnings results Thursday after market closed. Analysts expecting a boost in revenue here, as the US continues to benefit from those higher prices, customization, like the ability to add that pistachio syrup to your coffee, as well as the addition of food to offerings. But as you noted, Starbucks in China, a different story there as the COVID-19-- zero COVID-19 policy comes to an end.Taking a closer look at Bloomberg consensus estimates here, revenue expected to come in at $8.75 billion. It's up nearly 9% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share expect to come in at $0.77, that's up 2.7%.Once again, US same store sales expected to get a boost there, as the US customers seem seemingly unbothered by those price hikes, up nearly 9.26%. International sales brought down by China, down about 13.31% in China in particular.Howard Schultz, interim CEO, expecting to come out as the number one western leader and certainly the number one undisputed leader in the category in China despite the headwinds that they face there. But here in the US, menu pricing, inflation a hot topic that is expected to be on the fiscal first quarter earnings results.Really, Howard Schultz sees it as an affordable luxury here in the US. And last earnings results, Starbucks did, in fact, see that fifth consecutive quarter of larger transactions thanks to those higher prices and customers adding food to their coffee orders.Yahoo Finance asked CFO Rachel Rogerio-- Ruggeri, that is, if she expects price increases this fiscal quarter. And here's what she had to say.Story continuesRACHEL RUGGERI: Our pricing in the past year, in FY '22, was really in response to inflationary pressures. We'll have some of that this year based on annual inflation from moves we made last year. But we expect our pricing to return to actions that are more on a historical level.What we focus on is really, how do we sustain that ticket? Because it isn't just pricing. It's actually volume as well. We've seen our customers purchase more. That's evidenced in attach, increase attach. So we're seeing increased volume.BROOKE DI PALMA: And Rachel went on to say that Starbucks' key competitive advantage is having food and beverage offerings that customers just can't make at home, with innovation as a key tactic. As of last quarter though, the company did raise prices by about 5% over a 12-month period.Now, this report is in fact a look back. But analysts are very bullish here. They expect-- well, rather they have ratings of 15 buys, 19 holds, and only one sell on the Street right now, so going into this quarter quite bullish and some holds there.]"

Learn more at www.parker.com or @parkerhannifin.Note on ReclassificationEffective July 1, 2022, the company began classifying certain expenses, previously classified as cost of sales, as selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&amp;A”) or within other (income) expense, net. During the integration of recently acquired businesses, the company has seen diversity in practice of the classifications of certain expenses, and the reclassification was made to better align the presentation of expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income with management’s internal reporting. The expenses reclassified from cost of sales to SG&amp;A relate to certain administrative activities conducted in production facilities and research and development. Foreign currency transaction expense was also reclassified from cost of sales to other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These reclassifications had no impact on net income, earnings per share, cash flows, segment reporting or the financial position of the Company and were retrospectively applied to all periods presented in the financial tables of this press release.Note on OrdersOrders provide near-term perspective on the company's outlook, particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future quarterly order rates. However, orders are not in themselves an indication of future performance. All comparisons are at constant currency exchange rates, with the prior year restated to the current-year rates. All exclude acquisitions until they can be reflected in both the numerator and denominator, and divestitures. Aerospace comparisons are rolling 12-month average computations. The total Parker orders number is derived from a weighted average of the year-over-year quarterly % change in orders for Diversified Industrial North America and Diversified Industrial International, and the year-over-year 12-month rolling average of orders for the Aerospace Systems Segment.Note on Net IncomeNet income referenced in this press release is equal to net income attributable to common shareholders.Note on Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis press release contains references to non-GAAP financial information including (a) adjusted net income; (b) adjusted earnings per share; (c) adjusted segment operating margins; (d) adjusted segment operating income; (e) EBITDA margin; (f) adjusted EBITDA margin and (g) organic sales growth. The adjusted net income, earnings per share, segment operating margin, adjusted segment operating income and organic sales measures are presented to allow investors and the company to meaningfully evaluate changes in net income, earnings per share and segment operating margins on a comparable basis from period to period. This press release also contains references to EBITDA, EBITDA margin and adjusted EBITDA margin. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Although EBITDA, EBITDA margin and adjusted EBITDA margin are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, we believe that they are useful to an investor in evaluating the results of this quarter versus the prior period. Comparable descriptions of record adjusted results in this release refer only to the period from the first quarter of FY2011 to the periods presented in this release. This period coincides with recast historical financial results provided in association with our FY2014 change in segment reporting. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is included in the financial tables of this press release.Forward-Looking StatementsForward-looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are made based on known events and circumstances at the time of release, and as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen uncertainties and risks.

Our reported Q2 results, as displayed on Slide number 6, include positive case volume growth, continued share gains, strong double-digit sales and earnings growth year-over-year. This included operating income growth across each of our segments, including SYGMA and International. Importantly, gross profit growth this quarter outpaced operating expense, an important milestone that we expect to continue into the remainder of the year as we make progress in further improving our supply chain productivity. In addition, we continue to advance forward our Recipe for Growth strategy with continued progress in our digital tools, supply chain investments in sales and merchandising initiatives.The progress that we are making will enable Sysco to better serve our customers and grow profitably for years to come. As you can see on Chart number 7, we continue to succeed versus the overall industry growing1.35x the market in the first half of 2023. I'll break down the sales momentum versus the market further in a moment. Strong top and bottom line growth was delivered for the quarter with adjusted EPS in Q2 of $0.80. I'd like to provide you with some details on select items that impacted our results for the quarter. The first callout is within case volumes. We leveraged a third party to help with macro forecast of the industry's growth. For the second quarter, the projection was that the industry in total, would realize nearly 5% case growth year-over-year.In Q2, the actual industry case growth rate was only 1%, excluding Sysco. This 400 basis points of case volume variance was significant, especially within the local segment. A contributor to the softer volume result was the reality that the Omicron overlap did not lift the market growth rate in November and December as had been anticipated. With that said, it is important to note that we are seeing stronger volume growth in January. Additionally, a labor dispute that impacted three of our operating sites in the second quarter negatively impacted sales and case volumes during the October and November time frame. To be clear, the overall market growth rate is an industry-wide issue, while the labor dispute was a Sysco-specific challenge. The latter of the two issues is now firmly in the rearview mirror.We will monitor the second half of the year case volume trends very closely and we are taking specific actions to accelerate new customer acquisition in the local segment for the second half of this fiscal year given the softer overall market. In addition to explaining the case volume dynamic, I would like to provide an update on operating expenses. As I mentioned, we are making solid progress with improving operating efficiency and we grew GP at a faster rate than expenses in the quarter, a sign of progress and a trend we expect to continue. We are making progress on improving supply chain productivity and I will discuss that further in a few minutes. With that said, the aforementioned labor dispute had a meaningful impact on our Q2 expenses.During this disruption we prioritized deliveries for essential customers, especially in the healthcare and education segments. As a result, we took the actions required to ensure that we could continue operations in these three sites, including leveraging third-party resources when necessary. These customer service measures pressured our expenses for the quarter, negatively impacting operating income. Again, this challenge is in the rearview mirror. On the positive side of the ledger, our contract bid business is exceeding plan on the top and bottom line for the year. Our sales teams are doing an excellent job with customer retention, customer acquisition and profitability management within bid contracts. In addition for our total business, our gross profit per case was strong for the quarter.Our sales and merchandizing teams are doing a solid job with inflation management and strategic sourcing. Additionally, our Sysco brand merchandizing team continues to do good work as we increased Sysco brand case penetration by 65 basis points in the quarter versus the prior year. As you know, each additional Sysco case adds to our profit rate and also positively impacts customer retention. From a sales and margin perspective, we continue to succeed by introducing higher-margin specialty products to our customers and we are winning new business in the higher growth produce segment. The success that we are having in GP per case is expected to continue into the second half of the year and that progress will help offset portions of the market volume softness.Lastly, we are doing a good job of managing expenses at our Global Support Center or corporate expenses putting measures into place mid-Q2 to lower spending in these GSE cost centers. Those measures will stay in place for the remainder of the fiscal year to offset the lower marketplace growth and to mitigate a potential future recession. Turning to the second half, we remain resolute on continuing to drive profitable share gains and drive supply chain operations efficiency improvements. On the operating side of the business, we are making progress on improving our productivity. We are delivering improved retention rates and as a result, lower hiring rates. By hiring fewer people, we have been able to lower recruitment expenses, lower training expenses, and we are seeing increased productivity across warehouse and transportation roles.These improvements will accelerate into the second half of the year. We are fully staffed domestically and internationally and we have detailed work in place to ensure our staffing levels match our daily, weekly and monthly volumes. Q3 is typically the softest volume quarter of the year. and we are improving our flexibility in managing staff levels to lower volume periods, all while preparing for the highest volume quarter of the year,Q4. These staffing planning efforts are built into our year-to-go forecast. There are four factors that influence our full year guidance. Number one, softer than originally budgeted market volumes in the local segment, partially offset by Sysco growing 1.35 times faster than the market in total; number two, higher than originally planned operating expenses, while steadily improving; number three, favorable GP per case and strong margin management; number four, favorable GSE or corporate expenses.Given that we are now at the midpoint of the year and based upon the factors I just covered, we are adjusting our full year guidance. The full year is now guided to be a $0.15 range from $4 to $4.15, which represents year-over-year growth of approximately 23% to 28%, lapping the 126% growth from fiscal 2022. The midpoint of 407 represents a 15% growth rate versus 2019 levels. As is my custom on these calls, I plan to share a bit more color on a few key Sysco initiatives that are driving performance. First, let me start with sales growth. For the first half of the year, Sysco grew 1.35 times the industry and we are on track to deliver our sales growth goal for the year. Our Recipe for Growth strategy is winning in the marketplace. We are seeing solid growth in national restaurants, healthcare and our education segments.At the local level, we are winning business through our specialty programs: Produce, protein and Italian and through our customer growth initiatives, Sysco Your Way and Perks. Altogether, these sales wins are delivering compelling share gains. In the most recent quarter, we advanced dozens of additional Sysco Your Way neighborhoods, introduced Sysco Perks to thousands of customers and began the integration of our latest Italian acquisition in Southern California. The Italian distributor we acquired in Los Angeles, Concord Foods will be converted to the Greco business model shortly. We are planning for compelling sales and profit growth from that acquisition located in the second largest Italian markets in the country. We will continue to expand the Greco platform across the country through a combination of both organic and inorganic activities.Topic two for today I'd like to discuss the state of our supply chain and highlight the status of some important work. I'll start by discussing our core operations environment and then I will highlight some of our strategic initiatives. During the first quarter of 2023, we achieved fully staffed status across our network. During the second quarter, we were able to focus on colleague training, productivity and retention. I am pleased to report and shown on Chart 9 that we are making progress on retention and as a result, we will need to hire far fewer colleagues in the second half of this year. We are seeing the green shoots of progress that come from the reality of less hiring, like lower recruitment costs, lower hiring costs, lower training expenses and lower overtime percentages.We are also experiencing improved levels of productivity from our colleagues as they become more skilled in their roles. Our colleague workforce is still inexperienced versus our historical standards and therefore, productivity is still below historical standards. However, we are making solid progress. We expect to make even more progress in the second half, enabling better flow-through from the top to the bottom line. Importantly, we grew gross profit dollars in Q2 at a faster rate than our expenses grew, creating a favorable leverage ratio. We expect to make even more progress in the second half of the fiscal year. From a supply chain strategic initiatives perspective, we continued on our journey to enable profitable sales growth, improved service levels to customers and to be the most efficient distributor within the food service industry.Our omni-channel initiative is now live in our first test region. We are able to share inventory across two Sysco houses and we have enabled the ability to proactively leverage stocking strategies to improve service levels while lowering our overall level of working capital within the region. As I have mentioned previously, this project will help us lower transportation expenses by ensuring that the last mile distribution to a customer comes from the most proximate DC location agnostic of where the inventory is staged or warehoused. Equally importantly, we continue to make progress with six day deliveries. We have moved meaningful business through Saturday delivery, enabling effective day balancing, increased flexibility and increased capacity utilization across each of our now six full shipping days.The progress of this initiative will position us well for the upcoming peak fourth quarter shipping volume and will enable us to continue winning net new business at the national and local levels. We are pleased to have the implementation in the rearview mirror and we are now focused on efficiency leverage and customer acquisition. These two projects are perfect examples of how Sysco is transforming supply chain management within food service distribution. Our supply chain will enable us to grow profitably for years to come. I'll now turn it over to Neil, who will provide additional financial details.Neil Russell: Thank you, Kevin, and hello, everyone. It's good to be with all of you, and I look forward to our ongoing discussions while I am in this interim role. During the second quarter, we delivered solid growth in both top and bottom line results and continued our balanced approach to capital allocation. All important elements of our Recipe for Growth as we further enhance competitive advantages for Sysco. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter results. Sales grew 13.9% with U.S. food service growing at13.7% and continued positive momentum for our International segment, which grew at 17%. Volumes for the U.S. foodservice segment, which includes our Broadline, FreshPoint U.S. produce, U.S. Italian and other specialty businesses, grew 5.2% and local case volumes increased 3.2%.Gross profit for the second quarter increased 15.9% to $3.3 billion versus last year with gross margin improving 29 basis points to 18%. Gross profit dollars per case grew in all four segments versus prior year marking the sixth consecutive quarter of such growth. Our gross profit and margin improvement during the second quarter reflected our ability to continue to effectively manage product inflation, which moderated to 8.3%, down sequentially from 9.7% during the first quarter at the total enterprise level. The improvement in gross profit per case was also driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts as we continue to partner with our suppliers. Overall adjusted operating expenses were $2.7 billion for the quarter or 14.3% of sales, a 33 basis point improvement as a percentage of sales over the same quarter in the prior year.Diet, Food, VegetablePhoto by Anna Pelzer on UnsplashThis quarter included transformation investments of $55 million and new colleague-related productivity costs of $22 million. This is an improvement compared to $63 million of transformational investments and $41 million of productivity costs in the first quarter. Snapback costs were reduced all the way down to zero during the second quarter. We are pleased with the sequential improvement we experienced in both snapback and productivity during the quarter. All four operating segments again showed increases in profitability year-over-year during our second quarter. As seen on Slide 15, adjusted operating income for the enterprise increased by 37.6% versus last year to $682 million. This is the highest adjusted operating income result for the second quarter in Sysco's history.Just a few years ago, our operating income was about one-third of the amount we achieved this year, an important signal of the progress being made at Sysco via our Recipe for Growth. It is worth noting that adjusted operating income for the quarter was generally in line with external expectations. Importantly, as Kevin shared in his introduction, this quarter marked an important milestone as gross profit dollar growth outpaced operating expense growth, illustrating the beginning of the anticipated leverage with more progress expected going forward. For the quarter, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 23.9% to $831 million. We are pleased with the continued top-line growth in the second quarter. Gross profit dollar growth outpaced operating expense growth and each of our segments generated substantial operating income growth.Our results this quarter were also impacted by three items, including: One, the impact of the labor dispute during the quarter at Sysco. We estimate this impacted our results by approximately $26 million during the second quarter. Second, as just mentioned, a continuation of productivity cost of $22 million directly related to the higher volume of new colleagues we hired over the past couple of quarters. The first two items are included in adjusted operating income. The third item was below the operating income line in other income and expense, which showed adjusted expenses up $26 million over the prior year. This increase in expense was primarily due to increased pension expenses, which were a result of higher interest rates. Regarding pension, we also completed a transfer of a portion of our pension liabilities in the second quarter, decreasing Sysco's plan size, risk and overall administrative costs while protecting retirees as they will now be in the hands of an A-rated insurance company.This transaction resulted in a non-cash charge in the second quarter of $315 million. In regard to the balance sheet, our strong investment-grade rated balance sheet remains a competitive advantage for Sysco, and we ended the quarter at three times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. In the first half of the year, we returned $268 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and paid our increased quarterly dividend, in total, returning $766 million to shareholders. As a reminder, specific to our debt, we remain well positioned in the current rising interest rate environment with approximately 95% of Sysco's debt being fixed rate at attractive rates. Let's turn to cash. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations for the quarter was $503 million, a $126 million improvement over the prior year.Net CapEx increased to $284 million as we continue to invest in our Recipe for Growth, particularly with respect to our planned investments in fleet and distribution facilities. Free cash flow increased to $219 million for the quarter. Working capital was a modest use of cash. We continue to monitor our inventory balances, as well as our accounts receivable given the economic environment. We ended the quarter with approximately $500 million in cash on hand and over $3 billion in total liquidity. Lastly, looking ahead to the remainder of the year and beyond, as Kevin mentioned earlier, we are adjusting our full year EPS guidance range to $4 to $4.15 per share for fiscal year 2023. The midpoint of this range reflects our current business plan, including the three items I described earlier.The low end represents a further macroeconomic softness and potential subsequent reduction in food-away-from-home volume demand. The high end of the range represents an improved macro environment or outside Sysco performance. As we look toward the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect further improvements in productivity costs as the prior wave of new hires continues to ramp up in their roles. We also expect the second half of fiscal 2023 to reflect a similar trend of gross profit dollar growth outpacing operating expense growth. Now I would like to provide a brief update on the status of our sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion work at Sysco. We issued our 2022 sustainability report and our DEI report in November. Sustainability is a key ingredient to our recipe for growth strategy to help ensure that we are growing responsibly and purposefully while leading our industry toward a more sustainable future.We are proud of the actions we continue to take to build a more sustainable future for Sysco and for our industry. It is through these actions that during the second quarter, our MSCI ESG rating was upgraded from BBB to A in their latest ratings assessment. This is a reflection of our ongoing work in sustainability across Sysco's three pillars of ESG: People, product and planet. Furthermore, Sysco aspires to create a global culture that is decidedly diverse, equitable and inclusive, one where we foster belonging as we care for one another and connect the world through food and trusted partnerships. Our recently issued DEI report takes a deeper look into our strategic approach to diversity, equity and inclusion at Sysco and our commitment to caring for people.Since accelerating our DEI efforts in early 2020, we've developed a three year road map to guide our DEI journey, as we embed our strategic priorities throughout the business and achieve our DEI goals. Importantly, we recently achieved our current 2025 workforce representation goal and have now established a cross-functional task force to develop new workforce representation goals as we move forward. All of these efforts are consistent with our purpose of connecting the world to share food and care for one another. Both of these reports can be found on sysco.com. The focus on sustainability and DEI is not only the right thing to do, it will also be good for business in the long term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin for his closing remarks.Kevin Hourican: Thank you, Neil. I appreciate all that you are doing for Sysco. As we conclude, I'd like to provide a brief summary on Slide 20. The following are our key takeaways from today's call: Our first half financial performance with a 15% increase in sales and a 26% increase in adjusted EPS displays the progress Sysco is making to win in the marketplace while we are transforming our business for the future. Our profit leverage improved in the second quarter and we expect that ratio to improve further in the second half of this fiscal year. We communicated today several factors that impacted Q2 profit results. Importantly, the labor dispute is behind us and we are making solid progress on improving our operating expenses.On the sales and volume side of the ledger, our core growth initiatives are working as designed and we will focus on winning more new local customers in the second half of the year. Sysco has proven that we can win share when we make it a priority for our sales teams. Encouragingly, January volume growth is off to a strong start. Lastly, Sysco remains deeply committed to our strong and stable balance sheet, disciplined capital allocation and delivering continued returns to our shareholders. Our status as a dividend aristocrat remains a priority and we are proud to carry that distinction going into our 54th year. We look forward to keeping you posted on our progress as a company and look forward to highlighting more about our longer-term initiatives at the CAGNY conference in a few short weeks.Lastly, I'd like to provide a brief update on the status of our CFO search. We are making solid progress. The interest level from highly qualified candidates has been very strong. We have a very compelling pool of talent to choose from and we are progressing along in the evaluation and selection process. I would like to thank Neil for the outstanding job he is doing as our interim CFO. He is a trusted partner and I greatly appreciate his leadership.

If you want to see more top performing consumer staples stocks in January, go directly to 5 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January.Demand for many consumer staples does not change that much in the near term.While economic conditions might deteriorate, the overall demand for food will remain largely the same or increase as the population increases.Similarly, the overall demand for essential consumer products like toothpaste or detergent will not change very much despite changes in economic condition. Because toothpaste or detergent are considered essential and don't cost very much, many consumers keep buying the products and cut spending on more expensive and not as needed products in more difficult economic times.Individual Company Demand Can Change More Than the Overall Sector DemandWhile the overall demand for many consumer goods might not change as much, the individual demand for consumer good companies does change more frequently and sometimes quite substantially.If a competitor does a good job in terms of marketing, a leading consumer staple might lose market share and it might not make as much profit as the market expects.If the leading consumer staple does a good job in terms of launching new products or growing in new emerging markets, it could potentially make more profit than what the market expects even though the overall demand for a consumer staple remains largely the same.If there is a lot of inflation like what has occurred in 2022, some of the more premium consumer staples brands might not sell as much as consumers downgrade to cheaper alternatives to save money.Consumer Staples ETFIn terms of the consumer staples ETFs, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) ""seeks to provide an effective representation of the consumer staples sector of the S&amp;P 500 Index."" Specifically the ETF, ""seeks to provide precise exposure to companies from the food and staples retailing, beverage, food product, tobacco, household product and personal product industries in the U.S.""Story continuesIn terms of the ETF's characteristics as of January 30, 2023, The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) has a weighted price to earnings ratio of 20.97, a weighted price to book ratio of 5.44 and an est. 3-5 year EPS growth rate of 6.74%.The ETF has an inception date of December 16, 1998 and a gross expense ratio of 0.10%.Because many leading consumer staple stocks are dividend stocks given their relatively stable businesses, The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) has a 30 Day SEC yield of 2.55%.S&amp;P 500 Performance in JanuaryIn terms of January, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied 6.6% in the month as fourth quarter U.S. GDP growth has been stronger than expected and as inflation has shown signs of having potentially peaked last year.Given the Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates further this year, however, stocks could decline if economic data doesn't meet estimates. As a result it could be a good idea to have a well diversified portfolio of blue chip stocks across many different sectors.Niloo / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January, we took the 33 holdings of The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) as of January 30.Of the stocks, we took the top 12 performing in terms of year to date performance as of January 31 according to Finviz.com.Given the leading consumer staple stocks aren't usually very volatile, many of the top 12 performing stocks have not exceeded the S&amp;P 500's 6.6% rally in January. In fact the 12 listed are the only 12 that are positive year to date as of 1/31 among the 33 holdings.12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January12. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 0.11%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is a leading grocery chain whose stock has increased by around 0.11% this year as of January 31. Although 0.11% isn't very good, the performance nevertheless ranks the stock #12 on our list of 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January given many other stocks in the sector are lower year to date.The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is currently trying to get regulatory approval to complete its purchase of Albertsons which would give the company more scale and bargaining power if the deal successfully closes. Currently, the companies hope the merger will successfully complete in 2024.Alongside The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is a top performing consumer staple in January.11. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 0.31%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) is a leading consumer staple with a portfolio of well known brands such as Arm &amp; Hammer and OxiClean. While Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) shares have increased 0.31% in January, they are still down 21.5% in the last year as inflation has been challenging for demand. In Q3, the company's organic sales declined 0.7% year over year due to a volume decline of 8.5%, partially offset by positive pricing of 7.8%. If inflation normalizes in the long term, however, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) could have more growth potential.10. SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 1.32%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY) has rallied 1.32% year to date as of the end of January as the leading food distribution company's valuation has improved slightly given the higher S&amp;P 500. Considering many investors own the stock for its dividend yield of 2.53%, the stock's valuation has decreased as interest rates have increased substantially in 2022.If interest rates normalize in the long term, there's potential for SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY) to potentially gain a higher valuation if it maintains its earnings growth. When interest rates normalize is up for debate, however, as many think it could be at least several years. SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY) ranks #10 on our list of 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January.9. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 1.47%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Leading discount retailer Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stock has approximately doubled since the beginning of 2013 given the company's organic growth and shares have rallied 1.47% in the month of January as company has benefited from the rise in inflation in 2022 with more customers shopping at its stores. Although inflation is expected to decrease this year, it is still expected to be higher than normal and that would offer more opportunity for Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to continue to increase its sales from that route. Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 68 owned shares of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) at the end of Q3.8. Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 2.06%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) is a leading beer company whose shares have rallied 2.06% in January. For its third quarter, the company's net sales rose 4% year over year and its adjusted income before income taxes declined 5% year over year. In terms of constant currency, however, net sales increased 7.9% year over year and adjusted income before income taxes rose 0.5% year over year. The rise was Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP)'s sixth consecutive quarter of top line growth on a constant currency basis.7. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 2.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) has been one of the best performing consumer staples in the last two decades as both the company's sales and EPS have increased given the company's strong branding. In January, the leading energy drink maker rallied another 2.51% as the market remains optimistic on the company's future EPS growth potential. In terms of consensus estimates, analysts estimate Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) will earn $2.31 per share in 2022, $3.04 per share in 2023, and $3.59 per share in 2024.6. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 2.99%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) shares increased 2.99% in January as the cooling inflation data in the past few months might have caused some capital to rotate back into leading dividend stocks. In terms of its dividend, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) has a dividend yield of around 4.87%. If interest rates don't rise too much further, leading dividend stocks could be more attractive if they maintain their earnings growth. Just how far interest rates will increase depends on the Federal Reserve and economic data, however, and not current market estimates.Like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) are among the top performing consumer staple stocks in January.Click to continue reading and see 5 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January.Suggested articles:15 Most Innovative Countries in the World15 Most Valuable Silicon Valley Companies in the World25 Highest Paid Athletes of All TimeDisclosure: None. 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Though U.S. stocks have resumed their strength this year on easing inflation and the Fed’s slower rate hike bets, recession worries persist. In such a scenario, dividends are major sources of consistent income for investors though they do not offer dramatic price appreciation. Stocks backed by regular dividends can reduce the volatility of a portfolio and tend to outperform in a choppy market. In particular, focusing on the growth level in this strategy leads to higher returns. Honing in on stocks with a history of dividend growth leads to a healthy portfolio, with a greater scope of capital appreciation, as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields.We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ADM, Agilent Technologies A, Republic Services Inc. RSG, Deere &amp; Company DE and Cardinal Health Inc. CAH — that investors would love to buy this month.Why is Dividend Growth Better?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 21.Here are five of the 21 stocks that fit the bill:Illinois-based Archer-Daniels is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products. ADM delivered an average earnings surprise of 28.07%.Archer-Daniels has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.

124,ebe22ca7-f524-3e67-92ad-ca7111459740,MNST,2023-02-02,12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-top-performing-consumer-staples-191603731.html,1675278963,STORY,['MNST'],"[In this article, we take a look at 12 top performing consumer staples stocks in January. If you want to see more top performing consumer staples stocks in January, go directly to 5 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January.Demand for many consumer staples does not change that much in the near term.While economic conditions might deteriorate, the overall demand for food will remain largely the same or increase as the population increases.Similarly, the overall demand for essential consumer products like toothpaste or detergent will not change very much despite changes in economic condition. Because toothpaste or detergent are considered essential and don't cost very much, many consumers keep buying the products and cut spending on more expensive and not as needed products in more difficult economic times.Individual Company Demand Can Change More Than the Overall Sector DemandWhile the overall demand for many consumer goods might not change as much, the individual demand for consumer good companies does change more frequently and sometimes quite substantially.If a competitor does a good job in terms of marketing, a leading consumer staple might lose market share and it might not make as much profit as the market expects.If the leading consumer staple does a good job in terms of launching new products or growing in new emerging markets, it could potentially make more profit than what the market expects even though the overall demand for a consumer staple remains largely the same.If there is a lot of inflation like what has occurred in 2022, some of the more premium consumer staples brands might not sell as much as consumers downgrade to cheaper alternatives to save money.Consumer Staples ETFIn terms of the consumer staples ETFs, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) ""seeks to provide an effective representation of the consumer staples sector of the S&amp;P 500 Index."" Specifically the ETF, ""seeks to provide precise exposure to companies from the food and staples retailing, beverage, food product, tobacco, household product and personal product industries in the U.S.""Story continuesIn terms of the ETF's characteristics as of January 30, 2023, The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) has a weighted price to earnings ratio of 20.97, a weighted price to book ratio of 5.44 and an est. 3-5 year EPS growth rate of 6.74%.The ETF has an inception date of December 16, 1998 and a gross expense ratio of 0.10%.Because many leading consumer staple stocks are dividend stocks given their relatively stable businesses, The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) has a 30 Day SEC yield of 2.55%.S&amp;P 500 Performance in JanuaryIn terms of January, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied 6.6% in the month as fourth quarter U.S. GDP growth has been stronger than expected and as inflation has shown signs of having potentially peaked last year.Given the Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates further this year, however, stocks could decline if economic data doesn't meet estimates. As a result it could be a good idea to have a well diversified portfolio of blue chip stocks across many different sectors.Niloo / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January, we took the 33 holdings of The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) as of January 30.Of the stocks, we took the top 12 performing in terms of year to date performance as of January 31 according to Finviz.com.Given the leading consumer staple stocks aren't usually very volatile, many of the top 12 performing stocks have not exceeded the S&amp;P 500's 6.6% rally in January. In fact the 12 listed are the only 12 that are positive year to date as of 1/31 among the 33 holdings.12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January12. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 0.11%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is a leading grocery chain whose stock has increased by around 0.11% this year as of January 31. Although 0.11% isn't very good, the performance nevertheless ranks the stock #12 on our list of 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January given many other stocks in the sector are lower year to date.The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is currently trying to get regulatory approval to complete its purchase of Albertsons which would give the company more scale and bargaining power if the deal successfully closes. Currently, the companies hope the merger will successfully complete in 2024.Alongside The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is a top performing consumer staple in January.11. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 0.31%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) is a leading consumer staple with a portfolio of well known brands such as Arm &amp; Hammer and OxiClean. While Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) shares have increased 0.31% in January, they are still down 21.5% in the last year as inflation has been challenging for demand. In Q3, the company's organic sales declined 0.7% year over year due to a volume decline of 8.5%, partially offset by positive pricing of 7.8%. If inflation normalizes in the long term, however, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) could have more growth potential.10. SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 1.32%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY) has rallied 1.32% year to date as of the end of January as the leading food distribution company's valuation has improved slightly given the higher S&amp;P 500. Considering many investors own the stock for its dividend yield of 2.53%, the stock's valuation has decreased as interest rates have increased substantially in 2022.If interest rates normalize in the long term, there's potential for SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY) to potentially gain a higher valuation if it maintains its earnings growth. When interest rates normalize is up for debate, however, as many think it could be at least several years. SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY) ranks #10 on our list of 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January.9. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 1.47%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Leading discount retailer Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stock has approximately doubled since the beginning of 2013 given the company's organic growth and shares have rallied 1.47% in the month of January as company has benefited from the rise in inflation in 2022 with more customers shopping at its stores. Although inflation is expected to decrease this year, it is still expected to be higher than normal and that would offer more opportunity for Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to continue to increase its sales from that route. Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 68 owned shares of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) at the end of Q3.8. Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 2.06%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) is a leading beer company whose shares have rallied 2.06% in January. For its third quarter, the company's net sales rose 4% year over year and its adjusted income before income taxes declined 5% year over year. In terms of constant currency, however, net sales increased 7.9% year over year and adjusted income before income taxes rose 0.5% year over year. The rise was Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP)'s sixth consecutive quarter of top line growth on a constant currency basis.7. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 2.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) has been one of the best performing consumer staples in the last two decades as both the company's sales and EPS have increased given the company's strong branding. In January, the leading energy drink maker rallied another 2.51% as the market remains optimistic on the company's future EPS growth potential. In terms of consensus estimates, analysts estimate Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) will earn $2.31 per share in 2022, $3.04 per share in 2023, and $3.59 per share in 2024.6. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 2.99%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) shares increased 2.99% in January as the cooling inflation data in the past few months might have caused some capital to rotate back into leading dividend stocks. In terms of its dividend, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) has a dividend yield of around 4.87%. If interest rates don't rise too much further, leading dividend stocks could be more attractive if they maintain their earnings growth. Just how far interest rates will increase depends on the Federal Reserve and economic data, however, and not current market estimates.Like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) are among the top performing consumer staple stocks in January.Click to continue reading and see 5 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January.Suggested articles:15 Most Innovative Countries in the World15 Most Valuable Silicon Valley Companies in the World25 Highest Paid Athletes of All TimeDisclosure: None. 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to see more top performing consumer staples stocks in January, go directly to 5 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January.Demand for many consumer staples does not change that much in the near term.While economic conditions might deteriorate, the overall demand for food will remain largely the same or increase as the population increases.Similarly, the overall demand for essential consumer products like toothpaste or detergent will not change very much despite changes in economic condition. Because toothpaste or detergent are considered essential and don't cost very much, many consumers keep buying the products and cut spending on more expensive and not as needed products in more difficult economic times.Individual Company Demand Can Change More Than the Overall Sector DemandWhile the overall demand for many consumer goods might not change as much, the individual demand for consumer good companies does change more frequently and sometimes quite substantially.If a competitor does a good job in terms of marketing, a leading consumer staple might lose market share and it might not make as much profit as the market expects.If the leading consumer staple does a good job in terms of launching new products or growing in new emerging markets, it could potentially make more profit than what the market expects even though the overall demand for a consumer staple remains largely the same.If there is a lot of inflation like what has occurred in 2022, some of the more premium consumer staples brands might not sell as much as consumers downgrade to cheaper alternatives to save money.Consumer Staples ETFIn terms of the consumer staples ETFs, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) ""seeks to provide an effective representation of the consumer staples sector of the S&amp;P 500 Index."" Specifically the ETF, ""seeks to provide precise exposure to companies from the food and staples retailing, beverage, food product, tobacco, household product and personal product industries in the U.S.""Story continuesIn terms of the ETF's characteristics as of January 30, 2023, The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) has a weighted price to earnings ratio of 20.97, a weighted price to book ratio of 5.44 and an est. 3-5 year EPS growth rate of 6.74%.The ETF has an inception date of December 16, 1998 and a gross expense ratio of 0.10%.Because many leading consumer staple stocks are dividend stocks given their relatively stable businesses, The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) has a 30 Day SEC yield of 2.55%.S&amp;P 500 Performance in JanuaryIn terms of January, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied 6.6% in the month as fourth quarter U.S. GDP growth has been stronger than expected and as inflation has shown signs of having potentially peaked last year.Given the Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates further this year, however, stocks could decline if economic data doesn't meet estimates. As a result it could be a good idea to have a well diversified portfolio of blue chip stocks across many different sectors.Niloo / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January, we took the 33 holdings of The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) as of January 30.Of the stocks, we took the top 12 performing in terms of year to date performance as of January 31 according to Finviz.com.Given the leading consumer staple stocks aren't usually very volatile, many of the top 12 performing stocks have not exceeded the S&amp;P 500's 6.6% rally in January. In fact the 12 listed are the only 12 that are positive year to date as of 1/31 among the 33 holdings.12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January12. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 0.11%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is a leading grocery chain whose stock has increased by around 0.11% this year as of January 31. Although 0.11% isn't very good, the performance nevertheless ranks the stock #12 on our list of 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January given many other stocks in the sector are lower year to date.The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is currently trying to get regulatory approval to complete its purchase of Albertsons which would give the company more scale and bargaining power if the deal successfully closes. Currently, the companies hope the merger will successfully complete in 2024.Alongside The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is a top performing consumer staple in January.11. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 0.31%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) is a leading consumer staple with a portfolio of well known brands such as Arm &amp; Hammer and OxiClean. While Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) shares have increased 0.31% in January, they are still down 21.5% in the last year as inflation has been challenging for demand. In Q3, the company's organic sales declined 0.7% year over year due to a volume decline of 8.5%, partially offset by positive pricing of 7.8%. If inflation normalizes in the long term, however, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) could have more growth potential.10. SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 1.32%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY) has rallied 1.32% year to date as of the end of January as the leading food distribution company's valuation has improved slightly given the higher S&amp;P 500. Considering many investors own the stock for its dividend yield of 2.53%, the stock's valuation has decreased as interest rates have increased substantially in 2022.If interest rates normalize in the long term, there's potential for SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY) to potentially gain a higher valuation if it maintains its earnings growth. When interest rates normalize is up for debate, however, as many think it could be at least several years. SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY) ranks #10 on our list of 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January.9. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 1.47%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Leading discount retailer Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stock has approximately doubled since the beginning of 2013 given the company's organic growth and shares have rallied 1.47% in the month of January as company has benefited from the rise in inflation in 2022 with more customers shopping at its stores. Although inflation is expected to decrease this year, it is still expected to be higher than normal and that would offer more opportunity for Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to continue to increase its sales from that route. Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 68 owned shares of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) at the end of Q3.8. Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 2.06%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) is a leading beer company whose shares have rallied 2.06% in January. For its third quarter, the company's net sales rose 4% year over year and its adjusted income before income taxes declined 5% year over year. In terms of constant currency, however, net sales increased 7.9% year over year and adjusted income before income taxes rose 0.5% year over year. The rise was Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP)'s sixth consecutive quarter of top line growth on a constant currency basis.7. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 2.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) has been one of the best performing consumer staples in the last two decades as both the company's sales and EPS have increased given the company's strong branding. In January, the leading energy drink maker rallied another 2.51% as the market remains optimistic on the company's future EPS growth potential. In terms of consensus estimates, analysts estimate Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) will earn $2.31 per share in 2022, $3.04 per share in 2023, and $3.59 per share in 2024.6. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 2.99%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) shares increased 2.99% in January as the cooling inflation data in the past few months might have caused some capital to rotate back into leading dividend stocks. In terms of its dividend, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) has a dividend yield of around 4.87%. If interest rates don't rise too much further, leading dividend stocks could be more attractive if they maintain their earnings growth. Just how far interest rates will increase depends on the Federal Reserve and economic data, however, and not current market estimates.Like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) are among the top performing consumer staple stocks in January.Click to continue reading and see 5 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January.Suggested articles:15 Most Innovative Countries in the World15 Most Valuable Silicon Valley Companies in the World25 Highest Paid Athletes of All TimeDisclosure: None. 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
132,14c524f4-3025-3d2d-84c0-464822c579e7,PM,2023-02-02,Altria (MO) Q4 Earnings Meet Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/altria-mo-q4-earnings-meet-132501683.html,1675257901,STORY,"['MO', 'PM']","[Altria (MO) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.18 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This compares to earnings of $1.09 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this owner of Philip Morris USA, the nation's largest cigarette maker would post earnings of $1.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.28, delivering a surprise of -2.29%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Altria , which belongs to the Zacks Tobacco industry, posted revenues of $5.08 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.57%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.09 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Altria shares have lost about 1.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.2%.What's Next for Altria?While Altria has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Altria: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.18 on $4.9 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.06 on $21.26 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Tobacco is currently in the top 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Philip Morris (PM), is yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on February 9.This seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.4%.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 8. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis toy maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -49.1%.Revenues are expected to be $1.66 billion, down 7.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 36.36% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mattel?For Mattel, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.38%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mattel will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Mattel would post earnings of $0.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.82, delivering a surprise of +12.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Mattel doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsTake-Two Interactive (TTWO), another stock in the Zacks Toys - Games - Hobbies industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.88 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -39.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.44 billion, up 66.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Take-Two has been revised 0.2% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 3.54%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Take-Two will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The conference ID number is 6982101. A slide presentation will accompany the prepared remarks and has been posted on the investor relations section of the Company's website. A replay will be available two hours following the conference call.Use of Non-GAAP Financial InformationThis press release contains information about Aptiv's financial results which are not presented in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, Adjusted Revenue Growth, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share and Cash Flow Before Financing are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Revenue Growth represents the year-over-year change in reported net sales relative to the comparable period, excluding the impact on net sales from currency exchange, commodity movements, acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions. Adjusted Operating Income represents net income before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax (expense) benefit, equity income (loss), net of tax, amortization, restructuring, other acquisition and portfolio project costs, asset impairments, other charges related to the Ukraine/Russia conflict, gains (losses) on business divestitures and other transactions and compensation expense related to acquisitions. Other acquisition and portfolio project costs include costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and to plan and execute product portfolio transformation actions, including business and product acquisitions and divestitures. Adjusted Operating Income margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income as a percentage of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before depreciation and amortization (including asset impairments), interest expense, income tax (expense) benefit, other income (expense), net, equity income (loss), net of tax, restructuring and other special items.Adjusted Net Income represents net income attributable to Aptiv before amortization, restructuring and other special items, including the tax impact thereon. Adjusted Net Income Per Share represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the Adjusted Weighted Average Number of Diluted Shares Outstanding for the period. The Adjusted Weighted Average Number of Diluted Shares Outstanding assumes the application of the if-converted method of share dilution, if not already applied for GAAP purposes of calculating the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Cash Flow Before Financing represents cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus cash provided by (used in) investing activities, adjusted for the purchase price of business acquisitions and other transactions, the cost of significant technology investments and net proceeds from the divestiture of discontinued operations and other significant businesses.Effective on January 1, 2022, the Company now excludes amortization expense of intangible assets from the calculation of Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share. Financial results reported in this release for both the current and historical period have been prepared under this new definition. Outlook information presented above is also calculated under this new definition. The forward-looking non-GAAP measures presented in this release are reconciled under this new definition to their closest GAAP financial measure at the end of this release.Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the Company's financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In particular, management believes Adjusted Revenue Growth, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share and Cash Flow Before Financing are useful measures in assessing the Company's ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes.Such non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the attached supplemental schedules at the end of this press release. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.1Represents global vehicle production weighted to the geographic regions in which the Company generates its revenue (""AWM"").About Aptiv  Aptiv is a global technology company that develops safer, greener and more connected solutions enabling a more sustainable future of mobility.

COVID-19; Diagnostics and Surgical Grow Double-Digits in Constant Currency –– Company Increases Full-Year Revenue and EPS Guidance –MARLBOROUGH, Mass., February 01, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hologic, Inc. (Nasdaq: HOLX) announced today the Company’s financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2022.""In our first quarter of fiscal 2023, each of our base franchises exceeded revenue expectations, while also delivering robust profitability,"" said Steve MacMillan, the Company’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. ""We had a strong start to our fiscal year with double-digit organic revenue growth ex. COVID-19 in our Diagnostics and Surgical businesses, as well as encouraging signs of recovery in our Breast Health business. In addition, we are increasing our full-year fiscal 2023 guidance for both revenue and EPS, highlighting the confidence we have in our businesses despite an uncertain macro environment.""Recent HighlightsRevenue of $1,074.2 million decreased (27.0%) for the quarter, or (25.1%) in constant currency, primarily driven by lower sales of COVID-19 assays and supply chain challenges related to semiconductor chips in our Breast Health business compared to the prior year period. Revenue, however, was significantly higher than the Company’s guidance of $940 to $990 million provided last quarter.Diagnostics revenue decreased (41.2%), or (39.4%) in constant currency, primarily driven by lower sales of COVID-19 assays compared to the prior year period.Excluding COVID-19 revenues, Diagnostics revenue grew 15.8% on an organic, constant currency basis.Molecular Diagnostics revenue declined (47.7%), or (46.4%) in constant currency, primarily driven by lower sales of COVID-19 assays compared to the prior year period.Excluding COVID-19 revenues, Molecular Diagnostics revenue grew 24.5% on an organic, constant currency basis.Breast Health revenue declined (7.0%), or (5.2%) in constant currency, primarily due to lower capital equipment revenue resulting from semiconductor chip shortages. However, performance exceeded expectations, and the Company continues to expect semiconductor chip supply to improve throughout fiscal 2023.Surgical revenue grew 14.7%, or 17.4% in constant currency, with well-rounded performance across the business. Surgical revenue grew 14.7% on an organic constant currency basis.Cash flow from operations remained very strong in the first quarter at $253.4 million. In addition, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares of its stock for $100 million in the quarter.The Company was named to the annual lists of Top Workplaces in both The Boston Globe and The San Diego Union-Tribune, ranking fifth on the list for largest companies in Massachusetts and fourth for large companies in San Diego County.For the 10th consecutive year, the Company was ranked first for Mammography System Performance and Customer Satisfaction by IMV ServiceTrak™ Awards.Story continuesKey financial results for the fiscal first quarter are shown in the table below.GAAPNon-GAAPQ1’23Q1’22ChangeIncrease(Decrease)Q1’23Q1’22ChangeIncrease(Decrease)Revenues$1,074.2$1,471.1(27.0%)$1,074.2$1,471.1(27.0%)Gross Margin57.5%67.0%(950 bps)62.7%72.1%(940 bps)Operating Expenses$355.5$345.03.0%$339.4$333.91.6%Operating Margin24.4%43.6%(1,920 bps)31.1%49.4%(1,830 bps)Net Margin17.4%33.9%(1,650 bps)24.9%37.7%(1,280 bps)Diluted EPS$0.75$1.95(61.5%)$1.07$2.17(50.7%)Throughout this press release, all dollar figures are in millions, except EPS, unless otherwise noted.

Non-GAAP gross margin of 62.7% decreased (940) basis points. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a decline in COVID-19 assay sales compared to the prior year period and lower capital equipment sales due to continued supply chain challenges related to semiconductor chip shortages impacting our Breast Health business.GAAP operating margin of 24.4% decreased (1,920) basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin of 31.1% decreased (1,830) basis points. The decrease in operating margin was primarily due to a decline in COVID-19 assay sales compared to the prior year period and lower capital equipment sales due to continued supply chain challenges related to semiconductor chip shortages impacting our Breast Health business.GAAP net income of $187.4 million decreased (62.5%). Non-GAAP net income of $267.9 million decreased (51.7%). Adjusted non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $361.0 million, a decrease of (52.0%).COVID-19 revenues, which consist of COVID-19 assay revenue of $126.9 million, and other COVID-19 related revenue and revenue from discontinued products of $37.4 million, decreased (72.6%), or (71.8%) in constant currency.Total principal debt outstanding at the end of the first quarter was $2.85 billion. The Company ended the quarter with cash and equivalents of $2.44 billion, and a net leverage ratio (net debt over adjusted EBITDA) of 0.2 times.On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) was 17.8%, a decrease of (1,160) basis points compared to the prior year period.Financial Guidance for the Second Quarter and Full-Year Fiscal 2023""Our fiscal first quarter of 2023 showcased strong revenue performance and profitability to start the year,"" said Karleen Oberton, Hologic’s chief financial officer. ""For the second quarter and the full-year 2023, we continue to expect low double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth ex. COVID-19 in each division.""Hologic’s financial guidance for the second quarter and full year 2023 is shown in the table below. The guidance is based on a full year non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19.0%, and diluted shares outstanding of 251 million for the full year. Constant currency guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates are the same in fiscal 2023 as in fiscal 2022. Organic revenue guidance is in constant currency and excludes the divested Blood Screening business. Revenue from acquired businesses is generally included in organic revenue guidance starting a year after the acquisition. Therefore, in fiscal 2023, Bolder becomes part of organic revenue in the fiscal second quarter, while Biotheranostics, Diagenode, Mobidiag, and Acessa are part of organic revenue for all of fiscal 2023.Current GuidancePrevious GuidanceGuidance $Reported %Increase(Decrease)ConstantCurrency %Increase(Decrease)Organic %Increase(Decrease)Guidance $Fiscal 2023Revenue$3,850 - $4,000(20.8%) to (17.7%)(19.8%) to (16.7%)(19.8%) to (16.7%)$3,700 - $3,900GAAP EPS$2.69 - $2.99(47.6%) to (41.7%)$2.51 - $2.81Non-GAAP EPS$3.55 - $3.85(41.0%) to (36.0%)$3.30 - $3.60Q2 2023Revenue$930 - $980(35.2%) to (31.7%)(34.0%) to (30.5%)(34.0%) to (30.5%)GAAP EPS$0.60 - $0.70(66.7%) to (61.1%)Non-GAAP EPS$0.80 - $0.90(61.4%) to (56.5%)This guidance assumes low double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth ex. COVID-19 in each division for the full-year fiscal 2023.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company has presented the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release: constant currency revenues; organic revenues; organic revenues excluding COVID-19, non-GAAP gross margin; non-GAAP operating expenses; non-GAAP operating margin; non-GAAP effective tax rate; non-GAAP net income; non-GAAP net margin; non-GAAP EPS; and adjusted EBITDA. Organic revenue for the fiscal first quarter of 2023 excludes the divested Blood Screening business, as well as the acquired Bolder business. Revenue from acquired businesses is generally included in organic revenue starting a year after the acquisition. Organic revenue excluding COVID-19 revenues is organic revenue less COVID assay revenue, COVID related sales of instruments, COVID related revenue from Diagenode and Mobidiag, collection kits and ancillaries, as well as license revenue, and revenues from discontinued products. The Company defines its non-GAAP net income, EPS, and other non-GAAP financial measures to exclude, as applicable: (i) the amortization of intangible assets and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; (ii) adjustments to record contingent consideration at fair value; (iii) additional expenses resulting from the purchase accounting adjustment to record inventory at fair value; (iv) restructuring charges, facility closure and consolidation charges (including accelerated depreciation), and costs incurred to integrate acquisitions (including retention, transaction bonuses, legal and professional consulting services); (v) expenses related to the divested Cynosure business incurred subsequent to the disposition date primarily related to indemnification provisions for legal and tax matters; (vi) transaction related expenses for acquisitions; (vii) third-party expenses incurred related to implementing the European MDR/IVDR requirements and obtaining the appropriate approvals for its existing products; (viii) debt extinguishment losses and related transaction costs; (ix) the unrealized (gains) losses on the mark-to-market of foreign currency contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting; (x) litigation settlement charges (benefits) and non-income tax related charges (benefits); (xi) other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments and realized gains and losses resulting from the sale of investments; (xii) the one-time discrete impacts related to internal restructurings and non-operational items; (xiii) other one-time, non-recurring, unusual or infrequent charges, expenses or gains that may not be indicative of the Company's core business results; and (xiv) income taxes related to such adjustments. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as its non-GAAP net income plus net interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense included in its non-GAAP net income.These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's definition of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of Hologic's historical operating results, comparison to competitors' operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Hologic's business.Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables accompanying this release.Conference Call and WebcastHologic’s management will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET today to discuss its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

It may not have been easy to hold on to HOLX for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Hologic's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Hologic's main business drivers.Headquartered in Bedford, MA, Hologic Inc. develops, manufactures, and supplies diagnostics, medical imaging systems and surgical products which cater to the healthcare needs of women.Hologic operates through the following four segments:Diagnostics (55% of total revenues in FY22): With the Gen-Probe acquisition, Hologic currently offers APTIMA family of assays that includes the APTIMA Combo 2 assay, which feature the APTIMA CT and APTIMA GC assays, the APTIMA HPV assay and the APTIMA Trichomonas assay. Other products include the ThinPrep system, primarily used in cytology applications.Breast Health (29% of total revenues in FY22): Products include a broad portfolio of breast imaging and related products and accessories, including digital and film-based mammography systems, computer-aided detection (CAD), breast biopsy guidance systems, minimally invasive breast biopsy and tissue extraction devices and breast brachytherapy products.GYN Surgical (14% of total revenues in FY22): Products include the NovaSure endometrial ablation system – used in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding and the MyoSure hysteroscopic tissue removal system – which allows incision less removal of fibroids and polyps within the uterus.Skeletal Health (2% of total revenues in FY22): This segment includes dual-energy X-ray bone densitometry systems, an ultrasound-based osteoporosis assessment product, and Fluoroscan mini-C arm imaging products.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Hologic a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in February 2013 would be worth $3,413.17, or a 241.32% gain, as of February 1, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.The S&amp;P 500 rose 172.12% and the price of gold increased 11.12% over the same time frame in comparison.Analysts are anticipating more upside for HOLX.Hologic delivered better-than-expected revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Both molecular diagnostics and surgical businesses grew strong. Excluding COVID impact, molecular diagnostics business grew primarily on more assays being run through the company’s expanded Panther installed base. GYN Surgical business grew nearly 9% organically as the company registered procedural volumes return as well as acceleration from the new business lines. In the past year, Hologic has outperformed its industry. However, on a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues were significantly down. The significant decline in COVID-19 assay revenues, along with supply chain challenges related to semiconductor chips in the Breast Health business, dragged total revenues down. The company also reported a contraction in both margins.Shares have gained 7.70% over the past four weeks and there have been 2 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

149,caccf95c-240a-3268-8123-4dbab932cea6,HOLX,2023-02-02,5 Stocks With High ROE to Buy as Equity Markets Hold Promise,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-high-roe-buy-124712009.html,1675255632,STORY,['HOLX'],"[The U.S. equity markets inched up in the past few trading sessions, buoyed by better-than-expected economic growth and healthy earnings performance from hitherto reported companies. The fourth-quarter GDP rose at a 2.9% annualized rate compared with broad-based expectations of 2.8% growth. Consumer spending was up 2.1% in the October-December period, marginally down from 2.3% on a sequential basis as inflationary pressures remain an overhang. The personal consumption expenditure price index increased 3.2%, down from 4.8% recorded in the third quarter. The employment cost index showed compensation increased 1% in the fourth quarter, slightly down from broad-based expectations of a 1.1% rise.The economic indicators aroused hopes that the Fed will likely consider putting the brakes on its aggressive stance against inflation, fueling the stock market rally. The healthy equity market uptick in January portends a relatively robust performance for the full year. Investors widely expect the rally to continue in the short term, forcing the Fed to be more dovish toward the rate hike regime. The Fed had increased its benchmark interest rates by half a percentage point in its last policy meeting to a targeted range between 4.25% and 4.5% and put the “terminal rate” to a target range of 5-5.25%As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Jabil Inc. JBL, Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL, AGNC Investment Corp. AGNC, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Suzano S.A. SUZ are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Story continuesParameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screen:Jabil: Headquartered in St. Petersburg, FL, Jabil is one of the largest global suppliers of electronic manufacturing services.

152,21c26e7e-ba1f-3d74-a5fb-1bb91270475b,NFLX,2023-02-02,Netflix says it used A.I. to draw backgrounds in its latest anime due to a ‘labor shortage.’ Artists aren’t happy,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-says-used-draw-backgrounds-111926320.html,1675336766,STORY,['NFLX'],"[A lot of people are talking about Netflix’s new anime short, titled “The Dog &amp; The Boy,”—but not for the reason the streaming company might have hoped.On Wednesday, the company revealed that the short, developed by WIT Studio, used an artificial intelligence program as part of the creative process.“As an experimental effort to help the anime industry, which has a labor shortage, we used image generation technology for the background images of all three-minute video cuts,” Netflix Japan announced on Twitter on Tuesday.That revelation sparked a strong reaction from artists on social media, who criticized the streaming company for trying to avoid paying human artists and pinning the blame on a shortage of talent.https://twitter.com/Jen_Benben/status/1620863257681743873?s=20u0026t=L1gvGqgjXZk9Tbmpt4WY-wSome social media users quoted a scene from a 2016 documentary about renowned animator Hayao Miyazaki, the director behind films like Spirited Away. Miyazaki, after seeing a demo of A.I.-generated animation, said he was “utterly disgusted,” and called the program “an insult to life itself.”https://twitter.com/janusrose/status/1620860021662949381?s=20u0026t=hj0wWN919aBS0LnuIs5KLQNetflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Studios argue that machine learning and A.I. programs can help them create complicated visual effects much faster than before. Rob Bredow, the chief creative officer for Industrial Light and Magic, claimed at Fortune's Brainstorm A.I. conference in December that A.I. could shave the time taken for ""face-swapping""—like showing a younger Mark Hamill during The Mandalorian's season finale—from weeks to just seconds.Is there a labor shortage in anime?The global market for Japanese anime reached $21 billion in 2021, according to the Association of Japanese Animation. Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train, on its release in 2021, broke U.S. records for the largest opening weekend for a foreign-language film.Story continuesAnd it’s big business for Netflix, with the company’s lead for anime telling The Hollywood Reporter in 2021 that half of its global subscribers watched some anime.Yet there are not enough skilled animators to meet the demand for Japanese cartoons. Anime is a labor-intensive ordeal, with around 200 animators are needed to create a single title, according to Nikkei Asia.George Wada, WIT Studio’s president, told Nikkei Asia last year that the industry’s labor shortage is “a real crisis,” and that the anime boom meant more talent was needed “to keep up with demand.""Yet the industry is also infamous for low pay and overwork. Illustrators could make as little as $200 a month, and even top animators might only get $3,800 in monthly pay, reported the New York Times in 2021. Freelancers at some studios reported working 400 hours a month, going for weeks without a single day off.‘Please draw it yourself’Artists complain that image-generation A.I. programs, like Stable Diffusion, are trained on image datasets scraped from the internet without their consent. They also worry that these programs can then copy their art styles without compensation.Earlier this year, three artists launched a class-action lawsuit against the developers of Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, arguing that the generative A.I. programs were trained on billions of images “with­out the con­sent of the orig­i­nal artists.”Communities in Japan are trying to separate human-authored and A.I.-authored artwork. Last October, Pixiv, a community popular with Japanese artists, said that it would allow users to filter out A.I.-generated work when using the platform. While the platform said it didn’t want to bar A.I. works, entirely, it admitted that “the regulations and ethics discourse haven't kept up with the pace of this transition.”Some creators have tried to discourage their fans from using A.I. “For fan art, please draw it yourself,” Natsuiro Matsuri, a streamer with over a million YouTube subscribers, asked her fans last October. “I didn’t realize how high-quality AI was these days.”https://twitter.com/TLerKevin3126/status/1579658174902435844?s=20u0026t=-FXveqbUhIcXNyJv9z7_3gThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Olympic legend Usain Bolt lost $12 million in savings to a scam.

I think the streamers are going to consolidate.DAVE BRIGGS: Who could consolidate? Who could be the winner?- Well, listen, I, not unlike all other Americans, I'll get, like, 10 streaming services. It's too much, right? So the winner and the one that we've stayed with all along and received a lot of negative press about it is Netflix. I think Netflix is the Kleenex of streaming, bottom line, period. Best run, cash flow, now they're going into advertising-- fantastic. They will be the core, right?I think Disney is going to be part of the core. What happens to Peacock and Paramount+ and all of these others, I think, remains to be seen.

He has a self-claimed net worth of $400 million and dines on gold-flake-covered steaks prepared by a private chef. He reportedly has both a security and public relations team. Oh yeah… he’s also a dog.The handlers of this German shepherd (and good boy) claim he’s the world’s richest dog, even boasting that he bought a $7.5 million mansion in Miami from Madonna, only to later sell it for $29 million. But exactly how much of the mythos that has been created around Gunther is true is questionable—and is now being explored in a new Netflix series.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j3obY76-KkThe official story of Gunther goes like this: He inherited his wealth from his grandfather, Gunther III, who was allegedly left $80 million in 1992 by a German countess named Karlotta Leibenstein, who did not have a living relative. That story, though, seems to have plenty of holes.Fox Business, for instance, says there’s no evidence the countess ever existed. And the Daily Beast says Gunther’s handler, Maurizio Mian, created the story to avoid Italian taxes.Either way, the money is real (though that $400 million figure has been disputed). And its impact on the humans around him is disturbing.Mian, who was reportedly a professor before making Gunther his full-time job, allegedly created a company that hired models to sing and dance for the dog, but it was disbanded after he was accused of conducting ""science experiments"" to study happiness. The Netflix special also details sex parties, Gunther recording an album (“Wild Dog”) and the canine’s ownership in a horse-racing company.It’s a collection of accusations and salaciousness that rivals that of Netflix’s other shockumentary Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness. Only Gunther is a lot more sympathetic than Joe Exotic.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Olympic legend Usain Bolt lost $12 million in savings to a scam.

Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal joins us now with more. Allie, we knew it was coming. Still stings though.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Still stings. We knew it was coming, and now we have the first few details on what this will look like. Netflix updating the FAQ pages for those countries that are already in the midst of this crackdown. So think Chile, Costa Rica, Peru. But the US is right behind them, expected somewhere in Q1. So it's important to see the changes that will be happening to accounts.Number one, Netflix will require users to identify a, quote, ""primary location"" for all accounts that live within the same household. So users will need to sign into the home Wi-Fi of the primary location at least once every 31 days to ensure that their device is not blocked. Now, if someone is traveling or uses a device that's not often connected to that home Wi-Fi, the main account holder will have to verify that device through a temporary code which will grant the device access for seven consecutive days.Now, it's unclear at this point, if you can request multiple temporary codes following that seven-day period. My thought goes to myself who's still on her parents Wi-Fi along with maybe college kids. I would just kind of call up my parents every seven days. Give me this code. That's unclear right now. So I do think there are a few kinks that Netflix will have to work out. For example, if you're an account holder that has multiple homes, how do you identify your primary location?So I'm not anticipating a very smooth-sailing ride here, but Netflix is certainly using all the tools at its disposal to determine which account is associated with that primary location. They said they look at IP addresses, device IDs, account activity to make sure the device signed in is within that primary household. So they're very committed to this, and they're really hoping that, over the long term, this could add to profitability.Story continuesRACHELLE AKUFFO: I'm sure they're probably hoping people get fed up and just end up having their own Netflix accounts given how many of us share our passwords. So in terms of that, though, in terms of monetization, what's the outlook been so far for Netflix's ad-supported tier? Are they gaining more subscribers?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, well, we have some positive news to kick off 2023 on that ad-tier front. According to a report from The Information, Netflix told advertisers that signups for its ad tier doubled in January from December, and that's a sign that this new offering is gaining traction and obviously good news since at the end of last year we saw that the ad tier was reportedly struggling. There were multiple reports that Netflix was failing to meet the estimates that they set out, that they weren't attracting those new users.At the time, analysts seemed to shrug it off. They said this is still early days and that over time the ad tier will gain momentum, which seems to be happening right now. Obviously ad supported coupled with that crackdown on password sharing, that's been seen as a lifeline for Netflix to really get the revenue and the profitability that they want over the long term, especially with all of this competition.So I think moving forward, especially throughout this year, investors are going to be hyper focused on specific details from both of those initiatives to see if Netflix can get it done.RACHELLE AKUFFO: We'll have to see. I know you'll update us on that. Allie Canal there. Thank you so much for that update.]"

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Phillips 66 How Quickly Is Phillips 66 Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Recognition must be given to the that Phillips 66 has grown EPS by 52% per year, over the last three years. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The music to the ears of Phillips 66 shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 0.6% to 5.6% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Phillips 66's forecast profits?Story continuesAre Phillips 66 Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$46b company like Phillips 66. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Holding US$90m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Phillips 66, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m.The Phillips 66 CEO received US$11m in compensation for the year ending December 2021. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Is Phillips 66 Worth Keeping An Eye On?Phillips 66's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. The cherry on top is that insiders own a bucket-load of shares, and the CEO pay seems really quite reasonable. The drastic earnings growth indicates the business is going from strength to strength. Hopefully a trend that continues well into the future. Big growth can make big winners, so the writing on the wall tells us that Phillips 66 is worth considering carefully. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 3 warning signs for Phillips 66 (1 is significant!) that you need to be mindful of.Although Phillips 66 certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine TJX Companies’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies What Is TJX Companies Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 19.33% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy TJX Companies today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $69.07, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Furthermore, TJX Companies’s low beta implies that the stock is less volatile than the wider market.What kind of growth will TJX Companies generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 42% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for TJX Companies. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in TJX’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TJX, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

If you want to see more companies in this selection, check out 5 Most Valuable Retail Companies In The World. Retailers are facing challenges due to the rapid changes happening in the industry. Only a small portion of executives are confident about increasing profits in the upcoming year. Most expect inflation to affect their margins and anticipate a decrease in consumer spending due to financial worries. Despite the challenges, retailers have developed resilience in recent years. The pandemic caused significant changes in consumer demand, which led retailers to modernize their systems to better adapt to these changes. This includes improved analytics and strategies to maintain customer loyalty in response to changing consumer preferences.The Retail Industry: An AnalysisAccording to Deloitte, retail sales growth is expected to be limited by a slowing economy. In a baseline scenario with a 55% chance of happening, GDP growth is predicted to decrease from 2% in 2022 to 0.9% in 2023. Although a strong labor market will continue to drive sales, there is a risk of a recession which could lead to economic contraction and higher unemployment.Physical retail stores and online platforms are becoming important sources of advertising for vendors. Retailers are earning more revenue by selling marketing space to vendors, which strengthens their partnerships. The sale of advertising space on websites, in-store displays, mobile apps, and streaming services is expected to increase among retailers, with the greatest growth coming from streaming TV.The top retailers in the US are at the forefront of maximizing retail media networks. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was quick to use its acquisition of Thursday Night Football streaming to sell advertising space to vendors and enhance its marketing. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)’s partnership with Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU) to sell commercials on the ad-supported CTV will become even stronger if its potential merger with Albertsons goes ahead. Similarly, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has a long history of working with vendors on retail media networks and has created its own network called Walmart Connect, which generated over $2 billion in revenue in 2021. The growth of advertising revenue, excluding website placements, is expected to increase 38% in 2023, reaching $6.5 billion. The growth of social commerce offers a new opportunity for retailers and brands. Story continuesIn addition to exploring the most valuable retail companies in the world, investors can also check out 15 Internet Retail Stocks To Buy, 10 Best Retail Stocks To Buy Now, and Largest Retailers in the US. Our Methodology We used stock screeners to identify the most valuable retail companies in the world based on market capitalization as of January 31, 2023.

(NYSE:TJX). TJX is a leading off-price apparel and home goods retailer. After a couple of years of bumpy performance due to closing stores during the height of the pandemic and absorbing rising supply chain costs, sales and margins have reverted towards more normal levels.

(NASDAQ:JD) is one of the most valuable retail companies worldwide. Here is what Argosy Investors has to say about JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We sold JD as a result of the furor over Chinese stocks during the quarter. We had been concerned about China’s lack of respect for investor rights for some time, and Beijing has become significantly more aggressive in asserting itself of late. In addition, the legal structure Chinese companies use to come public in the U.S., a Cayman Islands shell corporation leaves American investors with an unsure path to recovering value should these companies cease to trade on U.S. exchanges. Because of the uncertainty, we exited our position in JD completely. We still love JD’s long-term prospects, but we cannot estimate the legal/regulatory risk associated with these companies anymore. More broadly, we are freeing up cash for some other positions we already own which have declined in this market, and after additional review, remain attractive.”9.

The company's Retail/LTC segment sells prescription and over-the-counter drugs, consumer health and beauty products, and personal care products. The company was priorly known as CVS Caremark Corporation and changed its name to CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in September 2014. Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”8.

(NYSE:NKE) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Adobe and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) were solid performers in the quarter as some of the doom and gloom narratives around these companies have waned as they both saw strong recent business results. Nike has been dealing with weak demand in China (mostly due to rolling COVID lockdowns) but also a bloated inventory position in North American apparel as well. Supply chain issues caused delays in last year’s inventory shipments. As those were overcome, newer orders came in earlier than expected causing the spike in inventory. On its most recent earnings call, it became clear to us that this inventory spike is a temporary supply issue and narrowly focused in apparel. Demand for Nike products is strong, especially for footwear where nearly every geography grew over 30% in constant currencies in the past quarter. The company expects the inventory issue to be largely behind it in the next two to three quarters and is already seeing inventory levels decline sequentially.”6.

The other will be about half price but may not be widely used as it is unlikely to appeal to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs)that recommend which drugs most insurance providers should cover.Most patients’ co-insurance costs are set as a percentage of list price and are expected to be calculated off the higher price.At least another seven Humira biosimilars are expected this summer and could debut with discounted list prices. Even then, patient groups, pharmacists, doctors and academics said they will be obscured by the U.S. private insurance system of middlemen negotiation and after-market discounts called rebates.PBMs say that the deep discounts they receive are returned to insurers and employers to lower their overall medical costs.Benjamin Rome, a drug pricing researcher at Harvard Medical School, said introduction of biosimilars in the United States has not sent prices tumbling as originally expected.Unlike pills, which have extremely cheap generic copies, complex, expensive biologic drugs made from living cells cannot be exactly duplicated. Their closest alternatives are called biosimilars.""The bottom line is it’s feasible that even if prices for Humira and biosimilars go down, this could be in the form of higher rebates to PBMs rather than actual lower prices that are passed onto patients,"" Rome said.The U.S. pays the highest drug prices in the world, in part because many different private sector companies do not have the power of a single government payer.Story continuesThe Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act will allow the government’s Medicare program for people aged 65 and older to negotiate prices of its most costly medicines, but drugs like Humira with direct competition are excluded.Humira - the world's biggest selling non-COVID prescription drug - is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and psoriasis.A 5% lower list price would result in a savings of about $35 a month for a person whose coinsurance payment is 10% of the list price.Some patients who qualify for AbbVie’s patient assistance programs pay heavily discounted rates. Amgen has launched a similar savings program for its version.There are currently about half a dozen drugs with biosimilar competition in the United States. Prices of those have decreased up to 20%, according to a report from the National Bureau of Economic Research.Amgen has set list prices of $1,557 and $3,288 per 40 milligram pen device, a two-week supply. Amgen executive Murdo Gordon told Reuters the lower price would attract healthcare systems that act as both an insurer and a provider and typically do not seek after-market discounts.""If you think of a pharmaceutical benefit manager, they would prefer the high list price, because their business model is extracting rebates from manufacturers and passing them on to their employer, customers or their downstream health plan customers,"" Gordon said.UnitedHealth Group’s OptumRX and Cigna Corp said last year they had deals to make Humira, as well as rivals from Amgen and others, available under the same pricing and access terms. CVS Health, another large PBM, plans to include the drug on its coverage list but as non-preferred with less favorable terms.JC Scott, president of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, said PBMs want more competition in the prescription drug marketplace and discouraged delays sought by drugmakers.""The bottom line is that increased competition is the most effective and sustainable way to drive prescription drug costs down,"" he said.LIST PRICES TO FALLIn Europe, where governments negotiate drug prices, AbbVie offered up to 80% discounts in November 2018, a month after Humira went off patent, Reuters reported.Additional AbbVie patents continued to protect it in the United States, and the company struck deals with Amgen and others to allow rival drugs in exchange for royalty payments.AbbVie declined to comment.Douglas Hoey, chief executive of the National Community Pharmacists Association, said he expected U.S. prices for drugs of this type to fall about 15%-20% after new competition enters in July.But Robert Popovian, the chief science policy officer at patient advocacy group Global Healthy Living Foundation, said it would take further market and public pressure after the summer entries to get list prices down.Analysts expect the introduction of biosimilar competition will drive down Humira sales. They are forecasting sales of $21.2 billion in 2022, dropping to $13.4 billion this year and $8.3 billion in 2024, according to Refinitiv. Analysts expect Amgen’s biosimilar to garner sales of $747.6 million in 2023 and $933.8 million in 2024.Marcus Snow, a rheumatologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said he would prescribe adalimumab, the chemical name for Humira, based on price and each patient’s insurance coverage terms.All things being equal, he said, he would keep existing patients on Humira and try to put new patients on the medicine that was most likely to be given preference on formularies in the future, to avoid switching.""I wouldn't expect to see the price changes that we all hope to have in the first year,"" Snow said.(Reporting by Patrick Wingrove in New York; Editing by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot)]"

R&amp;D expenses declined 2% year over year to $1.29 billion due to higher business development activity in the year-ago quarter, partially offset by higher spending behind pipeline candidates.2022 ResultsFull-year 2022 sales rose 1% to $26.32 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.23 billion. Sales were within the guided range of $26.0 billion to $26.3 billionAdjusted earnings for 2022 were $17.69 per share, up 27% year over year. Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.62 per share and were within the guided range of $17.25 to $17.85 per share.2023 GuidanceAmgen gave its financial guidance for 2023 that excluded any contribution from the pending acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics HZNP.In December, Amgen announced a definitive agreement to acquire Horizon Therapeutics for $116.5 per share in cash or $27.8 billion. The acquisition will add several first-in-class early-in-lifecycle biologic drugs like Tepezza, Krystexxa and Uplizna to Amgen’s broad and diversified portfolio. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of this year. AMGN will provide updated guidance for 2023 after the transaction closes.Revenues are expected in the range of 26.0 billion to $27.2 billion, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.46 billion.Earnings are expected in the range of $17.40 to $18.60 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $18.43 per share.Amgen expects Other revenues to be between $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion.Adjusted cost of sales as a percent of product sales is expected to be 16% to 17% in 2023.Adjusted R&amp;D costs are expected to increase 3% to 4% year over year from the 2022 level. S&amp;A spending is expected to decrease slightly year over year. Total operating expenses are expected to be flat versus the 2022 level.  Amgen expects the operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50% in 2023.The adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the range of 18.0%-19.0%, while capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $925 million. The company expects to buy back shares worth not more than $500 million in 2023.Our TakeAmgen’s fourth-quarter results were strong as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales. Its 2023 sales guidance fell short of market expectations, which explains the slight decline in the stock price in after-hours trading.Amgen witnessed double-digit volume growth for a number of its key products like Repatha, Prolia and Evenity in the fourth quarter and in the full year, with the trend expected to continue in 2023. However, pricing pressure and increased competition continued to hurt sales of some drugs as well as biosimilar products.In 2023, Amgen expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to be offset by lower revenues from Nplate, oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel and the absence of COVID-19 antibody revenues. It expects a mid-single-digit price decline in 2023Amgen currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It was also much lower than the 235,000 rise in the previous month.The survey is seen as a precursor to the Labor Department's more comprehensive reading on nonfarm payrolls for January on Friday.""What you're seeing here is an abrupt drop off in hiring, which implies the Fed is succeeding at what they set out to do - create increased unemployment and reduce demand, which will effectively lower inflation,"" Hayes said.Story continuesOn Tuesday, Wall Street indexes reversed declines and rallied when the Fed's preferred wages gauge, the U.S. Employment Cost index, showed its smallest increase in a year during the fourth quarter.Advanced Micro Devices Inc added 3.2% in premarket trading, bucking the recent nervousness among chipmakers.The company said it expects its business to improve in the second half of the year, boosting hopes that it is gaining on rival Intel Corp.Videogame publisher Electronic Arts Inc slumped 9% on lowering its annual bookings forecast, as the busiest week of the current earnings season enters the mid-way mark.Snap Inc tumbled 12.5% after the social media company said it expects current-quarter revenue to decline by as much as 10%. Other social media and internet firms like Meta Platforms Inc, Alphabet Inc and Pinterest were 0.3% to 1% lower.Facebook parent Meta is expected to report quarterly results after the bell.At 8:37 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 138 points, or 0.4%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis were down 9.75 points, or 0.24%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 8.25 points, or 0.07%.Dow Jones Industrial Average component Amgen Inc dipped 0.6% as the drugmaker said its fourth-quarter revenue fell slightly.Fourth-quarter earnings of S&amp;P 500 firms are expected to decline 2.4%, as per Refinitiv estimates.(Reporting by Johann M Cherian and Shreyashi Sanyal in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Ankika Biswas; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)]"

While growth in 2021 also reflected the rebound from the deeper recession during the Covid-19 pandemic, last year’s growth is remarkable, given Italy’s significant exposure to the energy and cost-of-living crises, with average inflation exceeding 8%, and limited spending for Next Generation EU (NGEU) investments.Last year’s growth of 3.9%, including the -0.1% contraction in Q4, was better than Scope Ratings expected (3.7% for the year and -0.5% for Q4). While the economy has slowed, this mild contraction points to greater-than-expected resilience to the energy and inflation shocks, which is mirrored across the euro area, which grew by 0.1% in the fourth quarter.For 2023, we expect the Italian economy to avoid a recession and grow by at least 0.5%. The deceleration is due to the adverse impact of tight financing conditions, with an expected ECB deposit rate of at least 3.0% by the second half of this year and persistent inflationary pressures both curbing consumption and investment.Still, the government’s fiscal support for vulnerable households and the successful diversification of natural gas supplies away from Russia, which now constitute only 10% of Italian gas compared with 43% before Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine, should support the Italian economy’s resilience. In addition, we expect actual spending of NGEU funds to kick in this year, supporting investments, although implementation of EU disbursements into actual spending on the economy has been delayed vis-à-vis initial plans so far.Figure 1 – Italy and euro area GDP growth, QoQ %, SA, WDASource: Eurostat, Macrobond, Scope RatingsRobust Economic Performance Supports Italy’s Public FinancesFiscal revenues grew more than 10% in the first 11 months of 2022 compared with the same period of the previous year. Revenues were driven by higher income from indirect taxes, benefiting from elevated inflation, and by the phasing out of tax breaks enacted during the pandemic. Together with contained spending, this has supported the reduction in the fiscal deficit, which will likely have narrowed to 5.2% of GDP last year from 7.2% in 2021.Story continuesFor 2023, we expect the new government’s fiscal stance to remain relatively cautious in light of rising policy rates and thus to maintain an overall prudent fiscal policy. The 2023 Budget Bill balances the need to consolidate public finances with providing temporary relief from higher energy costs of around EUR 21bn (1.1% of GDP) in 2023.The fiscal deficit will narrow only modestly to 4.8% of GDP this year. The primary balance should, however, gradually improve and turn into a 1% of GDP surplus by 2026. A higher interest burden, set to exceed 4% of GDP over the coming years, should keep the headline deficit close to or above 3% of GDP in the medium term.Italy’s debt-to-GDP ratio is set to decline only modestly to around 142% by 2027, and thus remain around 10pp above its pre-Covid level, significantly above that of Portugal (forecast debt-to-GDP of 97% by 2027) and Spain (107%).Even with an expected primary surplus of 1% of GDP, which compares with an average primary surplus of 0.9% over the past 10 years excluding the Covid shock in 2020, it is hard to see how Italy’s public finances can be significantly consolidated further, not least due to rising fiscal pressures from the country’s ageing population.For this reason, in the absence of higher growth, Italy will remain the second-highest indebted country in the euro area after Greece. Italy could even become the most indebted country in Europe by the end of the decade if Greece sustains current growth and primary surpluses beyond 2027.Figure 2 – Public debt-to-GDP trajectories %Source: Eurostat, Macrobond, Scope RatingsItaly’s 2023 budget, while ensuring gradual fiscal consolidation, mostly includes one-off measures limited to a single fiscal year rather than structural measures aimed at improving Italy’s economic and fiscal outcomes over multiple years. The forthcoming revision and re-implementation of the EU’s fiscal framework will likely maintain the 3% fiscal deficit rule, anchoring expectations for Italy’s medium-term fiscal trajectory.Still, the swift implementation of growth-friendly NGEU-related reforms and the associated investment plan are critical to addressing Italy’s persistent structural problems, including stagnant productivity, low labour-force participation and employment rates, especially among women and the young, and rising pressures on pension and healthcare expenditure due to its ageing population.These reforms and investments are critical to raising Italy’s growth potential to 1.25-1.50% from around 1%. This is needed to achieve steady debt reduction over this decade, which is a key driver to support Italy’s BBB+/Stable credit ratings from Scope.For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.Alvise Lennkh-Yunus is the Deputy Head of Sovereign and Public Sector ratings at Scope Ratings GmbH.

As the price spread between Australian and European coal is wide, Japanese companies plan to increase imports from South Africa, a Tokyo-based coal trader said.""We are looking into diversifying supply sources in areas (outside of Australia) such as Africa and South America,"" Kazuhiro Ikebe, president of Kyushu Electric, said last month.JERA, Japan's biggest power generator, has modified some equipment at its coal power plants so that it can burn a wider variety of coal, which has already helped bring down the fuel cost by about 26 billion yen ($202 million) in the nine months ended Dec. 31, Tetsuo Yoshida, the head of finance, said.Hokuriku Electric Power, which like other Japanese utilities posted a record net loss in the nine month period ended Dec. 31 because of soaring import costs, will continue to seek high-grade coal ""as much as possible,"" a company official said.""But (we) will also use medium-grade coal in which the cost reduction benefit outweighs higher consumption volume and ash handling costs,"" the official added.REPLACING RUSSIACoal imports from Russia have been in sharp decline since mid-2022 and preliminary broker data suggests they have fallen close to zero for February, according to Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group.To replace Russian coal, Japan has increased coal imports from several sources, including Indonesia, Australia, South Africa and even occasional cargoes from the Americas, including Canada, Colombia, and the United States, he said.Japan's biggest coal-fired power generator, Electric Power Development Co Ltd, is considering buying coal from South Africa to diversify procurement sources, a spokesperson said.($1 = 128.4800 yen)(Reporting by Yuka Obayashi; Additional reporting by Katya Golubkova in Riga; Editing by Florence Tan and Jamie Freed)]"

West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) settled at $75.88 a barrel, down 53 cents, or 0.7%.While new orders for U.S. manufactured goods rose broadly in December, orders for industrial equipment and other machinery fell, according to the latest Commerce Department data.""It was highlighting more slowing in the economy, particularly on the industrial side, which is a negative for petroleum,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital.A rebound in the dollar index, which hit a nine-month low earlier in the session on softer U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike bets, also weighed on oil prices, according to Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates. A stronger greenback makes dollar-priced oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.The Fed raised its target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, but continued to promise ""ongoing increases"" in borrowing costs as part of its battle against inflation.""Inflation has eased somewhat but remains elevated,"" the U.S. central bank said in a statement that marked an explicit acknowledgement of the progress made in lowering the pace of price increases from the 40-year highs hit last year.While inflation appears to have slowed in major economies, the response of central banks and the speed of reopening from COVID-19 lockdowns is uncertain.""Investors have become less confident in the strength of the outlook; something we could see change repeatedly in this first quarter due to the lack of visibility on interest rates and China's COVID transition,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.Helping to keep oil from moving lower was a European Union ban on Russian refined products set to take effect on Feb. 5, potentially dealing a blow to global supply.Story continuesEU countries will seek a deal on Friday on a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products after postponing a decision on Wednesday because of divisions among member states, diplomats said.The European Commission proposed last week that from Feb. 5 the EU apply a price cap of $100 a barrel on premium Russian oil products such as diesel and a $45 per barrel cap on discounted products such as fuel oil.Meanwhile, an OPEC+ panel endorsed the producer group's current output policy at a meeting on Wednesday, leaving production cuts agreed last year unchanged amid hopes of higher Chinese demand and uncertain prospects for Russian supply.(Additional reporting by Noah Browning in London;Editing by Marguerita Choy, Will Dunham, Kirsten Donovan and David Gregorio)]"

In early December they announced the purchase of Vivint Smart Home, a smart home platform company, for $2.8 billion. The transaction diversifies NRG’s business, increases leverage, dramatically reduces intermediate-term shareholder capital returns, and most importantly, is the opposite of what management told us they were going to do when they assumed the role in 2017. The stock fell 15% on the day of the announcement and is down another 5% since then, and now 10% lower than when we first wrote about it.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation in FocusHeadquartered in New York, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 11.09% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.37 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.93%. In comparison, the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield is 3.1%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.59%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.48 is up 4.2% from last year. Over the last 5 years, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.78%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's current payout ratio is 33%, meaning it paid out 33% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for BK for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.71 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 2.61%.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that BK is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The question is: Who will blink first?SOUTHFIELD, Mich., Feb. 2, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- After nearly two years of inflated new- and used-car prices – with car dealers asking consumers to pay thousands of dollars over MSRP – the US industry is primed for a reset to previous competitive norms.A combination of industry factors and macroeconomic conditions could trigger a potentially bloody battle for market share this year, according to an analysis by S&amp;P Global Mobility. Automakers and dealers that have grown accustomed to huge profits on vehicles sold as soon as they leave the factory will see a return to traditional conditions of accumulating showroom inventories and the need for incentives to move the metal.This could mean a big win for consumers still in the market for a new or used vehicle, and who are not intimidated by sharply increased lending rates or other economic headwinds. Already there are signs of increased new-car inventories and declining used-car prices – though not yet to pre-COVID levels.""Things will heat up this year when the first tranche of COVID-sold vehicles starts returning to market,"" predicts Dave Mondragon, vice president of product development for S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""These vehicles are all underwater. They were sold at record-high prices with no discounts, and there will be little to no equity to roll into a new vehicle.""It's not so much the volume of vehicles coming back – new-vehicle sales cratered in 2020 when production lines slowed due to supply chain snarls. But the practice by many dealerships of using vehicle shortages to sell at inflated prices means nearly every vehicle coming back has massive negative equity – with the customer owing thousands of dollars more than the vehicle is worth at trade-in. ""That's when discounting starts up again,"" Mondragon says.Story continuesInventory ReboundingWith supply chain snarls easing, an S&amp;P Global Mobility analysis of inventory data shows a 91% increase in advertised new-vehicle dealer stock at the end of December 2022 compared to February, a sharp 43% uptick compared to August 2022, and a 21% jump compared to October.""Though we're not back to historical norms, inventory pressures are starting to ease,"" said Matt Trommer, S&amp;P Global Mobility associate director of innovation product management for in-market reporting.""The only real difference was domestic and European brands seeing improved inventories earlier in 2022, and Asian brands ramping up to a greater extent in the second half of '22 after actually going down in the February-to-August period,"" Trommer said. ""In a few cases, we're seeing inventories coming up quite a bit. Jeep, GMC and Mazda are now showing a broad availability of vehicles. Other brands such as Honda, Kia and Subaru, however, are showing more limited availability.""S&amp;P Global Mobility Inventory-to-Sales Index""We're in the formative stages of inventory rebuilding following six months of year-over-year increases that ended 35 months of year-over-declines in July 2022,"" said Joe Langley, associate director of research and analysis for S&amp;P Global Mobility's North American Light Vehicle Forecasting &amp; Analysis team. ""Stellantis is the closest to having normalized inventory. They are going to have to ask themselves, 'What do we do next?'""In December, Ford, Chevrolet, Ram, and Jeep had about 300,000 units of leftover 2022 models advertised as available for sale. Those four brands accounted for 71% of 2022 advertised inventory listed by mainstream brand dealers - and 66% of all dealer-advertised inventory when including luxury marques. Among luxury brands, Mercedes-Benz and Lincoln still showed the most remaining 2022 vehicles in dealer advertised inventory, according to the S&amp;P Global Mobility analysis.That said, not every brand will be in the same circumstances. After the initial semiconductor crunch, GM, Ford, and Stellantis better managed their supply chains and are closer to being back to traditional production levels; the Japanese brands are still struggling with supply-chain issues. While less impacted, Hyundai and Kia are also dealing with structural issues of not having enough factory capacity to meet growing demand.""We're seeing the US3 being the closest to normalized inventory and they will have to start asking themselves hard questions relating to production planning, product mix and pricing along with incentives activity,"" Langley said. ""The surprise of 2023 will be vehicle availability. It will still be well below industry norms, but inventory for the spring selling season will be up 50-70% from 2022 levels.""Another element that could factor into increased consumer power in the new-car arena: A softening in inflated used-car values.When COVID shut down new-car manufacturing, demand (and prices) for used cars soared starting in early 2021. Data from CARFAX, part of S&amp;P Global Mobility, shows that – pre-COVID – average weekly dealer listing prices for used cars had held steady, slightly above $19,000. The first quarter of 2021 saw a rapid price shock that resulted in peak pricing of $29,025 in Q1 2022. But last fall, used-car prices started retreating. By mid-December, CARFAX data showed a retreat to $27,239. And while prices are nowhere near pre-COVID levels, there is no evidence that inflated prices will hold.One potential easing of a price crash: A momentary drop-off in off-lease cars coming back during the three-year anniversary of the COVID shutdown, when sales cratered for several months in 2020. A shortfall in the certified-pre-owned segment might resume demand pressure on the new-car side and temporarily hold prices steady.External ForcesThere are usually multiple causes of swings in market behavior, and it appears US light vehicle sales have a perfect storm of culminating events that will come to a head starting in spring 2023: In addition to rebounding vehicle inventories, a sharp rise in U.S. lending rates, inflation leading to lower disposable income among households, and nervy macroeconomic headwinds are worrying US consumers.Already there are storm clouds on the horizon in terms of demand destruction. The daily new-car selling rate metric remained remarkably steady in the second half of 2022, even while some pockets of inventory accumulated. While stubbornly sticky low levels of inventory dampened year-end clearance incentives, any backward movement in the daily selling metric to begin 2023 could be signal of a retrenching auto consumer.Households are eyeing the uncertain economy as a reason to hold back on new purchases. If workers do not receive 2023 pay raises commensurate with 2022's sudden inflationary spike, and large-scale layoffs continue, that will prompt conservatism in household capital expenditures.""Ongoing supply chain challenges and recessionary fears will result in a cautious build-back for the market,"" said Chris Hopson, manager of North American light vehicle sales forecasting for S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""US consumers are hunkering down, and recovery towards pre-pandemic vehicle demand levels feels like a hard sell. Inventory and incentive activity will be key barometers to gauge potential demand destruction.""From a forecasting perspective, S&amp;P Global Mobility recently downgraded the US demand settings for 2023 due to darkening economic clouds. The immediate release of pent-up demand of the past two years that many OEMs anticipated would absorb increasing production is now wavering, and may be eliminated altogether if consumers retrench their spending habits. This will prompt downward pressure on vehicle pricing.Who Blinks First? Where will the discounts first appear? Likely in full-size trucks. GM, Ford and Stellantis need full-size truck volumes and profits to support investment in their electrified futures. GM is the only one of the three that has incremental capacity to produce more full-size pickups – whether they're ICE or BEV. Ford is capacity-constrained until Blue Oval City comes online in the second half of 2025, and Stellantis has their own limitations in the short-term.""This essentially puts GM in the driver's seat if they want to increase incentives to drive additional volume. If they do this, Ford and Stellantis will be forced to follow,"" Langley said. ""There is still room for these manufacturers to increase incentives on their pickups and still be ahead on the revenue side if they experience comparable sales improvements from those higher incentives.""After all, pre-COVID incentives on big pickups were running $6,000 per unit in January 2020, and the Detroit automakers were still profitable. But recently, demand for pickups has waned as more buyers move to SUVs.Despite full-size pickups' important contributions to each brand's business case and factory output, the share of half-ton retail sales has been declining for more than two years, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility data. The segment's retail share in Q3 2022 was 7.8% – lower than in any other quarter dating back to Q3 2012.Another area of potential incentive skirmish? Likely in a high-volume segment with plenty of players, such as mainstream compact SUVs. In addition, a competitive luxury market with additional pressure from Tesla could see a higher-end brand with resurgent inventories use the opportunity to grab share. Meanwhile, Tesla's recent price cuts across its lineup could prompt a price war in the BEV space.At least one luxury automaker has stated it is openly looking at conquesting its rivals, and is already injecting money into the market to capture share. They see it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and are thinking that investing earlier in incentives – either cash on the hood, or subsidized lending rates – will result in the best chance to grab share. Meanwhile, another luxury brand with already strong days' supply is cranking up subsidized lease deals.The next automaker's sales chief willing to cede market share without a fight will be the first one. Performance bonuses, career trajectories, and factory output requirements hinge on it. Furthermore, failing to spend to retain market share has downstream costs: The cost of losing loyal customers, multiplied by the cost of thousands of conquests needed to replace them, must also be considered. Also, automakers' and suppliers' factories need to run at high percentages of capacity to be profitable. Lofty talk of inventory control sounds great, until just-built vehicles start stacking up in factory-overflow lots.Remember: Average transaction prices in December were $49,500, so for every 20,000 vehicles built, OEMs can generate nearly $1 billion in revenue – a tempting carrot for OEMs when revenue goals are under pressure.As a result, spring and summer of 2023 could force automakers into aggressively pursuing customers with incentives while attempting to maintain the healthy profit margins they have seen for the past two years.The upshot will be a chaotic accordion effect in monthly sales results, as fluctuating inventories run head-on into unsettled consumer confidence and numerous industry and macroeconomic conditions. Automakers and dealers will be hard pressed to find a consistently successful sales strategy that allows them to maintain or increase share during such uncertain times.About S&amp;P Global Mobility (www.spglobal.com/mobility)At S&amp;P Global Mobility, we provide invaluable insights derived from unmatched automotive data, enabling our customers to anticipate change and make decisions with conviction.

While growth in 2021 also reflected the rebound from the deeper recession during the Covid-19 pandemic, last year’s growth is remarkable, given Italy’s significant exposure to the energy and cost-of-living crises, with average inflation exceeding 8%, and limited spending for Next Generation EU (NGEU) investments.Last year’s growth of 3.9%, including the -0.1% contraction in Q4, was better than Scope Ratings expected (3.7% for the year and -0.5% for Q4). While the economy has slowed, this mild contraction points to greater-than-expected resilience to the energy and inflation shocks, which is mirrored across the euro area, which grew by 0.1% in the fourth quarter.For 2023, we expect the Italian economy to avoid a recession and grow by at least 0.5%. The deceleration is due to the adverse impact of tight financing conditions, with an expected ECB deposit rate of at least 3.0% by the second half of this year and persistent inflationary pressures both curbing consumption and investment.Still, the government’s fiscal support for vulnerable households and the successful diversification of natural gas supplies away from Russia, which now constitute only 10% of Italian gas compared with 43% before Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine, should support the Italian economy’s resilience. In addition, we expect actual spending of NGEU funds to kick in this year, supporting investments, although implementation of EU disbursements into actual spending on the economy has been delayed vis-à-vis initial plans so far.Figure 1 – Italy and euro area GDP growth, QoQ %, SA, WDASource: Eurostat, Macrobond, Scope RatingsRobust Economic Performance Supports Italy’s Public FinancesFiscal revenues grew more than 10% in the first 11 months of 2022 compared with the same period of the previous year. Revenues were driven by higher income from indirect taxes, benefiting from elevated inflation, and by the phasing out of tax breaks enacted during the pandemic. Together with contained spending, this has supported the reduction in the fiscal deficit, which will likely have narrowed to 5.2% of GDP last year from 7.2% in 2021.Story continuesFor 2023, we expect the new government’s fiscal stance to remain relatively cautious in light of rising policy rates and thus to maintain an overall prudent fiscal policy. The 2023 Budget Bill balances the need to consolidate public finances with providing temporary relief from higher energy costs of around EUR 21bn (1.1% of GDP) in 2023.The fiscal deficit will narrow only modestly to 4.8% of GDP this year. The primary balance should, however, gradually improve and turn into a 1% of GDP surplus by 2026. A higher interest burden, set to exceed 4% of GDP over the coming years, should keep the headline deficit close to or above 3% of GDP in the medium term.Italy’s debt-to-GDP ratio is set to decline only modestly to around 142% by 2027, and thus remain around 10pp above its pre-Covid level, significantly above that of Portugal (forecast debt-to-GDP of 97% by 2027) and Spain (107%).Even with an expected primary surplus of 1% of GDP, which compares with an average primary surplus of 0.9% over the past 10 years excluding the Covid shock in 2020, it is hard to see how Italy’s public finances can be significantly consolidated further, not least due to rising fiscal pressures from the country’s ageing population.For this reason, in the absence of higher growth, Italy will remain the second-highest indebted country in the euro area after Greece. Italy could even become the most indebted country in Europe by the end of the decade if Greece sustains current growth and primary surpluses beyond 2027.Figure 2 – Public debt-to-GDP trajectories %Source: Eurostat, Macrobond, Scope RatingsItaly’s 2023 budget, while ensuring gradual fiscal consolidation, mostly includes one-off measures limited to a single fiscal year rather than structural measures aimed at improving Italy’s economic and fiscal outcomes over multiple years. The forthcoming revision and re-implementation of the EU’s fiscal framework will likely maintain the 3% fiscal deficit rule, anchoring expectations for Italy’s medium-term fiscal trajectory.Still, the swift implementation of growth-friendly NGEU-related reforms and the associated investment plan are critical to addressing Italy’s persistent structural problems, including stagnant productivity, low labour-force participation and employment rates, especially among women and the young, and rising pressures on pension and healthcare expenditure due to its ageing population.These reforms and investments are critical to raising Italy’s growth potential to 1.25-1.50% from around 1%.

As the price spread between Australian and European coal is wide, Japanese companies plan to increase imports from South Africa, a Tokyo-based coal trader said.""We are looking into diversifying supply sources in areas (outside of Australia) such as Africa and South America,"" Kazuhiro Ikebe, president of Kyushu Electric, said last month.JERA, Japan's biggest power generator, has modified some equipment at its coal power plants so that it can burn a wider variety of coal, which has already helped bring down the fuel cost by about 26 billion yen ($202 million) in the nine months ended Dec. 31, Tetsuo Yoshida, the head of finance, said.Hokuriku Electric Power, which like other Japanese utilities posted a record net loss in the nine month period ended Dec. 31 because of soaring import costs, will continue to seek high-grade coal ""as much as possible,"" a company official said.""But (we) will also use medium-grade coal in which the cost reduction benefit outweighs higher consumption volume and ash handling costs,"" the official added.REPLACING RUSSIACoal imports from Russia have been in sharp decline since mid-2022 and preliminary broker data suggests they have fallen close to zero for February, according to Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group.To replace Russian coal, Japan has increased coal imports from several sources, including Indonesia, Australia, South Africa and even occasional cargoes from the Americas, including Canada, Colombia, and the United States, he said.Japan's biggest coal-fired power generator, Electric Power Development Co Ltd, is considering buying coal from South Africa to diversify procurement sources, a spokesperson said.($1 = 128.4800 yen)(Reporting by Yuka Obayashi; Additional reporting by Katya Golubkova in Riga; Editing by Florence Tan and Jamie Freed)]"

West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) settled at $75.88 a barrel, down 53 cents, or 0.7%.While new orders for U.S. manufactured goods rose broadly in December, orders for industrial equipment and other machinery fell, according to the latest Commerce Department data.""It was highlighting more slowing in the economy, particularly on the industrial side, which is a negative for petroleum,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital.A rebound in the dollar index, which hit a nine-month low earlier in the session on softer U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike bets, also weighed on oil prices, according to Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates. A stronger greenback makes dollar-priced oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.The Fed raised its target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, but continued to promise ""ongoing increases"" in borrowing costs as part of its battle against inflation.""Inflation has eased somewhat but remains elevated,"" the U.S. central bank said in a statement that marked an explicit acknowledgement of the progress made in lowering the pace of price increases from the 40-year highs hit last year.While inflation appears to have slowed in major economies, the response of central banks and the speed of reopening from COVID-19 lockdowns is uncertain.""Investors have become less confident in the strength of the outlook; something we could see change repeatedly in this first quarter due to the lack of visibility on interest rates and China's COVID transition,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.Helping to keep oil from moving lower was a European Union ban on Russian refined products set to take effect on Feb. 5, potentially dealing a blow to global supply.Story continuesEU countries will seek a deal on Friday on a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products after postponing a decision on Wednesday because of divisions among member states, diplomats said.The European Commission proposed last week that from Feb. 5 the EU apply a price cap of $100 a barrel on premium Russian oil products such as diesel and a $45 per barrel cap on discounted products such as fuel oil.Meanwhile, an OPEC+ panel endorsed the producer group's current output policy at a meeting on Wednesday, leaving production cuts agreed last year unchanged amid hopes of higher Chinese demand and uncertain prospects for Russian supply.(Additional reporting by Noah Browning in London;Editing by Marguerita Choy, Will Dunham, Kirsten Donovan and David Gregorio)]"

It was not clear from the report, which pulled information from data provider Crunchbase, what percentage of the funding came from the U.S. firms.Qualcomm Ventures and Intel Capital were involved in 13 and 11 investments in Chinese AI companies respectively, outpaced by GGV Capital which led U.S. firms with 43 total investments in the sector, the data showed.The Biden administration is expected to unveil an executive order this year curbing some U.S. investments in sensitive Chinese tech industries, as hawks in Washington blame American investors for transferring capital and valuable know-how to Chinese tech companies that could help advance Beijing's military capabilities.According to the report, U.S. investor GSR Ventures invested alongside China's IFlytek Co Ltd in a Chinese AI company after the speech recognition firm was added to a trade blacklist. Silicon Valley Bank and Wanxiang American Healthcare investments group made investments in Chinese AI firms alongside China's Sensetime before the powerhouse in facial recognition technology was added to the same trade blacklist.Both companies were added to the blacklist, which effectively bars them from receiving U.S. tech exports, in 2019 for alleged human rights violations related to the repression of Uighur Muslims.Some of the largest investments include Goldman Sachs' solo investment in 1KMXC, an AI-enabled robotics company, as well as an investment by three U.S.-based VC firms in Geek+, an autonomous mobile robot company, the report showed.Only one Chinese AI company that received funding from U.S. investors is involved in developing AI applications for military or public safety uses, according to CSET.

""We intend to focus on the premium segment in developed markets as well as some of the countries where we are seeing solid growth,"" he said.The smartphone maker showed off the S23 Ultra's performance at the Samsung Unpacked event in San Francisco with snippets of two films, ""Behold"" by Ridley Scott, director of ""Gladiator"" and ""The Martian,"" and ""Faith"" by South Korean director Na Hong-jin both filmed using the top-line Galaxy smartphone.It is Samsung's first-ever 200-megapixel camera sensor, and the series uses Qualcomm Inc's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile processor. Qualcomm said that with the S23 series, 100% of the processors used will be from Qualcomm.At the event, executives from Samsung, Qualcomm and Alphabet Inc's Google gathered on the stage to highlight their partnership in the XR space, which includes virtual and augmented reality.Anshel Sag, an analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy, said the three worked together in the XR space about a decade ago, but the reboot to partner this time comes as Apple Inc is expected to launch its mixed reality headset this year.""I think it's designed to give both Samsung and Google a little bit more credibility in the XR space, because they both have been pretty absent on the hardware side for quite some time,"" said Sag.Story continuesIn the United States, the base Galaxy S23 will be priced from $799 and two higher-specification versions, the S23 Plus and S23 Ultra, from $999 and $1,199, respectively. Samsung kept the prices at the same level as for last year's model despite rises in component costs.However, global smartphone shipments showed the largest-ever decline in a single quarter in the October-December period, when they were down 18.3% on a year earlier at 300.3 million units, according to data issued by research firm IDC last month. The figures cast doubt on forecasts for a modest recovery in the market for mobiles this year.In that tough environment, analysts said Samsung's mobile strategy would center on profitability through premium offerings, including the S series and foldables.""Samsung can't afford to focus on expanding volume anymore,"" said Liz Lee, associate director at research firm Counterpoint.""It must boldly simplify low- and mid-range products, the parts of the market where Chinese competitors have caught up a lot.""Samsung said on Tuesday that a decline in low- and mid-range smartphone sales in the fourth quarter had been greater than expected.

207,a1a7e827-ebac-47b0-b29f-cd9e130078bb,QCOM,2023-02-02,Samsung debuts S23 line complete with big camera improvements,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-debuts-s23-line-complete-with-big-camera-improvements-180000361.html,1675274400,STORY,"['005930.KS', 'GOOG', 'GOOGL', 'QCOM', 'AAPL']","[Samsung's new Galaxy S23 line up includes a 200-megapixel camera sensor. (Image: Samsung)Samsung on Wednesday debuted the latest generation of its flagship smartphone line: the Android-powered Galaxy S23. As in prior years, Samsung is offering three versions of the handset, the Galaxy S23, the Galaxy S23+, and the Galaxy S23 Ultra. The S23 will set you back $799, while the S23+ costs $999. The S23 Ultra, meanwhile, costs $1,199.Overall, the phones look largely similar to the Galaxy S22 line, though this time around, Samsung has removed the blocky housing around their camera lenses. The S23 and S23+ feature flat 6.1-inch and 6.6-inch displays, respectively, while the S23 Ultra gets a new 6.8-inch curved display with a larger flat surface area than the S22 Ultra.I’m a fan of the S23 and S23+’s overall aesthetic, largely because I’m not interested in the curved look of the S23 Ultra. A 6.8-inch phone is also a bit too large for my liking. But that doesn’t mean that the Ultra doesn’t have plenty of features to draw consumers.Each version of the S23 gets a Dynamic AMOLED 2x display, for rich colors, but the S23 Ultra’s refresh rate can be dropped down to 1 frame per second to save power and pushed up to 120 frames per second for speedy responsiveness. The S23 and S23+’s displays can drop down to 48 frames per second and up to 120. The lower the frame rate, the more battery life a phone can save. The screens, Samsung says, also have the highest brightness of any phone it’s offered before.The S23 Ultra features a massive 6.8-inch display and S Pen stylus. (Image: Samsung)Samsung is making the camera the star of the show this time around, and the S23 Ultra gets all of the love. First up is the S23 Ultra’s new 200-megapixel (MP) camera sensor. That’s an upgrade from the 108-MP camera sensor on the S22 Ultra. Samsung says you use that 200-MP sensor to take photos that you could then print on large canvases that you can hang in your home. Of course, there’s nothing stopping you from doing that on your S22+ or even via Apple's (AAPL) iPhone if you want.“We have to focus on a few areas of innovation and technology to stay ahead,” Jude Buckley, EVP and co-lead of Samsung Electronics America’s mobile business, told Yahoo Finance. “And one of those is leading and owning the camera space, both in terms of video and camera.”Story continuesThe big to-do about the 200-MP sensor is the fact that Samsung uses pixel binning, which combines 16 pixels into 1 pixel lager pixel to take a 12.5-MP shot with improved overall lighting and details. That’s especially helpful when taking low-light photos, and should make for an impressive camera setup. You can also opt to combine 4 pixels into 1 for a larger image.The S Pen allows you to take notes and draw on or just navigate around your S23 Ultra. (Image: Samsung)The S23 and S23+ also use pixel binning technology, though they get 50-MP sensors that combine 2 pixels into 1 in their photos rather than 4 pixels into 1 like the S23 Ultra. Of course, you can always take photos using the full 200 megapixels on the S23 Ultra or 50 megapixels on the S23 and S23+ by firing up RAW mode.All three smartphones offer nightography capabilities for taking low-light photos, but the S23 Ultra features an advanced night video that lets you capture the star trails in the night sky thanks to its 300x Hyperlapse time lapse setting. It also offers improved optical image stabilization for videos, which means you’ll be able to capture action shots while on the move without your video bouncing around.The S23 Ultra also gets the better camera lens setup. The phone comes with a 10x optical zoom telephoto lens, a wide angle lens, and an ultra-wide angle lens. The S23 and S23+, meanwhile, get 3x optical zoom telephoto lenses in addition to their wide and ultra-wide angle options.As for performance, the S23 line runs on Qualcomm’s (QCOM) Snapdragon 8 Gen. 2 chip for improved performance. As for battery life, the S23 Ultra gets a massive 5,000 mAh battery, while the S23+ and S23 get 4,700 mAh and 3,900 mAh batteries, respectively. Samsung says that’s a 200 mAh boost for both the S23+ and S23 compared to last year’s models. Storage, the company says, starts at 128GB for the base S23 and 256GB for the S23+ and S23 Ultra, and tops out at 1TB on the Ultra.On the display side of things, Samsung has a new Advanced Vision Booster that it says will adjust color and contrast depending on the kind of ambient light for a better overall experience. There’s also an Enhanced Comfort option that is meant to make it easier to view the display over long periods of time.As for software, the S23 lineup runs on Samsung’s OneUI 5.1 riding over Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Android OS. The S23 Ultra also gets Samsung’s S Pen stylus. The feature allows you to take notes, draw, and generally navigate around the Ultra, making it a powerful productivity device. This is just the second S23 phone to come with the S Pen, after Samsung killed off its Galaxy Note line.The Ultra should be a major seller if past precedent holds up. The S22 Ultra made up some 40% of the line’s sales globally, Buckley explained. But with smartphone sales declining compared to during the pandemic, we’ll have to wait to see how much the macroeconomic situation impact’s Samsung’s overall sales moving forward.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Tech newsletterMore from DanAMD earnings: Poor PC sales expected to continue to hammer chip industryApple says using its own chips gives it a 'unique advantage' over PC industryBig Tech layoffs are a problem of the industry's own making: Morning BriefGot a tip?

March and April demand for international destinations is up double-digits compared to last year.Travelers can find plenty of affordable getaways to top destinations including Fort Lauderdale, New York City and Toronto, all of which currently offer both round-trip airfare and hotel stays under $350.SEATTLE, Feb. 1, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- According to the latest data from leading travel app Expedia®, travelers are already planning their spring getaways, eyeing everything from Caribbean beach escapes to Alaskan cruises. Flight searches for March and April travel are up 40%1 compared to the same time frame last year, with interest in international destinations like Punta Cana, Paris and Tokyo up double-digits compared to Spring Break 2022. While average ticket prices are higher than last year, price-conscious travelers will still find savings by avoiding the busiest travel dates, choosing less crowded destinations and taking advantage of package discounts.Without the Covid-19 testing requirement of Spring Break ’22, international beaches are back on the map.Spring Break Airfare Tips2Despite the rising cost of airfare, it is still possible to plan a spring getaway that doesn't break the bank. Heading to a city destination will be cheaper – and likely less crowded – than a trip to an international beach resort. Regardless of the destination, travelers can stretch their dollars by following these tips:Story continuesAvoid peak dates in order to save: According to booking data, traveling during the first week of March (before March 9) or after April 16 will allow travelers to take advantage of the lowest airfares of the season. The busiest travel days during the period are March 10–11, and the priciest are Saturdays, March 25 and April 1.Depart on a weekday: During the spring travel period, travelers can save an average of more than 20% on round-trip airfare when departing on a Tuesday instead of a Saturday, plus enjoy shorter lines at the airport.Take advantage of pre-summer shoulder season: After mid-April, average ticket prices are expected to stabilize before the summer travel season ramps up. For those with flexible schedules, late April to mid-May is a great time to head to Europe or enjoy a domestic city escape at a lower price.Find the sweet spot: In most cases, booking about a month before domestic flights helps travelers save money on airfare, but when in doubt it's wise to set up price alerts as soon as there's a destination in mind. The Price Tracking and Prediction feature on the Expedia app uses machine learning to predict the best time to book and notifies travelers when flight prices drop.*How to Save on Lodging and Car RentalLodging and car rental rates remain relatively flat2 compared to Spring Break 2022. Savvy travelers can use these tips to score more value:Book accommodations 30–45 days out: While around 64% of spring breakers tend to lock in hotels 90+ days in advance, the ones who wait tend to get better deals. Expedia lodging data shows that, historically, booking hotels closer to a month out yields savings of around $30 per night.2Snag package savings: Bundling flights, hotel and car rental together on the Expedia app saves travelers an average of around 10%, or $300, and makes trip-planning easier.**Compare pick-up spots: Expedia data shows rates near cities tend to be cheaper than the average while rates near national parks and ski destinations are among the priciest.2 Off-airport lots can also be cheaper than picking up at the airport due to lower operating costs, so it pays to shop around.Spring Break Destination GuideTravelers seek to broaden their horizons this year, causing international beach destinations like Puerto Vallarta (+25%) and Punta Cana (+30%), along with culture capitals like Rome (+20%), Paris (+50%) and Tokyo (+55%) to see major spikes in flight searches.1Spring breakers looking to stay closer to home but avoid busy beach destinations are flying to their favorite big North American cities including New York City (+5%) and Montreal (+40%) or unplugging in nature in places like Banff National Park (+40%) and Jackson Hole (+60%).1 Cruises are also picking up steam for spring break. Demand for spring cruises to Alaska, for example, is up nearly 25% compared to the same time frame last year while demand for European cruises gains momentum going into the summer.3Still need help figuring out where to go this spring? Expedia's experts rounded up ten places to visit, including exciting domestic hotspots with airfare (ATP) under $350 and international bucket-list destinations under $700. Hotel prices (ADR) at these destinations remain under $350 per night.2Fort LauderdaleTorontoLos AngelesNew York CityPortlandSan JuanPhuketCopenhagenLisbonReykjavikAbout ExpediaExpedia® is one of the world's leading full-service travel brands, with a mission of helping travelers get the most out of every trip they take by providing everything they need all in one place and, above all else, feel supported every step of the way.

209,d876eeeb-6844-3bb1-a6a5-e0c962a5b4d3,LMT,2023-02-02,Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-corporation-lmt-attracting-140002580.html,1675260002,STORY,['LMT'],"[Lockheed Martin (LMT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned -3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.3% change. The Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, to which Lockheed belongs, has lost 2.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Lockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.23 per share, indicating a change of -3.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.01 points to a change of -0.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.18 indicates a change of +4.3% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Lockheed is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for LMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate of $14.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.2%. The $65.8 billion and $67.73 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -0.3% and +2.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryLockheed reported revenues of $18.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.1%. EPS of $7.79 for the same period compares with $7.24 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.25 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.06%. The EPS surprise was +5.13%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Lockheed is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The deal has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. Valued at $481.6 million, the contract is expected to conclude by Jan 31, 2028.Significance of ProphetProphet is the 24-hour, all-weather, near-real-time, ground-based, tactical signal intelligence/electronic warfare capability that allows easy integration into a vehicle. It is equipped with Prophet Enhanced sensors and a Prophet Control, which enable actionable intelligence, situational understanding and force protection.Its remarkable features enable interoperability in the global signal intelligence enterprise. Prophet Enhanced delivers collected data to common databases for access by the intelligence community.Prophet Enhanced boasts beyond-line-of-sight capability, which is based on the present Project Manager Warfighter Information Network–Tactical (WIN-T) architecture. This capability allows an extended distance and performs distributed operations.As nations are enhancing their military capability, General Dynamics, the prime contractor of such a remarkably efficient and effective detector, is likely to continue to witness a strong order inflow. The latest contract win is a bright example of that. This is likely to boost the revenue generation prospects of the Mission Systems business unit.Growth ProspectsNations have increased their defense spending on military equipment and various arsenals to strengthen their defense capabilities. The surge in the demand for defense products was also driven by the tiff between Ukraine and Russia, which led many nations to amplify their defense inventory to deter any sudden assault.In such a scenario, military sensors for effective intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance signals for the early detection of any emerging threat have witnessed increased demand. This may continue to rise in the days ahead as the need to modernize and upgrade the defense structure to become more war-efficient may fuel the demand.Story continuesIn this context, per the report from Mordor Intelligence, the military sensor market is projected to witness a CAGR of 5% during the 2023-2028 period. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics as it enjoys an established position in the military sensor market.A few defense primes that can reap the benefits of the aforementioned market are Lockheed Martin LMT, Northrop Grumman NOC and BAE Systems BAESY.Northrop Grumman's capabilities in electronic warfare, full-spectrum cyber and electromagnetic maneuver warfare span all domains — land, sea, air, space, cyberspace and the electromagnetic spectrum. Its product portfolio includes the Joint Threat Emitter, Multifunction Sensors, Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program, etc.Northrop Grumman’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 3.5%. Shares of NOC have returned 20.8% value to investors in the past year.Lockheed Martin’s infrared sensor systems provide advanced precision targeting, navigation, threat detection and next-generation intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. Some of its product ranges include the LONGBOW FCR, AN/APY-9 Radar, F-35 Electro Optical Targeting System, etc.Lockheed Martin’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 6.9%. Shares of LMT have returned 19.6% value to investors in the past year.BAE Systems’ advanced sensor systems integrate and collate information rapidly to give commanders superior situational awareness and targeting solutions. It provides and supports major surface ship radar systems and state-of-the-art land-based radars. Its product range has the AN/DPX-7 Reduced Size Transponder, Cyber Resilience Platform Intrusion Detector, etc.The long-term earnings growth rate of BAESY is pegged at 13.2%. Shares of BAE Systems have rallied 34.3% in the past year.Price PerformanceShares of General Dynamics have risen 9.5% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 7.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The stocks were left for dead last year as mortgage rates jumped over 7%. Sales of existing, and new homes, plunged virtually overnight.Wall Street thought the homebuilders were doomed with higher mortgage rates. Many people believed that this could be a replay of 2008 with inventory soaring, foreclosures and short sales, and prices plunging. The last place you would want to be in 2008 2.0 is in the homebuilder stocks.Has Housing Already Bottomed? But rates have come down off 2022 highs and the 30-year fixed is around 6%. According to some of the national, publicly-traded, homebuilders demand has picked up again. Is it a boom time again? No. But orders aren’t as bad as last year.Even more importantly, homebuilder margins are remaining elevated as lumber prices have fallen and other material costs have come down even though the builders are giving out more incentives, cutting prices and doing mortgage rate buydowns.The “Hope” TradeThe homebuilder stocks have rallied over the last 3 months on the “hope” trade for the spring season but they remain cheap on a P/E basis.Should investors be diving back into the homebuilder stocks?3 Cheap Homebuilder Stocks1. PulteGroup, Inc. PHMPulteGroup is one of the largest homebuilders in the United States.

These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.Story continuesNow let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?Ryan Marshall: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We ended 2022 on a high note as we closed almost 8,900 homes and delivered all-time fourth quarter records with homebuilding revenues of $5.1 billion and earnings of $3.85 per share. These results, in turn, helped PulteGroup finish the year with over $1 billion in cash and a net debt-to-capital ratio below10%. Bob will detail the rest of our Q4 results in a few minutes. Driven by the company's exceptional fourth quarter performance, PulteGroup delivered another year of great financial results. For 2022, our home sale revenues increased 18% over the prior year to $15.8 billion, our reported pre-tax earnings increased by 37% to $3.4 billion and our reported earnings increased 48% to $11.01 per share.These results provided us the flexibility to invest $4.5 billion into the business, while returning over$1.2 billion to shareholders, dividends and share repurchases. Let me just pause right here and thank our entire organization for their efforts in delivering such a great operating and financial results under some challenging market conditions. We are truly fortunate to have such an outstanding team. In assessing our 2022 financial results, we fully appreciate that gains in volume, pricing, gross margin and earnings reflect the stronger demand environment that existed earlier in 2022. As we all know, the Federal Reserve decision to hike rate 7x in 2022 and its fight against inflation is successfully slowing the economy, including housing.For the full year, national new and existing home sales across the country fell 16% and 18%, respectively from 2021. Consistent with the trend of these national numbers, our 2022 net new orders were down roughly 27% from 2021. The softer demand we've experienced as a result of consumers priced out of the market by higher prices and higher mortgage rates, along with those individuals who have moved to the sidelines given market uncertainties and risks. Despite the higher rate environment dominating the national conversation, we saw buyer demand improve as the fourth quarter progressed and can confirm this strength continued through the month of January. We will have to see how things progress from here, but I think this improvement attests to the ongoing desire for homeownership that exists in this country.Net signups both in absolute number and absorption pace increased as we move through each month of the fourth quarter and through the month of January. While seasonal trends have been distorted over the past few years, monthly sales moving higher as the fourth quarter progressed is atypical. In short, we're encouraged by the recent improvement in our new home sales. Based on feedback from our sales offices, buyers have been responding to the decline in mortgage rates. Consistent with this idea, I would add that rate buydowns remain among the top incentives for our customers. Along with the decline in mortgage rates, actions we've taken to help improve overall affordability appear to be gaining traction. In alignment with our strategy to find price and turn our assets, we continue to implement programs that enable consumers to buy homes in today's higher rate environment.The cost of these programs which might include rate buydowns, lower lot premiums, or even price reductions can be seen in our higher Q4 incentives. In the fourth quarter, incentives increased to 4.3% of sales price. On a sequential basis, this is up from 2.2% on closings in the third quarter of 2022. Beyond just adjusting incentives in many of our active communities, we have already introduced smaller floor plans to help lower future prices and associated costs. The introduction of smaller floor plans is just part of a comprehensive effort to lower overall construction costs to help offset the pressure on sales price. The obvious question now is will this strengthening of demand continue? Like all of us on this call, I've heard strong arguments on both sides.But the honest answer is that no one really knows. Home Builders are optimist by nature. And I want to believe that the Fed can orchestrate a soft landing, but the risk of a recession is real. We're currently seeing buyers respond to lower rates, and better pricing. But what happens is fed actions weaken the employment picture is uncertain. With today's volatile market dynamics, one of our frequent conversations with investors is around how Pulte plans to operate its business over the near-term. Given the long timelines associated with land development and home construction, we need to set a plan, but be prepared to adjust as market dynamics require. At a high-level, I'd like to share how we plan to operate the business for the foreseeable future.At our core, we remain a build order builder, but our system operates best with a steady volume of production. As such, our plan for the -- our plan is for a consistent cadence of new starts. This would include starting spec homes on a pace consistent with spec sales. We've shared on prior calls that in the current environment, buyers are showing a preference for homes that have near-term delivery dates. As an example, in the fourth quarter, spec sales represented over 60% of our new orders. Our recent sales show that we are finding the market clearing price using our strategic pricing tools to set price and incentives. Within today's sales environment, we will be intelligent about the process as we optimize our production machine and turn through our land assets.As always, our primary focus will be to deliver strong relative returns on invested capital through the cycle. In planning for 2023, we have assumed our current cycle time of 6-plus months will remain the reality for the next several months. Combining our planned starts, with our 18,000 homes currently in production, we expect to have a production universe that will allow us to close approximately 25,000 homes in 2023. We have goals in place to reduce cycle time, and our procurement and construction teams are already realizing success in cutting production days, but a lot of work remains to be done. Buyer demand will ultimately determine what the coming year looks like, but this is our operating plan. We see this as a prudent, balanced approach that checks key strategic boxes, namely; we maintain a level of production in our communities, which is critical when negotiating with local trades and suppliers.We keep an appropriate level of specs in production while seeking to control finished inventory, and we continue to turn our assets, generate cash and position the business for the next leg of the housing cycle. Given today's market dynamics, at this time, we will be providing guidance for our first quarter, but not the full year. In sharing our operational approach for 2023, we have hopefully conveyed a thoughtful process and conceptualize the opportunity we see for our business. Let me now turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of our fourth quarter results.Bob O'Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. PulteGroup completed the year by delivering a strong fourth quarter results, the benefits of which can be seen throughout our financial statements. In my analysis of the company's operating and financial performance, I will review our reported numbers as well as our financials adjusted for the specific items Jim noted at the start of this call. PulteGroup's fourth quarter home sale revenues increased 20% over last year to $5.1 billion. Higher revenues for the period were driven by a 3% increase in closings to 8,848 homes in combination with a 17% increase in average sales price to $571,000. The increase in average sales price in the quarter was driven by double-digit gains in pricing across all buyer groups.House, Construction, HomebuildersPhoto by Vita Vilcina on UnsplashOur closings for the quarter came in above our Q4 guide as we benefited from higher spec sales that closed in the quarter and a faster-than-anticipated recovery in our Florida operations following the impact of Hurricane Ian. The mix of closings in the fourth quarter was 36% first-time buyers, 39% move-up buyers and 25% active adult. This compares with last year's closings, which were comprised of 33% first time, 42% move-up and 25% active adult. The increase in first-time closings is consistent with changes in our mix of communities and the greater availability of spec homes in our first-time buyer neighborhoods. Our spec strategy emphasizes production within our Centex brand as almost 60% of spec units are in communities targeting first-time buyers.In the quarter, we recorded net new orders of 3,964 homes, which is a decrease of 41% from the same period last year. The decline in orders for the period reflects the ongoing softness in buyer demand caused by the significant increase in interest rates realized in '22 in combination with higher cancellations experienced in the period. As a percentage of sign-ups, the cancellation rate in the fourth quarter was 32% compared with 11% last year. Cancellations as a percentage of backlog at the beginning of the quarter totaled 11% in the fourth quarter this year compared with 4% in the fourth quarter last year. I would note that in the 4 years prior to the pandemic, quarterly cancellations as a percentage of beginning period backlog averaged 10%, so Q4 cancellations in relation to backlog were in line with historic norms.In the fourth quarter, our average community count was 850, which is up 8% from an average of 785 last year. Community count growth reflects new community openings as well as the slower closeout of certain neighborhoods. Based on planned community openings and closings, we expect our average community count in the first quarter of '23 to be flat sequentially or approximately 850 communities. For the remainder of '23, we expect quarterly community count to be up 5% to 10% over the comparable prior year quarter. By buyer group, fourth quarter orders to first-time buyers decreased 28% to 1,574, while move-up demand was lower by 56% to 1,241 homes and active adult declined 36% to 1,149 homes. As has been widely discussed, housing demand remains under pressure as higher interest rates and years of price appreciation have stretched affordability for buyers.We ended the quarter with a backlog of 12,169 homes with a value of $7.7 billion. This compares to the prior year backlog of 18,003 homes with a value of $9.9 billion. As Ryan discussed, our objective is to keep turning -- keep inventory turning, which requires that we start an appropriate number of homes. In the fourth quarter, we started approximately 4,000 homes, which is down 50% from the fourth quarter of last year, and, on a sequential basis, down about 40% from the third quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with a total of 18,103 homes in production, of which 10% were finished. Of our total homes under construction, 43% were spec. This is slightly above our target of having specs comprised approximately 35% of our work in process, but given buyer preference for a quicker close, we are comfortable having a few more homes in production.Based on our production pipeline, we currently expect to deliver between 5,400 and 5,700 homes in the first quarter of the year. As Ryan indicated, for the full year, we will have the production potential to close approximately 25,000 homes. These production numbers assume a continuation of current construction cycle times. Given the price of homes in backlog, the mix of homes we expect to close and the anticipated level of spec closings in Q1, we expect the average sales price for Q1 closings to be between $565,000 to $575,000. At the midpoint, this would be an increase of 12% over the first quarter of '22. In the period, we reported gross margins of 28.8%, which remain near historic highs for the company. This represents an increase of 200 basis points over the comparable prior year period, although down sequentially from the 30.1% gross margin we delivered in the third quarter.Looking ahead, we expect to deliver another strong quarter with Q1 gross margins of 27%, which includes the benefit of lower lumber costs due to the fall in lumber prices in the back half of '22. Any savings from ongoing renegotiation of labor and material contracts will be realized in future quarters, and we will have to see how much of this work benefits our '23 versus our '24 closings. Our reported fourth quarter SG&amp;A expense of $351 million, or 6.9% of home sale revenues, includes a net pre-tax benefit of $65 million from adjustments to insurance-related reserves recorded in the period. Exclusive of this benefit, our adjusted SG&amp;A expense was $415 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues. In Q4 of last year, our reported SG&amp;A expense of $344 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues included a net pre-tax benefit of $23million from insurance-related reserve adjustments .Exclusive of that benefit, our adjusted SG&amp;A expense was $367 million or 8.7% of home sale revenues. With the pullback in overall housing demand, we've worked hard to ensure our overheads are properly aligned with today's tougher operating conditions. As such, we expect SG&amp;A expense in Q1 to be in the range of 10.5%to 11% compared with 10.7% last year. In other words, even with lower closing volumes, we are in a position to realize overhead leverage that is comparable to '22. Reported fourth quarter pre-tax income from our financial services operations was $24 million, down from $55million last year. The decline in pre-tax income reflects both lower profitability per loan and an overall decrease in loan origination volumes as mortgage capture rate declined by 10 percentage points to 75%.In the fourth quarter, we walked away from 21,000 option lots and an associated $900 million in future land acquisition spend. As a result of these actions, we incurred a pre-tax charge of $31 million for the write-off of related pre-acquisition costs and deposits. This charge was offset by a pretax gain of $49 million in JV income associated with the sale of commercial property completed in the quarter. Our reported tax expense for the fourth quarter was $282 million, which represents an effective tax rate of24.2%. Our Q4 taxes included a $12 million charge associated with deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments recorded in the period. We expect our tax rate in the first quarter and for the full year in '23 to be 25%. On the bottom line, our reported net income for the fourth quarter was $882 million or $3.85 per share.On an adjusted basis, the company's net income was $832 million or $3.63 per share. These results compared with prior year reported net income of $663 million or $2.61 per share, and adjusted net income of $637 million or$2.51 per share. Moving past the income statement, we invested $1.1 billion in land acquisition and development in the fourth quarter, with almost 65% of this spend for development of existing land assets. For the full year, we invested a total of $4.5 billion in land, including $1.9 billion of acquisition and $2.6 billion of development spend. Given recent decisions to exit certain option land positions, we ended the year with 211,000 lots under control, which is down 8% from last year and down 13% from the recent Q2 peak of 243,000 lots.With the decision to drop option lot deals over the past two quarters, owned lots currently represent 52% of lots under control. As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, given the slowdown in overall housing activity, we plan to dramatically lower our land spend in 2023. At this time, we expect our total land investment to be approximately$3.3 billion, with an estimated 65% of these dollars going toward development of owned land positions. Along with investing in the business, we continue to allocate capital back to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.4 million common shares at a cost of $100 million for an average price of $41.81 per share. PulteGroup continues to maintain one of the most active share repurchase programs in the industry, having repurchased 24.2 million shares of common stock in 2022, or almost 10% of our shares outstanding, for $1.1billion at an average cost of $44.48 per share.In 2022, we returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. After allocating capital to the business and our shareholders, we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and a net debt to capital ratio of 9.6%. On a gross basis, our debt to capital ratio was 18.7%, which is down from 21.3% last year. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.Ryan Marshall: Thanks, Bob. For all the financial success that we realized in 2022, I can tell you it was a hard year to navigate. When the year started out, we had almost unlimited demand, but supply chain disruptions resulted in countless bottlenecks and extended build cycles. As the year progressed and rising interest rates push more and more consumers to the sidelines, we initiated a series of operational changes as we quickly adapted to the more competitive market conditions. If there is a silver lining in today's challenging demand environment, I think we have what can be viewed as favorable supply -- as a favorable supply dynamic. Recent figures from the National Association of Relators show the inventory of existing homes for sale at 970,000, or only 2.9 months of supply.Existing homes are our industry's biggest source of competition, so such limited supply is certainly advantageous. As we sit here today, I'm incrementally more optimistic about the year ahead, but as the expression goes, hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. I think what we've done -- well, I think that we've done that in terms of how we've setup our business. We head into 2023 with enough units in production to meet demand and with production plans will allow us to continue turning assets. At the same time, we don't have an excess of spec homes in the system that will cause incremental self-inflicted pressures. We are in a strong competitive position within the markets that we serve. We are typically among the biggest builders in our markets, and our ability to serve all price points provides opportunities with land sellers and municipalities.And finally, we are in exceptional financial position with plenty of liquidity, no debt maturities for 3 years and expectations for another year of strong cash flow. There are opportunities to be seized upon even in challenging market conditions. When the time comes, PulteGroup will have the flexibility to take advantage of those opportunities. I will close by again thanking the entire PulteGroup organization for their work this past year to build outstanding homes and to provide an exceptional customer experience. Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer.Jim Zeumer: Thanks, Ryan. We are now prepared to open the call for questions so we can get through as many questions as possible during the time remaining. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Devin, if you will open it up for questions, we are all set.See also 12 Cheap Bank Stocks To Buy  and 15 Most Undervalued NASDAQ Stocks.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

The capital-intensive utility stocks were impacted by the ongoing increase in interest rates and rising operating costs, while new rates implemented in their service territories boosted profits.Factors to ConsiderDomestic-focused companies operating in the sector are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure is allowing the utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation.A clear transition is evident in the Utilities space, with the players gradually moving toward clean sources of fuel to produce electricity and lower emission. The stringent regulation of emissions, the high cost of conventional fuel and government incentives on the usage of clean fuel are also urging the utilities to focus more on clean energy sources. Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades.The passage of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will support and accelerate the utilities transition toward clean energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The Act entails opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions, in a much predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility.Utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, and are capital-intensive in nature. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels. The increase in borrowing costs in 2022 is likely to have pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted earnings.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

222,594869d8-d422-3b54-8773-32caf35521a8,JNJ,2023-02-02,Corporate lawsuit dodge imperiled after court rejects J&J bankruptcy tactic,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corporate-lawsuit-dodge-imperiled-court-110804592.html,1675336084,STORY,"['JNJ', 'MMM']","[By Dan Levine and Mike Spector(Reuters) - Attorney Greg Gordon, a partner at the Jones Day law firm, offered an innovative solution to Johnson &amp; Johnson and other major companies that faced mountains of lawsuits alleging their products sickened or killed people: They could use the bankruptcy system to force all plaintiffs into one settlement.It required fancy legal footwork — creating a subsidiary to shoulder all the liability, then putting that new company into Chapter 11.Plaintiffs’ lawyers attacked the gambit, known as the “Texas two-step,” charging it amounted to a bad-faith bankruptcy filing and a fraudulent ploy to shield the parent companies’ assets. Not so, Gordon told judges overseeing bankruptcies testing the novel strategy. The parent firms, he said, would give these subsidiaries plenty of money — billions of dollars — to compensate plaintiffs.It turns out that Gordon’s play to reassure bankruptcy judges created a new legal problem. The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday stopped the music on J&amp;J's two-step, ruling that its cash-flush subsidiary had no legitimate claim to bankruptcy protection because it wasn't in “financial distress.”The ruling forces J&amp;J back into trial courts to battle nearly 40,000 lawsuits and casts a cloud over the legality of the Texas two-step strategy. The plaintiffs allege J&amp;J’s talc products, including Baby Powder, caused cancer, which the company denies.The appeal court judges’ reasoning underscored what some legal experts call an inherent contradiction: bankruptcies being executed by multinational firms worth billions of dollars that were in little danger of running out of money to pay plaintiff-creditors. The panel dismissed the main argument underpinning Gordon’s and the companies’ primary defense of the strategy. The companies had contended the bankruptcies served the greater good of all parties, including plaintiffs, by delivering fair payouts more efficiently and equitably than the “lottery” offered by trial courts.Story continuesThe decision rejected “the idea that a profitable company can force personal-injury claimants out of jury trials, and into a bankruptcy court, merely by arguing that doing so is more efficient than the civil justice system,” said Melissa Jacoby, a professor at University of North Carolina School of Law with expertise in bankruptcy law.Gordon and Jones Day did not respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Johnson &amp; Johnson’s subsidiary said in a statement that the company would seek a rehearing of the panel’s decision by the full 3rd Circuit court. The attorney, Neal Katyal, said the potential cost of fighting the lawsuits justified the bankruptcy filing.Reuters last year detailed the secret planning of Texas two-steps by Johnson &amp; Johnson and other major firms in a series of reports exploring corporate attempts to evade lawsuits through bankruptcies.The judges’ reasoning on J&amp;J, as a precedent, heightens the legal hurdles for companies pursuing the novel strategy. The ruling could leave two-stepping firms caught between the conflicting demands of bankruptcy courts and the appeals courts that are likely to hear more challenges to the tactic.Bankruptcy judges, for their part, are loath to approve any move that blocks creditors from tapping debtor assets. Their courts crack down on firms that try, for instance, to shield money by moving it out of company accounts before filing for Chapter 11, known as a fraudulent transfer of assets. Plaintiffs opposing two-step bankruptcies have alleged the tactic amounts to a creative fraudulent transfer because it shields the firm being sued by shifting its liabilities to a new shell company.Gordon said at a bankruptcy attorneys’ conference last April that J&amp;J and three other firms attempting two-steps countered such concerns by agreeing to “unlimited” funding of their subsidiaries. The new units had ample cash to pay claims, the reasoning went, so fraud couldn’t possibly be the intent.“We don’t even want to have an argument” about fraudulent transfers, Gordon said.Gordon’s strategy worked in bankruptcy court but set up J&amp;J for failure when it faced the 3rd Circuit appeals panel. J&amp;J’s assertions that it generously financed its subsidiary, LTL Management, undercut any claim of financial peril, the judges ruled.“We take J&amp;J and LTL at their word and agree” that the subsidiary had plenty of money, wrote Circuit Judge Thomas Ambro, explaining why LTL did not qualify for bankruptcy. The judge noted that J&amp;J’s promise of unlimited funding was essentially an “ATM” for the subsidiary, insulating it from “any threat to its financial viability.”50 YEARS OF LITIGATION?Johnson &amp; Johnson now finds itself facing the same mountain of litigation that prompted its bankruptcy gambit.Gordon, at the bankruptcy conference, described the lawsuits as “completely unmanageable” and a dire threat to J&amp;J that could go on for decades. The company’s costs of verdicts, settlements and legal fees soared to about $4.5 billion in five years, he said.“How do you litigate 40,000 cases? How do you deal with the fact you’re getting 10,000 more per year, and they’re anticipated to continue for the next 50 years?” Gordon asked. “What do you do about that as a company, no matter how big you are?”Johnson &amp; Johnson, with a market capitalization of more than $400 billion, argues that the avalanche of lawsuits posed a serious financial threat. “The current situation, with a significant volume of current and future claims, and a plaintiff bar business model primed to generate more, is exactly the sort of ongoing and future financial distress that courts have recognized as serving a valid bankruptcy purpose,” Katyal, the lawyer for J&amp;J’s subsidiary, said in a statement to Reuters.J&amp;J faces a steep challenge in seeking to overturn the bankruptcy dismissal, two legal experts said. The full 3rd Circuit is unlikely to reverse Judge Ambro because he is an expert in bankruptcy law, said Jacoby, the University of North Carolina law professor. And the U.S. Supreme Court typically intervenes only when there are conflicting decisions among courts of appeal, said Lindsey Simon, a University of Georgia School of Law professor.The 3rd Circuit is the only appeals court that has weighed in so far, but other circuits could soon take up challenges to similar bankruptcy filings.'CREATIVE LAWYERS'In addition to J&amp;J, four other firms have pursued subsidiary bankruptcies aimed at halting dangerous-product lawsuits. Three of the firms executed Texas two-steps, with the help of Gordon and Jones Day: global construction giant Saint-Gobain and manufacturers Georgia-Pacific and Trane Technologies. (The strategy gets its name from the Texas law used to divide the company being sued into two, creating the subsidiary that absorbs liability.) 3M Co executed a similar bankruptcy maneuver to seek refuge from about 290,000 claims over allegedly defective military earplugs.Saint-Gobain, Trane Technologies and 3M declined to comment. Georgia-Pacific did not respond to inquiries.The 3rd Circuit ruling does not directly affect these cases, but other courts could soon weigh in. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to hear arguments in coming months on a challenge to the 3M subsidiary’s bankruptcy. Instead of creating a company, as in a Texas two-step, 3M assigned its lawsuits to an existing subsidiary. The goals were the same: To halt the lawsuits and force plaintiffs into a bankruptcy settlement.An Indiana bankruptcy judge last year, however, broke with typical practice by allowing the lawsuits to proceed against 3M even as its subsidiary’s Chapter 11 case continued, essentially defeating the point of 3M’s maneuver.If the 7th Circuit sides with 3M and issues an opinion contradicting the 3rd Circuit decision, it could raise the chances of a Supreme Court intervention. If 3M loses, it could strengthen case law against such bankruptcy gambits and further discourage companies from pursuing them.A challenge to the Georgia-Pacific Texas two-step, meanwhile, is proceeding in the 4th Circuit. After a North Carolina judge rejected a plaintiffs’ challenge alleging the bankruptcy was filed in bad faith, plaintiffs’ attorneys made a different argument — one echoing the 3M case. The litigation, they asserted, should be allowed to proceed against Georgia-Pacific because the parent company did not file for bankruptcy. That issue is now pending before the 4th Circuit appeals court.The 3rd Circuit panel noted it did not intend to outlaw the Texas two-step outright. Judge Ambro went out of his way to praise lawyers such as Gordon for “being inventive” and “experimenting with novel solutions.”Still, the legal guard rails in Ambro’s ruling will make it much more difficult for companies to execute Gordon’s playbook, said David Molton, a Brown Rudnick LLP lawyer representing talc plaintiffs who challenged the J&amp;J tactic.Ambro put “pretty firm gates” on bankruptcy tactics aimed at halting defective-product litigation, Molton said. “What Judge Ambro did say is: ‘I’m not here to do away with creative lawyers, but I’m here to tell you when that creative lawyering goes outside the bounds, I’m going to put a stop to it,” Molton said.(Reporting by Dan Levine and Mike Spector; editing by Brian Thevenot)]"
223,df4e769d-b169-383b-be3d-9380405c6172,JNJ,2023-02-02,INSIGHT-Corporate lawsuit dodge imperiled after court rejects J&J bankruptcy tactic,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insight-corporate-lawsuit-dodge-imperiled-110000961.html,1675335600,STORY,"['JNJ', 'MMM']","[By Dan Levine and Mike SpectorFeb 2 (Reuters) - Attorney Greg Gordon, a partner at the Jones Day law firm, offered an innovative solution to Johnson &amp; Johnson and other major companies that faced mountains of lawsuits alleging their products sickened or killed people: They could use the bankruptcy system to force all plaintiffs into one settlement.It required fancy legal footwork — creating a subsidiary to shoulder all the liability, then putting that new company into Chapter 11.Plaintiffs’ lawyers attacked the gambit, known as the “Texas two-step,” charging it amounted to a bad-faith bankruptcy filing and a fraudulent ploy to shield the parent companies’ assets. Not so, Gordon told judges overseeing bankruptcies testing the novel strategy. The parent firms, he said, would give these subsidiaries plenty of money — billions of dollars — to compensate plaintiffs.It turns out that Gordon’s play to reassure bankruptcy judges created a new legal problem. The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday stopped the music on J&amp;J's two-step, ruling that its cash-flush subsidiary had no legitimate claim to bankruptcy protection because it wasn't in “financial distress.”The ruling forces J&amp;J back into trial courts to battle nearly 40,000 lawsuits and casts a cloud over the legality of the Texas two-step strategy. The plaintiffs allege J&amp;J’s talc products, including Baby Powder, caused cancer, which the company denies.The appeal court judges’ reasoning underscored what some legal experts call an inherent contradiction: bankruptcies being executed by multinational firms worth billions of dollars that were in little danger of running out of money to pay plaintiff-creditors. The panel dismissed the main argument underpinning Gordon’s and the companies’ primary defense of the strategy. The companies had contended the bankruptcies served the greater good of all parties, including plaintiffs, by delivering fair payouts more efficiently and equitably than the “lottery” offered by trial courts.Story continuesThe decision rejected “the idea that a profitable company can force personal-injury claimants out of jury trials, and into a bankruptcy court, merely by arguing that doing so is more efficient than the civil justice system,” said Melissa Jacoby, a professor at University of North Carolina School of Law with expertise in bankruptcy law.Gordon and Jones Day did not respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Johnson &amp; Johnson’s subsidiary said in a statement that the company would seek a rehearing of the panel’s decision by the full 3rd Circuit court. The attorney, Neal Katyal, said the potential cost of fighting the lawsuits justified the bankruptcy filing.Reuters last year detailed the secret planning of Texas two-steps by Johnson &amp; Johnson and other major firms in a series of reports exploring corporate attempts to evade lawsuits through bankruptcies.The judges’ reasoning on J&amp;J, as a precedent, heightens the legal hurdles for companies pursuing the novel strategy. The ruling could leave two-stepping firms caught between the conflicting demands of bankruptcy courts and the appeals courts that are likely to hear more challenges to the tactic.Bankruptcy judges, for their part, are loath to approve any move that blocks creditors from tapping debtor assets. Their courts crack down on firms that try, for instance, to shield money by moving it out of company accounts before filing for Chapter 11, known as a fraudulent transfer of assets. Plaintiffs opposing two-step bankruptcies have alleged the tactic amounts to a creative fraudulent transfer because it shields the firm being sued by shifting its liabilities to a new shell company.Gordon said at a bankruptcy attorneys’ conference last April that J&amp;J and three other firms attempting two-steps countered such concerns by agreeing to “unlimited” funding of their subsidiaries. The new units had ample cash to pay claims, the reasoning went, so fraud couldn’t possibly be the intent.“We don’t even want to have an argument” about fraudulent transfers, Gordon said.Gordon’s strategy worked in bankruptcy court but set up J&amp;J for failure when it faced the 3rd Circuit appeals panel. J&amp;J’s assertions that it generously financed its subsidiary, LTL Management, undercut any claim of financial peril, the judges ruled.“We take J&amp;J and LTL at their word and agree” that the subsidiary had plenty of money, wrote Circuit Judge Thomas Ambro, explaining why LTL did not qualify for bankruptcy. The judge noted that J&amp;J’s promise of unlimited funding was essentially an “ATM” for the subsidiary, insulating it from “any threat to its financial viability.”50 YEARS OF LITIGATION?Johnson &amp; Johnson now finds itself facing the same mountain of litigation that prompted its bankruptcy gambit.Gordon, at the bankruptcy conference, described the lawsuits as “completely unmanageable” and a dire threat to J&amp;J that could go on for decades.

But it was actually his first role as a process engineer that laid the foundation for his current leadership.“I worked at a plant where the factory manager was legendary for his focus on cost management,” Mahendra-Rajah explains. “Despite that frugality, one day there was a large order for a discontinued product and I was tasked with restarting the plant, with no expense spared. It amazed me how we spent so much energy on cost management historically, and this mentality shifted completely with the right profit opportunity.” Dealing with supply and demand dynamics was key to his understanding of finance’s influence at an organization, and compelled him to pursue an MBA at Purdue University.Prior to joining ADI in 2017, Mahendra-Rajah was CFO of WABCO Holdings Inc., a global supplier of commercial vehicle technologies. He previously served as division CFO and in other financial leadership roles at Applied Materials, Visa, and United Technologies.“Early in my career, I had a mentor who taught me that to be an effective finance leader, you need to generate constructive conflict, but in an approachable and positive manner, to improve decision-making,” he says.What's a challenge you faced when entering your first-ever C-suite job? “You quickly realize that there is nobody to back-stop you. To put it another way, you can no longer walk into your boss’ office and ask if this sounds right or wrong because you would be walking into the CEO’s office. This is a significant shift in mindset, and what I learned was that you need to have confidence in yourself and trust that the experiences gained throughout your career have prepared you for the opportunity. While it can be intimidating at first, you have to trust your instincts and your team.”Story continuesWhat would you tell your younger self? ""I have always been a firm believer in the 70-20-10 talent development model, which says that 70% of employee development is driven by experience,"" Mahendra-Rajah says.He is referring to the 70-20-10 rule, a leadership development finding, that people tend to learn 70% of their knowledge from challenging experiences and assignments, 20% from developmental relationships, and 10% from coursework and training.""Early in your career, you must commit to learning the business fundamentals from the products to the customers, not just the financial statements,"" Mahendra-Rajah says. ""You also have the benefit of being new, so it’s easier to ask questions, build your business acumen and take the riskier role to gain different experiences. This serves you tremendously later in your finance career when you need to solve problems with pattern recognition.”W. Dave Dowrich, senior executive vice president and CFO at TIAA, a financial services organization“I am first-generation college-educated,” says W. Dave Dowrich. He originally thought he’d be an architect when entering the University of Toronto. But earning advanced credits from his high school in Barbados led him to a major in applied statistics and actuarial science, and eventually to the CFO chair.Dowrich, who joined TIAA in 2021, handles financial management and planning, actuarial, tax, accounting, and financial reporting. Before TIAA, he served as CFO of international businesses at Prudential Financial. He also had various leadership roles at American International Group (AIG) including interim CEO of international life and retirement, and several divisional CFO roles.Dowrich credits an internship at Manulife in Toronto as providing a solid learning experience. In addition, the rigor of preparing for the “intense” actuarial exam process created camaraderie amongst a group of 20 or 30 students he knew. “So that gave me comfort; it gave me support,” he says.“Not only was I enthralled by what I was doing during the day, coursework that included the combination of math and business, but my internship also provided me with a network that was really, really important,"" he explains.The actuarial community remained supportive, including at consulting jobs he had at firms such as Willis Towers Watson, while still working through the rest of his actuarial exams, Dowrich says. Senior partners became both informal and formal mentors. And that type of mentorship continued throughout his career.“Every job change that I’ve contemplated, I’ve had somebody in my corner to talk to, whether it be an uncle or the CEO of a firm I was working for at the time,” says Dorwich, who earned his MBA at The Wharton School.Dowrich is currently one of few Black CFOs at Fortune 500 and S&amp;P 500 companies, and reports to Thasunda Brown Duckett, the first woman to become CEO of TIAA, and one of two Black women who are currently chief executives of a Fortune 500 company. “Thasunda has always said that talent is created equally but opportunity is not,” he explains. “So we need to keep creating opportunities, not just in the C-suite but up and down organizations to keep this trend moving forward.”Karen Parkhill, EVP and CFO at Medtronic, a global producer of medical devices and therapies“Growing up in Springfield, Illinois, the daughter of a doctor and a nurse, I originally wanted a career in medicine,” Karen Parkhill explains. “It wasn’t until three semesters into my undergraduate studies at Southern Methodist University in Dallas that I really recognized my love of math, which ultimately led me to shift gears into pursuing a career in finance.""During summers at college, Parkhill first worked in the county clerk’s office filing and helping process misdemeanor tickets. She then later landed an internship in the installment loan department at a local bank. “It was there that I began to understand a little the world of finance—or at least lending,” Parkhill says.When exploring careers toward the end of college, she realized the most coveted and difficult job to land post-college was in investment banking. “I am one who continually seeks the next highest challenge,” says Parkhill who earned an MBA at the University of Chicago. She joined JP Morgan in 1992, rose to CFO for the commercial banking business, then moved to Comerica as vice chairman and CFO.“I don’t think I’d be where I am today in my career—or my personal life—without the mentorship I’ve received through the years,” she says. Parkhill currently serves as the executive sponsor for Medtronic’s Women's VP Network.What's a challenge you faced when entering your first-ever C-suite job? ""Early on in my career, I encountered male domination in investment banking. My career and personal life both started to flourish simultaneously and after marrying my husband, we made plans to start a family. Sadly, back at that time in investment banking, there were very few senior women role models, and almost an unspoken rule that you shouldn’t start a family before you were a vice president. I did follow this cue and fortunately, things turned out fine for me and we’ve been blessed with our beautiful family—but one of the things that I tell women now is, ‘Never, ever put your personal life on hold for your professional life.’”Tune in tomorrow for Part 4 of our series for aspiring CFOs.

Republic Services (RSG), which belongs to the Zacks Waste Removal Services industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This waste management company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11.30%.For the last reported quarter, Republic Services came out with earnings of $1.34 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21 per share, representing a surprise of 10.74%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.18 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.32 per share, delivering a surprise of 11.86%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Republic Services lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Republic Services has an Earnings ESP of +3.10% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 15, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Stocks backed by regular dividends can reduce the volatility of a portfolio and tend to outperform in a choppy market. In particular, focusing on the growth level in this strategy leads to higher returns. Honing in on stocks with a history of dividend growth leads to a healthy portfolio, with a greater scope of capital appreciation, as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields.We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ADM, Agilent Technologies A, Republic Services Inc. RSG, Deere &amp; Company DE and Cardinal Health Inc. CAH — that investors would love to buy this month.Why is Dividend Growth Better?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 21.Here are five of the 21 stocks that fit the bill:Illinois-based Archer-Daniels is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products.

Non-GAAP EPS was $1.62 for the fourth quarter and $7.48 for the full year of 2022. The declines in GAAP and non-GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter versus the prior year were primarily due to lower fourth quarter 2021 effective tax rates and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by strong underlying business performance. The GAAP EPS decline in the fourth quarter also reflects the unfavorable impact of losses from investments in equity securities compared with gains in the prior year. Full-year 2022 and 2021 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were negatively impacted by $0.22 and $0.65, respectively, related to an asset acquisition, and collaboration and licensing agreements.Non-GAAP EPS excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs (including pretax intangible asset impairment research and development [R&amp;D] charges of $780 million and $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter and full year of 2022, respectively, largely related to nemtabrutinib) and restructuring costs, as well as income and losses from investments in equity securities.In 2022, the company changed the treatment of certain items for purposes of its non-GAAP reporting. Results for 2021 have been recast to conform to the new presentation.

(Moderna), positive topline results from the Phase 2b KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 trial, which showed that KEYTRUDA in combination with mRNA-4157/V940, an investigational personalized mRNA therapeutic cancer vaccine, demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival versus KEYTRUDA alone for the adjuvant treatment of patients with stage III/IV melanoma following complete resection.In collaboration with Seagen Inc. and Astellas Pharma Inc., acceptance by the FDA for priority review of the supplemental Biologics License Application for KEYTRUDA in combination with Padcev®3 (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who are not eligible to receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.Positive topline results from the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-859 trial investigating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.Positive topline results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-966 trial investigating KEYTRUDA in combination with standard of care chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin) for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or unresectable biliary tract cancer.Merck announced that Lynparza (olaparib), an oral PARP inhibitor being co-developed and co-commercialized with AstraZeneca, was approved in the European Union (EU) in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated, based on the Phase 3 PROpel trial.Vaccine Program HighlightsMerck announced that an updated systematic literature review of 138 peer-reviewed studies observed that use of GARDASIL [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant] led to reductions in the rates of high-grade (precancerous) and low-grade cervical lesions, as well as reductions in certain non-cervical HPV-related diseases and HPV infection in women and men.Cardiovascular Program HighlightsMerck will present results from the Phase 3 STELLAR study evaluating investigational sotatercept for the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, and from the Phase 2 study evaluating MK-0616, the company’s investigational oral macrocyclic peptide PCSK9 inhibitor for the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia, at the American College of Cardiology’s 72nd Annual Scientific Session together with the World Heart Federation’s World Congress of Cardiology (ACC.23/WCC). Merck will host an investor event at ACC.23/WCC on March 6, 2023, to discuss these results. Further details will be announced at a later date.Business Development HighlightsMerck announced and successfully completed the acquisition of Imago BioSciences, Inc. (Imago), for an approximate total equity value of $1.35 billion, expanding Merck’s growing hematology portfolio.Merck announced that it has expanded its relationship and entered into an exclusive license and collaboration agreement with Kelun-Biotech (a holding subsidiary of Sichuan Kelun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd) to develop up to seven investigational preclinical antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for the treatment of cancer.Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) UpdatesMerck was named one of America’s most JUST companies by JUST Capital and CNBC, ranking No. 1 in the pharmaceuticals and biotech industry for the third straight year and No. 26 overall of all companies named.Merck published its Sustainability Bond Allocation Report, which highlighted how the company’s initial $1.0 billion sustainability bond is helping to drive progress across ESG focus areas.Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year Revenue PerformanceThe following table reflects sales of the company’s top pharmaceutical products, as well as sales of Animal Health products.$ in millionsFourth QuarterYear Ended20222021ChangeChangeEx-ExchangeDec. 31,2022Dec. 31,2021ChangeChangeEx-ExchangeTotal Sales$13,830$13,5212%8%$59,283$48,70422%26%Pharmaceutical12,18012,0391%9%52,00542,75422%28%KEYTRUDA5,4504,57719%26%20,93717,18622%27%GARDASIL / GARDASIL 91,4701,528-4%6%6,8975,67322%27%LAGEVRIO825952-13%2%5,684952******JANUVIA / JANUMET9131,393-34%-29%4,5135,288-15%-9%PROQUAD, M-M-R II and VARIVAX5265093%6%2,2412,1355%7%BRIDION4414361%7%1,6851,53210%16%Lynparza*2922689%14%1,11698913%18%Lenvima*2162065%9%87670424%28%ROTATEQ139213-35%-31%783807-3%0%SIMPONI166206-19%-8%706825-14%-4%Animal Health1,2301,261-2%6%5,5505,5680%6%Livestock8147913%12%3,3003,2950%7%Companion Animals416470-11%-5%2,2502,273-1%4%Other Revenues**42022190%-25%1,728382***87%*Alliance revenue for this product represents Merck’s share of profits, which are product sales net of cost of sales and commercialization costs.**Other revenues are comprised primarily of revenues from third-party manufacturing arrangements and miscellaneous corporate revenues, including revenue-hedging activities.***&gt;100%Pharmaceutical RevenueFourth-quarter pharmaceutical sales grew 1% to $12.2 billion. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, pharmaceutical sales grew 9%, primarily driven by oncology and hospital acute care, partially offset by diabetes.Growth in oncology was largely driven by higher sales of KEYTRUDA, which rose 19% to $5.5 billion in the quarter. Global sales growth of KEYTRUDA reflects continued strong momentum from metastatic indications including certain types of NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) cancers, and increased uptake across recent earlier-stage launches, including certain types of neoadjuvant/adjuvant TNBC in the U.S. Also contributing to growth in oncology was increased alliance revenue from Lynparza, which grew 9% to $292 million, driven primarily by higher demand in the U.S. In addition, sales of WELIREG (belzutifan), an oral hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha inhibitor, increased to $40 million due to continued uptake in the U.S. following the product’s launch in 2021.Growth in hospital acute care reflects higher sales of ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam), a combination cephalosporin antibacterial and beta-lactamase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with certain bacterial infections. ZERBAXA sales of $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 increased from $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, reflecting uptake from the completion of the phased resupply in 2022 that was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021. Growth in hospital acute care also reflects higher sales of PREVYMIS (letermovir), a medicine for prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients of an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, which increased 17% to $118 million, reflecting higher demand globally.Vaccines sales performance reflects lower combined sales of GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant), vaccines to prevent certain cancers and other diseases caused by HPV, which declined 4% to $1.5 billion. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 sales grew 6%, reflecting higher demand outside of the U.S., particularly in China. Vaccines sales performance also reflects lower sales of PNEUMOVAX 23 (pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent), a vaccine to help prevent pneumococcal disease, which declined 50% to $145 million, primarily reflecting lower U.S. demand as the market continues to shift toward newer adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. In addition, sales of ROTATEQ (Rotavirus Vaccine, Live Oral, Pentavalent), a vaccine to help protect against rotavirus gastroenteritis in infants and children, declined 35% to $139 million, primarily due to lower sales in China, which benefited in the fourth quarter of 2021 from increased supply, and lower sales in the U.S. largely due to the timing of public-sector purchases. Vaccines sales performance benefited from the ongoing pediatric launch of VAXNEUVANCE (Pneumococcal 15-valent Conjugate Vaccine), a vaccine to help prevent invasive pneumococcal disease, which had sales of $138 million, largely due to inventory stocking in the U.S.Pharmaceutical sales growth was partially offset by lower combined sales of JANUVIA (sitagliptin) and JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCI), for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, which declined 34% to $913 million, primarily reflecting generic competition in certain international markets, particularly in Europe and the Asia Pacific region, and lower demand and net pricing in the U.S.Sales of LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir), an investigational oral antiviral COVID-19 medicine, decreased 13% to $825 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, sales increased 2%, primarily driven by strong growth in Japan and the U.K. and the launch in Australia, offset by a decline in the U.S.Full-year 2022 pharmaceutical sales grew 22% to $52.0 billion. Pharmaceutical sales growth was 16% excluding LAGEVRIO and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, primarily driven by higher sales in oncology, particularly KEYTRUDA, higher sales of vaccines, reflecting strong growth of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 and the ongoing pediatric launch of VAXNEUVANCE, as well as growth in hospital acute care products, including ZERBAXA and BRIDION (sugammadex) injection 100 mg/mL, a medicine for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium bromide or vecuronium bromide in adults and pediatric patients ages 2 years and older undergoing surgery. Pharmaceutical sales growth in 2022 was partially offset by lower sales of JANUVIA and JANUMET, primarily reflecting lower demand in Europe as a result of generic competition, and a decline in PNEUMOVAX 23 sales as the U.S. market continues to shift toward newer adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. COVID-19-related disruptions negatively affected sales in 2022, but to a lesser extent than in 2021, which benefited year-over-year sales growth.Animal Health RevenueAnimal Health sales totaled $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, a 2% decline compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, Animal Health sales increased 6%. Sales growth of livestock products reflects higher demand, notably in the ruminant and poultry product portfolio, which includes technology solutions products, as well as higher pricing. Sales of companion animal products were negatively impacted by a reduction in veterinary visits in the broader companion animal market following the more favorable trend during the pandemic, as well as supply constraints for certain vaccines, partially offset by higher pricing.Full-year 2022 Animal Health sales were $5.5 billion, in line with the prior year. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, Animal Health sales grew 6%, primarily due to higher pricing. Full-year sales growth was also driven by higher demand of livestock products, led by ruminant, poultry and swine products. Sales of companion animal products also reflect higher demand for the BRAVECTO (fluralaner) parasiticide line of products, which had sales of $1.0 billion, partially offset by supply constraints for certain vaccines.Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year Expense, EPS and Related InformationThe tables below present selected expense information.$ in millionsFourth Quarter 2022GAAPAcquisition-andDivestiture-Related Costs4RestructuringCosts(Income) LossFromInvestments inEquitySecuritiesCertainOtherItemsNon-GAAP2Cost of sales$3,881$482$38$-$-$3,361Selling, general and administrative2,6873920--2,628Research and development3,775740---3,035Restructuring costs49-49---Other (income) expense, net(75)(69)-80-(86)Fourth Quarter 2021Cost of sales$3,873$419$47$-$(4)$3,411Selling, general and administrative2,83022610--2,594Research and development3,0683977--2,664Restructuring costs174-174---Other (income) expense, net(333)(3)-(381)-51$ in millionsYear Ended Dec. 31, 2022GAAPAcquisition-andDivestiture-Related Costs4RestructuringCosts(Income) LossFromInvestments inEquitySecuritiesCertainOtherItemsNon-GAAP2Cost of sales$17,411$2,059$205$-$-$15,147Selling, general and administrative10,04217694--9,772Research and development13,5481,67630--11,842Restructuring costs337-337---Other (income) expense, net1,501(207)-1,348-360Year Ended Dec. 31, 2021Cost of sales$13,626$1,607$160$-$221$11,638Selling, general and administrative9,63432219--9,293Research and development12,24547928--11,738Restructuring costs661-661---Other (income) expense, net(1,341)76-(1,884)-467GAAP Expense, EPS and Related InformationGross margin was 71.9% for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with 71.4% for the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase primarily reflects favorable product mix and foreign exchange. Gross margin was 70.6% for the full year of 2022 compared to 72.0% for the full year of 2021. The decline primarily reflects the unfavorable impacts of higher amortization of intangible assets, as well as higher revenue from third-party manufacturing arrangements and sales of LAGEVRIO, both of which have lower gross margins. The full-year gross margin decline was partially offset by the favorable effects of product mix, foreign exchange and charges in the prior year related to the discontinuation of COVID-19 development programs.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease primarily reflects lower acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and the favorable effect of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher promotional spending, as well as higher administrative costs. Full-year SG&amp;A expenses were $10.0 billion, an increase of 4% compared to the full year of 2021. The increase primarily reflects higher administrative costs, as well as higher promotional spending, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange and lower acquisition- and divestiture-related costs.R&amp;D expenses were $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 23% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher intangible asset impairment charges related to nemtabrutinib, which were $780 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with $275 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, lower reimbursement of LAGEVRIO R&amp;D costs from Ridgeback Biotherapeutics (Ridgeback), higher compensation and benefit costs reflecting in part increased headcount to support expanded clinical development activity, and higher clinical development spending. R&amp;D expenses were $13.5 billion for the full year of 2022, an increase of 11% compared with the full year of 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher intangible asset impairment charges, which were $1.7 billion in 2022 compared with $275 million in 2021, largely related to nemtabrutinib, $690 million of charges in 2022 related to collaboration and licensing agreements with Moderna, Orna Therapeutics (Orna) and Orion Corporation (Orion), as well as higher compensation and benefit costs and clinical development spending. The increase was partially offset by a $1.7 billion charge in the prior year for the acquisition of Pandion Therapeutics, Inc. (Pandion).Other (income) expense, net, was $75 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $333 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2021. Other (income) expense, net, was $1.5 billion of expense in the full year of 2022 compared to $1.3 billion of income in the full year of 2021. The change in both periods is primarily due to net losses from investments in equity securities in 2022 compared with net gains from investments in equity securities in 2021.The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2022 of 14.1% reflects the unfavorable impact of a higher than anticipated full-year rate of 11.7% due to a less favorable mix of income and expense than previously anticipated, while the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 of 2.2% reflects the favorable impact of a lower than previously expected full-year 2021 rate of 11.0%.GAAP EPS was $1.18 for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $1.51 for the fourth quarter of 2021. GAAP EPS was $5.71 for the full year of 2022 compared to $4.86 for the full year of 2021.Non-GAAP Expense, EPS and Related InformationNon-GAAP gross margin was 75.7% for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to 74.8% for the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase primarily reflects the favorable effects of product mix and foreign exchange. Non-GAAP gross margin was 74.4% for the full year of 2022 compared to 76.1% for the full year of 2021. The decrease primarily reflects the impact of higher revenue from third-party manufacturing arrangements and sales of LAGEVRIO, both of which have lower gross margins, partially offset by the favorable effects of product mix and foreign exchange.Non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses were $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses for the full year were $9.8 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the full year of 2021. The increase in both periods primarily reflects higher administrative costs, as well as higher promotional spending, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange.Non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses were $3.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 14% compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily driven by lower reimbursement of LAGEVRIO R&amp;D costs from Ridgeback, higher compensation and benefit costs reflecting in part increased headcount to support expanded clinical development activity, and higher clinical development spending. Non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses were $11.8 billion for the full year of 2022, an increase of 1% compared with the full year of 2021. The increase was primarily driven by $690 million of charges in 2022 related to collaboration and licensing agreements with Moderna, Orna and Orion, as well as higher compensation and benefit costs and clinical development spending. The increase was partially offset by a $1.7 billion charge in the prior year for the acquisition of Pandion.Non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, was $86 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $51 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, was $360 million of expense in the full year of 2022 compared to $467 million of expense in the full year of 2021.The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2022 of 15.6% reflects the unfavorable impact of a higher than anticipated full-year rate of 14.2% due to a less favorable mix of income and expense than previously anticipated, while the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 of 4.3% reflects the favorable impact of a lower than previously expected full-year 2021 rate of 12.4%.Non-GAAP EPS was $1.62 for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $1.81 for the fourth quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP EPS was $7.48 for the full year of 2022 compared to $5.37 for the full year of 2021.A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income and EPS is provided in the table that follows.$ in millions, except EPS amountsFourth QuarterYear Ended20222021Dec. 31, 2022Dec. 31, 2021EPSGAAP EPS$1.18$1.51$5.71$4.86Difference0.440.301.770.51Non-GAAP EPS that excludes items listed below2$1.62$1.81$7.48$5.37Net IncomeGAAP net income1$3,017$3,820$14,519$12,345Difference1,1127724,4861,278Non-GAAP net income that excludes items listed below1,2$4,129$4,592$19,005$13,623Decrease (Increase) in Net Income Due to Excluded Items:Acquisition- and divestiture-related costs4$1,192$1,039$3,704$2,484Restructuring costs107238666868Loss (income) from investments in equity securities80(381)1,348(1,884)Charges for the discontinuation of COVID-19 development programs---221Other-(4)--Net decrease (increase) in income before taxes1,3798925,7181,689Income tax (benefit) expense5(267)(120)(1,232)(411)Decrease (increase) in net income$1,112$772$4,486$1,278Financial OutlookThe following table summarizes the company’s full-year 2023 financial guidance.GAAPNon-GAAP2Revenue*$57.2 to $58.7 billion$57.2 to $58.7 billionGross marginApproximately 73%Approximately 77%Operating expenses**$23.3 to $24.3 billion$23.1 to $24.1 billionEffective tax rate17% to 18%17% to 18%EPS***$5.86 to $6.01$6.80 to $6.95*Includes approximately $1.0 billion of LAGEVRIO sales.

EPS guidance for 2023 assumes a share count (assuming dilution) of approximately 2.55 billion shares.Merck anticipates full-year 2023 revenue to be between $57.2 billion and $58.7 billion, including a negative impact of foreign exchange of approximately 2% at mid-January 2023 exchange rates. The company expects a significant decline in sales of LAGEVRIO, which are expected to be approximately $1.0 billion.Merck expects full-year 2023 GAAP EPS to be between $5.86 and $6.01.Merck expects full-year 2023 non-GAAP EPS to be between $6.80 and $6.95, including a negative impact of foreign exchange of approximately 4%. The non-GAAP range excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, costs related to restructuring programs, as well as income and losses from investment in equity securities.In the fourth quarter of 2022, Merck announced the acquisition of Imago for an approximate total value of $1.35 billion and a license and collaboration agreement with Kelun-Biotech, which includes an upfront payment of $175 million. The Imago acquisition closed in January 2023 and the collaboration with Kelun-Biotech is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, resulting in the inclusion of an aggregate $1.4 billion of R&amp;D expenses in Merck’s GAAP and non-GAAP results for the first quarter and full year of 2023. The Imago acquisition is also anticipated to result in an approximate 1 percentage point unfavorable impact to Merck’s expected full-year 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates. The impact of these two transactions on expected full-year 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS is approximately $0.53. GAAP and non-GAAP EPS in 2022 were negatively impacted by $0.22 of charges related to the collaboration and licensing agreements with Moderna, Orna and Orion.Operating expenses include incremental R&amp;D spending to advance the development of the Imago and Kelun-Biotech programs, as well as other promising programs related to the collaboration and licensing agreements with Moderna, Orna and Orion.The financial outlook does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions.A reconciliation of anticipated 2023 GAAP EPS to non-GAAP EPS and the items excluded from non-GAAP EPS are provided in the table below.$ in millions, except EPS amountsFull Year 2023GAAP EPS$5.86 to $6.01Difference$0.94Non-GAAP EPS that excludes items listed below2$6.80 to $6.95Acquisition- and divestiture-related costs$2,500Restructuring costs400(Income) loss from investments in equity securities(20)Net decrease (increase) in income before taxes$2,880Estimated income tax (benefit) expense(480)Decrease (increase) in net income$2,400Earnings Conference CallInvestors, journalists and the general public may access a live audio webcast of the earnings conference call on Thursday, Feb. 2, at 8:00 a.m. ET via this weblink.

Keytruda has played an instrumental role in driving Merck’s steady revenue growth in the past few years.Keytruda is already approved for the treatment of many cancers globally. Keytruda sales in the fourth quarter are likely to have been driven by continued strong momentum in metastatic indications, including in some types of NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, TNBC and MSI-H cancers and rapid uptake across recent earlier-stage launches. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Keytruda’s sales is $5.57 billion, while our estimate is $5.62 billion.Merck’s stock has risen 31.8% in the past year compared with an increase of 9.1% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the United States, Keytruda is expected to show strong growth across all types of cancers, including uptake from launches in earlier-stage cancers, including triple-negative breast, renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Keytruda is presently approved to treat six indications in earlier-stage cancers in the United States.In outside U.S. market, growth is likely to have been driven by lung cancer indications and head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Last quarter, Merck said it is witnessing a strong start to recently approved earlier stage indications. It remains to be seen how sales in early-stage cancers picked up in the fourth quarter.Merck’s HPV vaccine, Gardasil, is expected to be another key top-line driver in the fourth quarter. Gardasil’s ex-U.S. sales are expected to have been driven by strong demand in China and increased supply in the fourth quarter. The favorable timing of CDC purchasing, which benefited U.S. sales in the third quarter, is likely to have reversed in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gardasil is $1.5 billion, while our estimate is $1.45 billion.Story continuesOverall, strong global underlying demand across its business, particularly for Keytruda and Gardasil, is likely to have boosted sales growth in the fourth quarter like several previous quarters.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderMerck has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.

MRK may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Merck &amp; Co. is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MRK in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MRK, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.19% heading into earnings season.Merck &amp; Co., Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMerck &amp; Co., Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMerck &amp; Co., Inc. price-eps-surprise | Merck &amp; Co., Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that MRK has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

(NYSE:ROK) has been reasonably good and CEO Blake Moret has done a decent job of steering the company in the right direction. As shareholders go into the upcoming AGM on 07 February 2023, CEO compensation will probably not be their focus, but rather the steps management will take to continue the growth momentum. We present our case of why we think CEO compensation looks fair. View our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation Comparing Rockwell Automation, Inc.'s CEO Compensation With The IndustryOur data indicates that Rockwell Automation, Inc. has a market capitalization of US$32b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$11m for the year to September 2022. We note that's a decrease of 19% compared to last year. While we always look at total compensation first, our analysis shows that the salary component is less, at US$1.2m.On comparing similar companies in the American Electrical industry with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, we found that the median total CEO compensation was US$13m. This suggests that Rockwell Automation remunerates its CEO largely in line with the industry average. What's more, Blake Moret holds US$19m worth of shares in the company in their own name, indicating that they have a lot of skin in the game.Component20222021Proportion (2022)SalaryUS$1.2mUS$1.1m11%OtherUS$9.8mUS$12m89%Total CompensationUS$11mUS$14m100%Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 15% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 85% of the pie. It's interesting to note that Rockwell Automation allocates a smaller portion of compensation to salary in comparison to the broader industry. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance.ceo-compensationA Look at Rockwell Automation, Inc.'s Growth NumbersRockwell Automation, Inc.'s earnings per share (EPS) grew 5.7% per year over the last three years. In the last year, its revenue is up 8.2%.Story continuesWe would argue that the improvement in revenue is good, but isn't particularly impressive, but the modest improvement in EPS is good. So there are some positives here, but not enough to earn high praise. Historical performance can sometimes be a good indicator on what's coming up next but if you want to peer into the company's future you might be interested in this free visualization of analyst forecasts.Has Rockwell Automation, Inc. Been A Good Investment?Boasting a total shareholder return of 45% over three years, Rockwell Automation, Inc. has done well by shareholders. As a result, some may believe the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar size.To Conclude...Given that the company's overall performance has been reasonable, the CEO remuneration policy might not be shareholders' central point of focus in the upcoming AGM. However, we still think that any proposed increase in CEO compensation will be examined closely to make sure the compensation is appropriate and linked to performance.While it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business. We did our research and spotted 1 warning sign for Rockwell Automation that investors should look into moving forward.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a different set of stocks.

You can only run on autopilot so long before you run out of gas, you wake up and you're over Utah,"" said Representative Sam Graves, a Republican who chairs the transportation panel.Billy Nolen, the head of aviation safety, has been acting FAA administrator since April 1 when Steve Dickson left halfway through his five-year term. The Senate Commerce Committee has yet to schedule a hearing on President Joe Biden's FAA nominee who has drawn fire from Republicans. Nolen declined to respond to Graves' criticism.After two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people in 2018 and 2019, Congress passed sweeping legislation to reform how the FAA certifies new aircraft.Lawmakers said in a 2020 report ""the FAA failed in its oversight of Boeing and its certification of the aircraft."" Last month, the FAA named two dozen experts to review Boeing’s safety management processes and safety culture.On Friday, the FAA told lawmakers it made changes to prevent a repeat of a computer system outage that led to the Jan. 11 groundstop.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Robert Birsel)]"

Though the broader market has been outperforming the defense sector this year, the sector still holds strength and has the potential to march higher in the coming days.Below, we highlight a few factors that are acting as tailwinds for the Aerospace &amp; Defense sector.Continued Geopolitical TensionIf the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war is not enough, some other parts of the world are also facing geopolitical tensions in one form or other. Iran’s defense ministry lately said one of its factories was attacked by drones in the city of Isfahan. However, it did not mention anything about the suspect. There was a terror attack in Israel's Jerusalem on Friday night.Rising M&amp;A Activity for AerospacePer HigherGov, there was solid acquisition activity in 2022 despite economic headwinds and rising rates. There were 433 Aerospace, Defense, and Government (ADG) transactions in 2022, the second largest number of transactions ever, down 10% from record 2021. The Defense Products and Services sector experienced a 12% uptick in transactions, fueled by defense spending in the United States and Europe to counter expanding nation-state threats. Continued geopolitical threats, robust company cashflows, and continued investment in critical technologies will likely fuel ADG transaction volumes in 2023 too.Comeback of BoeingOne of the strong pillars of the sector was Boeing, which had long been struggling with one crisis or another. First, its 737-Max aircraft met with serial accidents and then COVID-19-led slowdown in the airlines sector led Boeing to face difficulties in the past few years. But Boeing’s business has turned around of late. Boeing expects to hire 10,000 workers in 2023 as it recovers from the pandemic-induced and 737-Max-related crisis. The aircraft-maker plans to increase jetliner production, but will cut some support jobs, the U.S. plane maker said last week, as quoted on CNBC.Story continuesBoeing acknowledged that it will “lower staffing within some support functions,” a move meant to enable it to better align resources to support current products and technology development. It declined to comment on how many jobs it will cut in 2023.The company plans to increase deliveries of the 737 MAX from the 374 aircraft in 2022 to between 400 to 450 planes this year, with deliveries of the 787 expected to hit between 70 and 80 aircraft.This earnings season, Boeing reported its first positive free cash flow since 2018. The company reiterated it expects to generate $3 billion to $5 billion in free cash flow in 2023. Cheaper ValuationEven after beating the S&amp;P 500 last year, the sector has cheaper valuation with a forward P/E of 17.01X against the S&amp;P 500’s P/E of 17.97X. The sector’s price-to-book and price-to-sales ratios are 2.49X and 1.66X, respectively. Both data stand cheaper against the S&amp;P 500’s data of 5.08X and 2.65X, respectively.The sector’s projected EPS growth is 13.96% versus the S&amp;P 500’s EPS growth of 5.81%. Most importantly, the sector has a decent cash cushion that helps it ride out the turbulent macroeconomic times. The sector has a cash flow per share ratio at 3.94X. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will provide selected CH-47F components for the CH-47F Block II configuration. The jet giant will also provide remanufacturing components for CH-47F aircraft for Ordering Periods I and II to satisfy the congressional requirement.Importance of CH-47 ChinookBoeing’s CH-47 Chinook Block II helicopter boasts cutting-edge technologies that are most suitable for heavy-lift mission requirements. Additionally, Block II improves readiness for the U.S. Army and Special Operations warfighters, limits future sustainment costs and provides commonality across the fleet to ensure availability of the Chinook fleet for decades to come.Owing to its unrivaled production, maintenance and sustainment cost efficiencies, the helicopter enjoys a steady demand. Notably, 950 Chinooks are being deployed in 20 countries, which stands a testament to this helicopter’s solid demand. In fact, Boeing may continue to witness a steady flow of contracts involving CH-47 Chinook like the latest contract.Growth ProspectsThe tiff between Russia and Ukraine has compelled nations across the globe to increase their defense spending for fortifying their defense structure against any sudden assault. In fact, an increased spending has been witnessed for defense arms and ammunitions procurement. In this context, military helicopter that plays an integral part in any defense landscape is likely to witness a surge in demand.Per the GlobeNewswire report, the global rotorcraft market is likely to witness a CAGR of 4% over the 2022-2027 period.

For more companies, head on over to Top 5 Smartest Companies To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Surviving in the modern day corporate world is not for the faint of heart. Business is a ruthless endeavor, and shareholder and investor interest reign supreme for each company. The companies that have survived, and have turned into modern day giants and/or disrupted industries are ones that have beaten the competition by introducing unique products and services and capturing consumer attention through marketing campaigns. America, which has the largest and most developed corporate sector in the world (even the universe maybe, unless NASA finds aliens), is full of companies that disrupted industries and become corporate giants — even closing in on the African continent's GDP when it comes to market capitalization. Africa's nominal GDP is slated to be $3.14 trillion by 2023 according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), while the two most valuable American firms — Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) — have a combined market capitalization of $4.16 trillion.Both have led the charge and transformed entire industries. For Apple, its biggest strength is the manufacturing supply chain that enables it to pump out millions of iPhones each year. For Microsoft,  it has been the ability to target the highest growing industries and become a dominant player in them. The best example of this is the Azure cloud computing and data center platform, which grew 40% on a YoY basis in the second quarter of 2022.Marcin Balcerzak/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has taken a wager at trying to identify the smartest companies in the world.

We have achieved a 21.9% reduction in energy use intensity and a 30.8% reduction in GHG emissions intensity from our 2018 baseline, meeting our goal seven years before our original 2028 target, and we believe we are on track to achieve the same in indoor water use intensity. Additionally, we have updated 35% of our portfolio to maximize energy efficiency and now have 25 green-certified communities, with more in the pipeline.We also have a number of community engagement efforts underway and have reported our progress through our annual Corporate Sustainability Report, CDP disclosure, and GRESB assessment, the latter of which we have now improved year over year since our first submission in 2020. We will continue to focus on deepening engagement, establishing new targets, and building an integrated pathway for ESG, which is an integral component of our continued resiliency and creates a positive impact for our residents, associates, and investors.116th Consecutive Quarterly Common Dividend DeclaredMAA declared its 116th consecutive quarterly common dividend, which was paid on January 31, 2023 to holders of record on January 13, 2023. The current annual dividend rate is $5.60 per common share, an increase of 12% from the immediately prior rate. The timing and amount of future dividends will depend on actual cash flows from operations, MAA's financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and other factors as MAA's Board of Directors deems relevant. MAA's Board of Directors may modify the dividend policy from time to time.2023 Earnings and Same Store Portfolio GuidanceMAA is providing initial 2023 guidance for Net income per diluted common share, Core FFO per Share and Core AFFO per Share, along with its expectations for growth of Property revenue, Property operating expense and NOI for the Same Store Portfolio in 2023. MAA expects to update its 2023 Net income per diluted common share, Core FFO per Share and Core AFFO per Share guidance on a quarterly basis.FFO, Core FFO and Core AFFO are non-GAAP financial measures. Acquisition and disposition activity materially affects depreciation and capital gains or losses, which combined, generally represent the majority of the difference between Net income available for common shareholders and FFO. As discussed in the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures found later in this release, MAA's definition of FFO is in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts', or NAREIT's, definition, and Core FFO represents FFO further adjusted for items that are not considered part of MAA's core business operations. MAA believes that Core FFO is helpful in understanding operating performance in that Core FFO excludes not only depreciation expense of real estate assets and certain other non-routine items, but it also excludes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance.2023 GuidanceEarnings:Full Year 2023Earnings per common share - diluted$5.97 to $6.37Core FFO per Share - diluted$8.88 to $9.28Core AFFO per Share - diluted$7.96 to $8.36MAA Same Store Portfolio:Property revenue growth5.25% to 7.25%Property operating expense growth5.15% to 7.15%NOI growth5.30% to 7.30%MAA expects Core FFO for the first quarter of 2023 to be in the range of $2.14 to $2.30 per Share, or $2.22 per Share at the midpoint. MAA does not forecast Net income per diluted common share on a quarterly basis as MAA generally cannot predict the timing of forecasted acquisition and disposition activity within a particular quarter (rather than during the course of the full year). Additional details and guidance items are provided in the Supplemental Data to this release.Supplemental Material and Conference CallSupplemental data to this release can be found on the ""For Investors"" page of the MAA website at www.maac.com.

Evernorth, Cigna’s largest segment, includes a broad range of coordinated and point solution health services that include pharmacy services, benefits management, care solutions, and data analytics provided to health plans, employers, government organizations, and healthcare providers.Cigna’s other primary segment, Cigna Healthcare, comprises Cigna’s U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government, and International Health businesses that provide comprehensive medical and coordinated solutions to clients and customers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs for Regeneron, it offers investors unique exposure to biomedicine with the company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of treatments targeting serious medical conditions. Regeneron’s portfolio includes nine marketed drugs that treat serious eye diseases, asthma, arthritis, and lung cancer, among other diseases and health conditions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCigna Quarterly EstimatesCigna’s fourth-quarter earnings are expected at $4.84 per share, which would be up 1% from Q4 2021. Sales are forecasted to be virtually flat year over year for Q4 at $45.58 billion. This would round out Cigna’s fiscal 2022 with earnings up 13% at $23.14 per share and total sales rising 3% to $180.34 billion.Story continuesPlus, FY23 earnings are projected to rise another 7% to $24.81 per share with sales expected to jump another 5%. Even better, FY23 sales projections of $189.41 billion would represent 289% growth over the last five years with 2018 sales at $48.65 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegeneron Quarterly Estimates Pivoting to Regeneron, Q4 earnings are projected at $9.68 per share, a -59% decline from Q4 2021 EPS of $23.72 a share after an outstanding prior-year quarter. Fourth quarter sales are expected to be down -36% year over year to $3.17 billionRegeneron would round out fiscal 2022 with EPS at $42.50 compared to its mind-boggling earnings of $74.66 a share in 2021. Fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to dip another -3%. Total sales for fiscal 2022 would be down - 26% at $11.84 billion but are expected to rise 4% in FY23.More impressive, fiscal 2023 sales projections of $12.34 billion would still be an 84% increase over the last five years with 2018 sales at $6.71 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance &amp; Valuation Both Cigna and Regeneron stocks have indeed been valuable investments in terms of defensive safety acting as a hedge against inflation. Over the last year, Cigna stock is up +36% Vs. Regeneron’s +21% as both largely outperformed the S&amp;P 500’s -14% with the Nasdaq down -19%.Furthermore, in the last decade, Cigna’s +405% and Regeneron’s +354% have also topped the performance of the broader indexes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $313 per share and just 12.7X forward earnings, Cigna stock continues to stand out from a valuation standpoint. Shares of Cigna trade 37% beneath its decade-long high of 20.3X and are on par with the median of 12.4X.At around $758 a share and 20.6X forward earnings, Regeneron stock also trades attractively relative to its past. Shares of Regeneron trade 76% below its decade-long high of 86.4X and at a 24% discount to the median of 27X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line With healthcare insurance and biomedicine being very lucrative areas of the economy in terms of growth investors may want to consider adding Cigna and Regeneron stocks to their portfolios as they have continued to outperform the broader market.More importantly, the guidance and outlook the companies are able to give during the fourth quarter reports will give insight into the possibility of their strong performances and growth continuing with Cigna stock sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment and Regeneron landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $3.04 a share, just five days from its upcoming earnings release on February 6, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $3.04 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.65 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Skyworks Solutions has an Earnings ESP of 14.72%.SWKS is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Shopify (SHOP) as well.Shopify, which is readying to report earnings on February 15, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0 a share, and SHOP is 14 days out from its next earnings report.Shopify's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 100% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, SWKS and SHOP could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The deal has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. Valued at $481.6 million, the contract is expected to conclude by Jan 31, 2028.Significance of ProphetProphet is the 24-hour, all-weather, near-real-time, ground-based, tactical signal intelligence/electronic warfare capability that allows easy integration into a vehicle. It is equipped with Prophet Enhanced sensors and a Prophet Control, which enable actionable intelligence, situational understanding and force protection.Its remarkable features enable interoperability in the global signal intelligence enterprise. Prophet Enhanced delivers collected data to common databases for access by the intelligence community.Prophet Enhanced boasts beyond-line-of-sight capability, which is based on the present Project Manager Warfighter Information Network–Tactical (WIN-T) architecture. This capability allows an extended distance and performs distributed operations.As nations are enhancing their military capability, General Dynamics, the prime contractor of such a remarkably efficient and effective detector, is likely to continue to witness a strong order inflow. The latest contract win is a bright example of that. This is likely to boost the revenue generation prospects of the Mission Systems business unit.Growth ProspectsNations have increased their defense spending on military equipment and various arsenals to strengthen their defense capabilities. The surge in the demand for defense products was also driven by the tiff between Ukraine and Russia, which led many nations to amplify their defense inventory to deter any sudden assault.In such a scenario, military sensors for effective intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance signals for the early detection of any emerging threat have witnessed increased demand. This may continue to rise in the days ahead as the need to modernize and upgrade the defense structure to become more war-efficient may fuel the demand.Story continuesIn this context, per the report from Mordor Intelligence, the military sensor market is projected to witness a CAGR of 5% during the 2023-2028 period. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics as it enjoys an established position in the military sensor market.A few defense primes that can reap the benefits of the aforementioned market are Lockheed Martin LMT, Northrop Grumman NOC and BAE Systems BAESY.Northrop Grumman's capabilities in electronic warfare, full-spectrum cyber and electromagnetic maneuver warfare span all domains — land, sea, air, space, cyberspace and the electromagnetic spectrum.

They threw out Apple, Disney, Sony, Nike, a number of tech streaming Metaverse and sportswear companies. Could they be purchased this year, and who would be a likely candidate?SIMEON SIEGEL: Great question. Could they? Listen, everything could. I think the question is, should they, and the question is when and why, right? Why hasn't it happened yet? And so if I think about it, one of those companies, right, if we can just quickly go through those companies, one of them is Nike. We have found the athletic brands, Nike, Under Armour, Lulu, all bought connected fitness. And all of them have either walked away from it or written it down. I think we've talked about Lulu's Mirror purchase has gotten less than they hoped for. So I don't know that the athletic businesses want to get involved.Amazon is obviously already connected with the business. Amazon, on the other hand, is in the business of moving a lot of products that's not brand enhancing. So to the question of if they believe the TAM is large, but the brand can be eroded while doing it, then potentially, right? But what does Amazon get that they don't already have right now and that they're already selling the product? So that's them.Apple, from a branding perspective, I guess makes sense. I think the question I've always wondered-- and I don't cover Apple-- has always been, why wouldn't they have picked up this company earlier, right? If we're talking about just order of magnitude where Apple was during the COVID and where Peloton was during COVID, Peloton was up and to the right. Peloton had the eyeballs of everyone that they would have had. The engagement now has declined. The perception now has declined. So if you didn't buy before, are you looking now?Again, I don't know, but just throwing out the thought process that at least I would have when thinking about this. I think right now, Peloton is doing an excellent job flipping their own problems, working on the restructuring, cutting fixed costs. And I think the question is, does that lead to growth or not? You can be a healthy brand. You can be a smaller brand. And the reality is right now, you're getting a lot of credibility from Wall Street at $5 and 1/2 billion market. There's worse things in the world.]"

Look at these numbers-- up 25%, the company releasing its second quarter earnings report. Their CEO Barry McCarthy, who has been on a year-long hill ride telling investors in a letter today, quote, ""if you've been wondering whether or not Peloton can make an epic comeback, this quarter's results show the changes we're making are working.""Let's discuss this with BMO Managing Director Simeon Siegel. Simeon, nice to see you, sir. Epic comeback-- has it begun?SIMEON SIEGEL: Great-- great terminology. I'm just realizing, I think Barry and I are wearing similar clothes. So who wore it best over here? We're getting a nice little-- I think it's him. I think it's him.- [? You, ?] sir.SIMEON SIEGEL: But-- [LAUGHS] there you go. So listen, I think that if this was a traditional discretionary brand selling things, what we would be saying today is, this company beat revenues, to their credit, they've cut expenses, to their credit, but they also missed gross profit dollars.So we would be asking about what is the quality of this sale. And I that's important. But I want to stress, this was a company that was down in the dumps. People were worried about it. They beat their number. That's the-- that is the headline number.But we would be asking about that quality of sale. The immediate response should be, well, it's not a traditional discretionary brand, because they also have the monthly recurring revenue that comes from subscriptions. I think for that, we need to ask-- subscription revenue was actually down sequentially.And there's a timing element. But you have to ask the question for a business that's predicated-- again, it's not a small business-- $5 and 1/2 billion today of market cap-- why is that subscription revenue either flat, down a little bit? Why isn't it growing?Story continuesAnd so these are, I think, the questions where we have to internalize. Epic comeback effectively speaks to growth. I think what the company has done really well is restructuring and fixing a turnaround. I think we are far away from seeing growth.SEANA SMITH: Simeon, what do you make of the comments that we got from McCarthy just about questions about the viability of the business? He said that those questions have been put to bed. Do you agree with that?SIMEON SIEGEL: I agree. I do. I think so. I think that there was questions last year about existential risk to the Peloton brand and company-- sorry, more the company. I don't subscribe to those, but I haven't subscribed to those in a while.I think that the question here is what it should be worth. I think-- listen Seana, I think you and I have talked about this for a while. I think what's fascinating is if we-- if someone was sleeping the last three years, and they woke up and they just started reading about this company called Peloton, and they knew that it was started as a startup not long ago and now it's valued at the market at $5 and 1/2 billion, it would be viewed as a tremendous success.The problem is that we didn't fall asleep. We watched it do this. And so the perception that, oh, the company has been knocked down, I think we still need to internalize how many companies are not worth $5 and 1/2 billion. And so that's where I think there's a long way in between lack of viability and $5 and 1/2 billion. I think that's the conversation to be had.- How do we need to view them? It sounds as though we almost view them as a streaming company moving forward. That's where their margins are. They're losing money on the Bikes.SIMEON SIEGEL: They are. They are losing money on the Bikes. I think there's no way around that. And that's why I say that subscription revenue needs to be going up. And so the big question obviously right now is going to be, what does this member count look like a year from now, three years from now?We were looking at something that's interesting. The amount of subscribers within their first year, it's the lowest percentage of the total base that has ever existed. That's an obvious comment because during the pandemic, you were doubling your member base every year. You're now not.The problem with that is you're probably more likely to churn the longer you've had the Bike. And so within that context, I think we do-- right now, churn was OK. Churn was a good number over here. It was in line with what they expected-- up [? versus the ?] prior but still not bloated.But we're going to have to watch that, right? Because the point about streaming is you don't have to worry about bringing in that new dollar every day as long as the person stays with you. We like talking about CAC because it's a good-sounding acronym, but Cost Of Retention, CRC, doesn't sound as good. But that is important.And so I think, yeah. I think absolutely the question will be, what do you pay for a streaming business here? what is the ultimate TAM?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, so Simeon, so what do they need to do, then, to get the more subscribers, to get more members on their side involved with Peloton? Is it lowering the price? Is it something else that they should be doing that they haven't done for the last 12 months?SIMEON SIEGEL: So what are the rules of engagement here when we're doing this virtually? Am I allowed to throw this on you guys and say, hey, do you both have a Peloton? Are we allowed to play that game?SEANA SMITH: We do.- We both do.SEANA SMITH: We both do.SIMEON SIEGEL: When did you get it?SEANA SMITH: During the pandemic.SIMEON SIEGEL: [INAUDIBLE]SEANA SMITH: 2020.- Pre-pandemic.SIMEON SIEGEL: So the question is, if you bought a pair of pants during the pandemic, you can buy another pair of pants next year. You both had your Bikes already. Maybe you get a Tread. Maybe you get a Rower. Maybe you already have them. That doesn't add a subscriber.And so the dynamic-- the problem with recurring revenue is that you need to find someone new. And so I think there might simply be a point at which Peloton has obviously pulled forward a tremendous amount of that capacity of that demand. Will there always be new demand? Yes. Will it be to the amount-- is that 100 million number that has been thrown out there, does that seem feasible? Not based on the order of magnitude that we're going today.And so what's interesting is one of the responses that CEO McCarthy is talking about on the call is this notion of a digital app. Right now, it's declining. The argument here is this is, I think, the line-- there's a lot of fun words out there between ""epic comeback,"" between the Powell comments you were just making-- and I think ""path to the promised land"" was the term used for the digital app.We need to see that change. But that's a very different business than the Bike. There are a lot of digital apps out there, and the churn is much higher. So I think that path-- what do they need to do? I would actually argue what they should do is focus on the bare-- on these brand loyalists. Focus on the people that love the community.I also have a Bike, by the way. And actually maybe raise prices. Get the most you can out of the people like us that love the product. Because at the end of the day, luxury brands don't focus on selling everything to everyone. They focus on maximizing what they-- every unit that they drive.And I think that's going to be the question. Every brand has to determine balancing exclusivity and distribution. Netflix might not need to do that. Big streaming businesses might not need to do that. As soon as you introduce inventory and halo and luxury and brand image, that conversation changes.- The underrated part of the app is the meditation side of it, which I use every day and sometimes twice, if you need a little tip there, sir. An interesting letter from Blackwell Capital, though-- and I'm sure you've heard about this-- to Peloton suggesting some of the companies that would be better stewards that should buy Peloton. They threw out Apple, Disney, Sony, Nike, a number of tech streaming metaverse and sportswear companies.Could they be purchased this year? And who would be a likely candidate?SIMEON SIEGEL: Great question. Could they? Listen, everything could. I think the question is, should they? And the question is, when and why? Why hasn't it happened yet?So if I think about it-- one of those companies, right-- if we just quickly go through those companies, one of them is Nike. We have found the athletic brands, Nike, Under Armor, Lulu, all bought connected fitness, and all of them have either walked away from it or written it down. I think we've talked about Lulu's Mirror purchase has gone less than they hoped for. So I don't know that the athletic businesses want to get involved.Amazon is obviously already connected with the business. Amazon, on the other hand, is in the business of moving a lot of products. That's not brand enhancing. So to the question of if they believe the TAM is large but the brand can be eroded while doing it, then potentially, right? But what does Amazon get that they don't already have right now, [? now that ?] they're already selling the product? So that's them.Apple, from a branding perspective, I guess makes sense. I think the question I've always wondered-- and I don't cover Apple-- has always been, why wouldn't they have picked up this company earlier? If we're talking about just order of magnitude where Apple was during COVID and where Peloton was during COVID, Peloton was up and to the right.Peloton had the eyeballs of everyone that they would have had. The engagement now has declined. The perception now has declined. So if you didn't buy before, are you looking now? Again, I don't know, but just throwing out the thought process that at least I would have when thinking about this.I think right now, Peloton is doing an excellent job flipping their own problems, working on the restructuring, cutting fixed costs. And I think the question is, does that lead to growth or not? You can be a healthy brand. You can be a smaller brand. And the reality is right now, you're getting a lot of credibility from Wall Street at $5 and 1/2 billion market cap. There's worse things in the world.- I keep nudging Netflix to buy them, but they're not listening, my friend. You cover Nike. You mentioned Nike. Have to get your thoughts on what might be the greatest collaboration in the history of fashion-- Tiffany &amp; Co., Nike's Air Force Ones. They come out March 7 for $400. The little blue shoe box-- that is just glorious.Have you seen these things? What do you think?SIMEON SIEGEL: Yeah, we saw the social drops that happened over the weekend and, like any sneaker head I guess, got very excited. Listen, Nike had a-- collaborations are the best gift to the retail world because collaborations, whether they're Nike and Tiffany, or whether it's Supreme putting their logo on an Oreo, just is the beauty.We talk about the branding with Peloton and social-- and just human psychology, right? This is-- it'll sell out. It won't be needle moving to Nike. But the point is, this is what they do. And they've had really good relationships and really good collaborations with prior LVMH brands.So I think this, at the end of the day, is great for brand enhancement, great for marketing. We're talking about it now. Do I think it will impact-- am I going to change my model based on it? No, but that doesn't make it any less cool.- But you want them, right? Let's be clear.SIMEON SIEGEL: Want-- [LAUGHS] who doesn't? Who doesn't?- OK, good. Just want to--SEANA SMITH: He clearly does. It's ""the greatest collaboration in the history of fashion."" That's a big endorsement.- I'll be on the SNKRS App the second those drop. And I won't get them, but I will try.SEANA SMITH: 400 bucks, though.SIMEON SIEGEL: Good luck. Good luck. You will not get them, but you can buy them on some reseller site because some 12-year-old will be faster than you are.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. And for even more-- double, triple that. All right, Simeon Siegel, thanks so much as always.- No doubt.]"

If you want to see more companies in this selection, check out 5 Most Valuable Retail Companies In The World. Retailers are facing challenges due to the rapid changes happening in the industry. Only a small portion of executives are confident about increasing profits in the upcoming year. Most expect inflation to affect their margins and anticipate a decrease in consumer spending due to financial worries. Despite the challenges, retailers have developed resilience in recent years. The pandemic caused significant changes in consumer demand, which led retailers to modernize their systems to better adapt to these changes. This includes improved analytics and strategies to maintain customer loyalty in response to changing consumer preferences.The Retail Industry: An AnalysisAccording to Deloitte, retail sales growth is expected to be limited by a slowing economy. In a baseline scenario with a 55% chance of happening, GDP growth is predicted to decrease from 2% in 2022 to 0.9% in 2023. Although a strong labor market will continue to drive sales, there is a risk of a recession which could lead to economic contraction and higher unemployment.Physical retail stores and online platforms are becoming important sources of advertising for vendors. Retailers are earning more revenue by selling marketing space to vendors, which strengthens their partnerships. The sale of advertising space on websites, in-store displays, mobile apps, and streaming services is expected to increase among retailers, with the greatest growth coming from streaming TV.The top retailers in the US are at the forefront of maximizing retail media networks. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was quick to use its acquisition of Thursday Night Football streaming to sell advertising space to vendors and enhance its marketing. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)’s partnership with Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU) to sell commercials on the ad-supported CTV will become even stronger if its potential merger with Albertsons goes ahead. Similarly, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has a long history of working with vendors on retail media networks and has created its own network called Walmart Connect, which generated over $2 billion in revenue in 2021. The growth of advertising revenue, excluding website placements, is expected to increase 38% in 2023, reaching $6.5 billion. The growth of social commerce offers a new opportunity for retailers and brands. Story continuesIn addition to exploring the most valuable retail companies in the world, investors can also check out 15 Internet Retail Stocks To Buy, 10 Best Retail Stocks To Buy Now, and Largest Retailers in the US. Our Methodology We used stock screeners to identify the most valuable retail companies in the world based on market capitalization as of January 31, 2023.

The company reported another solid quarterly update that highlighted particularly robust growth in its commercial segment, market share gains, and stable gross margins.

Strength in the second quarter was driven by better-than-expected sales of consumable items. Guidance for the remainder of the year was increased. In addition to solid earnings, forecasts for the increasing expectations of a recession drove positive sentiment towards consumer discretionary companies with more predictable revenue like dollar stores.”12. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Market Capitalization as of January 31: $78.566 BillionTarget Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is a general merchandise retailer in the United States, offering food assortments, grocery, apparel, accessories, home decor products, electronics, toys, seasonal offerings, beauty products, and household essentials.

Although sales were slightly better than expected, Target saw a slowdown in discretionary sales. Gross margins were below expectations with higher markdowns, increased shrink, and incremental costs. Long-term, we expect Target to be able to return to operating margins in the 6% to 8% range as inventories return to normal levels as well as seeing a normalization in supply chain costs.”11.

(NYSE:TJX) in its fourth quarter 2022 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the Consumer Discretionary sector was the largest positive contributor to our relative performance, in part driven by contributions from The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX). TJX is a leading off-price apparel and home goods retailer. After a couple of years of bumpy performance due to closing stores during the height of the pandemic and absorbing rising supply chain costs, sales and margins have reverted towards more normal levels. We believe TJX’s consumer value proposition remains terrific and they will continue to gobble up market share from department stores over the long term.”10. JD.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:JD) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We sold JD as a result of the furor over Chinese stocks during the quarter. We had been concerned about China’s lack of respect for investor rights for some time, and Beijing has become significantly more aggressive in asserting itself of late. In addition, the legal structure Chinese companies use to come public in the U.S., a Cayman Islands shell corporation leaves American investors with an unsure path to recovering value should these companies cease to trade on U.S. exchanges. Because of the uncertainty, we exited our position in JD completely. We still love JD’s long-term prospects, but we cannot estimate the legal/regulatory risk associated with these companies anymore. More broadly, we are freeing up cash for some other positions we already own which have declined in this market, and after additional review, remain attractive.”9. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Market Capitalization as of January 31: $115.255 BillionCVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) was founded in 1963 and is headquartered in Woonsocket, Rhode Island.

It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”8.

(NYSE:LOW) is the second-largest home improvement center in the U.S. The company has several competitive advantages including scale, distribution efficiencies, interconnected retail through stores/internet, excellent management, and a strong balance sheet. The company is valued at only 14 times estimated earnings per share versus its long-term average P/E multiple of approximately 18 times estimated earnings per share.The shares of Lowe’s Companies, Inc. increased 7% in the most recent quarter following better-than-expected quarterly business results. Lowe’s is the second largest home improvement center in the U.S. The company has several competitive advantages including scale, distribution efficiencies, interconnected retail through stores/internet, excellent management, and a strong balance sheet.

(NYSE:NKE) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Adobe and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) were solid performers in the quarter as some of the doom and gloom narratives around these companies have waned as they both saw strong recent business results. Nike has been dealing with weak demand in China (mostly due to rolling COVID lockdowns) but also a bloated inventory position in North American apparel as well. Supply chain issues caused delays in last year’s inventory shipments. As those were overcome, newer orders came in earlier than expected causing the spike in inventory. On its most recent earnings call, it became clear to us that this inventory spike is a temporary supply issue and narrowly focused in apparel. Demand for Nike products is strong, especially for footwear where nearly every geography grew over 30% in constant currencies in the past quarter. The company expects the inventory issue to be largely behind it in the next two to three quarters and is already seeing inventory levels decline sequentially.”6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Market Capitalization as of January 31: $224.875 BillionCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates membership warehouses in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, France, Iceland, China, and Taiwan, offering branded and private-label merchandise products.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the leading retail companies worldwide.Madison Funds made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins.

Corporation QuoteKey Factors to NoteOn Dec 6, V.F. Corp trimmed its outlook for fiscal 2023, implying soft performance in the to-be-reported quarter. The company expected its second half of fiscal 2023 to reflect the impacts of lower-than-expected consumer demand across its business categories, mostly in North America. The reduced demand is likely to have resulted in a heightened promotional environment and wholesale order cancellations to manage inventory levels. The impacts of these trends are expected to have pulled down the top line in the fiscal third quarter.V.F. Corp also expected the reduced consumer discretionary spending in Europe due to inflationary pressures and ongoing pandemic-related disturbances in China to affect its performance in the second half of fiscal 2023. Consequently, V.F. Corp anticipates revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2023 to be slightly below the previous view, suggesting a 3-4% increase in constant dollars (excluding foreign currency translations).Additionally, the company expects SG&amp;A deleverage throughout fiscal 2023 due to lower volumes. This, along with the promotional environment in North America, is likely to weigh on the bottom-line performance for the to-be-reported quarter.On the positive front, V.F. Corp has been witnessing strength across its brands for a while. VFC’s brand portfolio, and strength in the outdoor, active, streetwear and workwear units have been tailwinds. In addition, VFC has been benefiting from Supreme’s strong follower base among the younger generation.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for V.F.

Then covid happened, and for the pharmaceutical companies that came up with vaccines against it, in particular Pfizer and Moderna, it was a bonanza. Billions of people globally needed one—no, two; actually, three; or four!—shots. Governments, especially wealthy ones, placed big orders, buying upfront many more vaccines than their populations needed.This made of Comirnaty (Pfizer’s mRNA covid vaccine) the drug with the highest annual revenue in history, two years in a row. In 2021, the pharmaceutical giant reached nearly $37 billion in sales of its covid vaccine. In 2022, it sales were close to $38 billion. On top of it, the company generated about $19 billion in sales with Paxlovid, its covid treatment.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureCombined, these two products made 2022 a golden year for the drugmaker, which brought home more than $100 billion in revenue, reflecting 30% operational growth. The company reported in its call with investors on Jan. 31 that 2022 was the year with the highest revenue in its history.But 2023 won’t be as good. Not even remotely. The company expects to bring home between $67 billion and $71 billion in revenue this year, following a drastic reduction in sales from covid products.A lot less money—but still a lot of moneyGovernments, and especially the US, which has been the biggest purchaser of Pfizer’s vaccine since its launch, are reducing—or outright ending—their vaccine and covid therapeutics buying programs. This has prompted Pfizer to hike the price of the vaccine as high as $130 per dose—about $100 more than it cost the government to purchase it.Yet the price hike won’t make up for the anticipated reduction in vaccine sales: Pfizer expects its revenue from the shot to go down 64% in 2023, for a forecast of $13.5 billion. The destiny of Paxlovid won’t be different. The company estimates its sales will go down 58% this year to $8 billion.Story continuesNot only will the sales likely be smaller, but also less predictable: Governments placed advanced orders and paid even for the doses they didn’t end up needing. The commercial market brings the risk of producing doses that go unsold, which is one of the reasons Pfizer has used to justify its price hike.Unless severe new variants emerge, the change in projected covid vaccine and therapeutics sales signals the progressing of a downward trend: The percentage of people receiving new doses of covid vaccines has been going down significantly with each new round of boosters and will likely continue to do so.Even with dramatically reduced revenue, Corminaty would continue to be one of the world’s top three bestselling drugs in 2023. Cancer drug Keytruda, made by Merck, would be in first place with $21 billion in sales. AbbVie’s Humira—which generated revenue for $22 billion in 2022—could follow, though the maker expects a drastic reduction in sales (around 45%) after biosimilars enter the US market.More from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.Chris Stevo: Good morning.

Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.Dr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During this morning's call, I will touch on some of our highlights from 2022, and share some thoughts regarding Pfizer's exciting near and long-term growth plans. 2022 was an outstanding year for Pfizer on multiple fronts. We exceeded $100 billion in revenues for the first time in our 174-year history. We maintained our industry-leading clinical success rates and further improved our cycle times, which already were among the industry's best. We were named to 10 different best employer lists, including those published by Forbes, LinkedIn, Glassdoor and others. And most important, more than 1.3 billion patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines.Story continuesA truly humbling achievement. Our key growth drivers for the full year 2022 included: global sales of Paxlovid, strong growth for Comirnaty in developed markets, the launch of Prevnar 20 for the adult population in the U.S., the continued strong growth of Eliquis globally, the strength of our Vyndaqel family globally, and the addition of newly acquired products Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta. Looking ahead, we foresee strong operational revenue growth of 7% to 9% in 2023, excluding revenues from our COVID-19 products and the impact of foreign exchange. We expect our potential new launches, newly acquired products and inline products will all contribute to this growth. These projections include our forecasts for several important potential product launches, including our RSV vaccine for older adults, potential Prevnar 20 pediatric indication, and products and candidates that came to us through recent business development activities, including etrasimod for ulcerative colitis, Nurtec and zavegepant for migraine, and Oxbryta for sickle cell disease.We're in the midst of an 18-month period during which we expect to have up to an unprecedented 19 new products or indications in the market. 15 of these 19 are from our internal pipeline, with the remaining 4 coming to Pfizer, as just explained, via the recent business development deals. Recognizing the importance of these potential launches, as well as those expected in 2024, to both Pfizer and the patients who rely on our innovations, we are increasing the support we are putting behind them by investing an incremental $1.3 billion in SI&amp;A expenses in 2023. Dave will provide more details on these investments during the presentation. One example of a product that is already benefitting from this additional support is Cibinqo, which recently has seen an improving growth trajectory that we expect to continue through the course of 2023.In the fourth quarter of 2022, Cibinqo's new-to-brand prescriptions grew 84% sequentially, the fastest growth rate in the class. We have started 2023 with 55% commercial formulary access, and we expect that access to continue to improve during the year, especially with the upcoming expected expansion of the U.S. indication to include adolescents, 12 to 18 year-olds, if approved. We also introduced a new direct-to-consumer campaign in November, which has increased patient awareness of Cibinqo and led to more patients asking their doctors about it. We look forward to the expected U.S. launches of etrasimod in ulcerative colitis and ritlecitinib in alopecia areata, if approved, as well as the expected launch of Abrilada, our biosimilar to Humira, to further expand our franchise in immunology this year.However, we recognize that investors are not only interested to hear this year's guidance, but also to understand the long-term growth prospects of the Company. Particular questions are focused on our plans to offset the expected $17 billion impact of the LOEs between 2025 and 2030, and our long-term projections for our COVID-19 products. We will try to address both, starting with this slide regarding our business, excluding COVID. As you can see in this chart, we expect the 15 of the 19 potential launches that are coming from our internal pipeline to generate 2030 revenues that will more than offset the expected LOE losses forecast for 2025 to 2030. The potential $20 billion in this chart is a risk-adjusted number. I would also point out that some of the potential launches are expected to be bigger contributors to our growth than others.And if all 15 were to achieve their full potential, this figure could go even higher. In addition, we believe we have the ability, if successful, to add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues to our 2030 topline expectations through business-development activity. As we have said previously, we believe the deals we have already done for Arena, Biohaven, Global Blood Therapeutics and ReViral have the potential to get us more than 40% of the way there with approximately $10.5 billion in expected 2030 revenues. I am very pleased to see that the analysts' consensus expectations for the same revenues have already reached $9.5 billion, closing materially the gap that previously existed between internal and external expectations. Four of these products have already launched or are expected to launch, subject to regulatory approval, in 2023.We also have more than enough capital to invest in the additional opportunities needed to meet or exceed this target. And, of course, we have many more potential vaccines and medicines in our pipeline, with numerous launches expected in the 2024 to 2030 timeframe, if successful in clinical trials and approved. Some of the most promising assets include: our oral GLP-1 candidate for diabetes and obesity, all of them are under this dotted box, XB; potential combo vaccines for flu, COVID-19 and RSV; our potential vaccines for Lyme disease and shingles; multiple new oncology product candidates, including ARV-471 and our CDK4 inhibitor for endocrine receptor-positive breast cancer; our gene therapy candidates for hemophilia A, hemophilia B and Duchenne muscular dystrophy; our pan-hemophilia A&amp;B antibody treatment; and many more.If approved, we expect each of these to be key incremental contributors to our growth aspirations through 2025 and beyond. Even without any of these additional potential products, we expect our 2025 to 2030 revenue CAGR to be approximately 6%. And if some of them are successful, the CAGR could exceed 10%. Now, let me turn my attention to our COVID-19 portfolio. At the JP Morgan Conference earlier this month, I spoke about expecting 2023 to be a transition year, representing a low point in our COVID-related revenues. Let me provide a little bit more color on that. I will start with Comirnaty in the U.S. as an example. In 2022, 31% of the population, or 104 million Americans, received on average 1.4 doses of COVID-19 vaccines for a total of 144 million doses.Comirnaty's share was 64%, or 92 of these 144 million doses, as you can see in the first column. In 2023, we expect about 24% of the population, or 79 million people, to receive vaccine doses for COVID during this year. This drop is due to expected fewer primary vaccinations and reduced compliance with recommendations. We expect they will receive about 1.3 doses per person on average in 2023. The drop is because fewer people are expected to receive their primary doses and, for the most part, only those who are older or at higher risk are expected to continue receiving more than one booster per year. This should result in about 102 million total vaccine doses administered in 2023. We believe Pfizer will maintain at least its 64% market share and therefore expect about 65 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to be administered in 2023.In 2024, we expect the utilization rates and market share figures to stabilize and come in roughly the same as in 2023. Then starting in 2025, and continuing in 2026 and beyond, we expect to see an increase in COVID-19 vaccination rates, assuming the successful development and approval of a COVID/flu combination product. A successful introduction of a COVID/flu combo could over time bring the percentage of Americans receiving the COVID-19 vaccine closer to the portion of people getting flu shots, which is currently about 50%. Outside the U.S., we expect these general trends to be similar with some variations from country to country. So, what does this mean for revenues? We expect 2023 to be a transition year in the U.S. In 2022, we sold at pandemic prices more doses than were eventually used.This resulted in a government inventory build that we expect to be absorbed some time in 2023, probably the second half. Around that time, we expect to start selling Comirnaty through commercial channels at commercial prices. We expect that in years 2024 and beyond, the doses sold and doses used in a year will more closely align together and the commercial price to remain relatively stable with only inflation-like price increases. Now, let me briefly urn through Paxlovid. In 2022, we estimate that 110 million COVID-19 symptomatic infections were reported in the world, excluding China. Approximately 12% of them were treated with approximately 14 million oral therapy courses and Paxlovid had the lion's share of them with approximately 90% market share.Average was 86%, but in the second half of the year exceeded the 90%. Keep in mind that this reflects a full year of reported infections, but only a partial year of Paxlovid availability due to supply constraints in the first quarter of 2022. In 2023 and beyond, we expect infections to increase slightly at 2% annually, due to waning immune protection of the population resulting from reduced vaccination rates. Similarly, we expect treatment rates to increase as awareness, education and additional oral entries will grow the oral antiviral market. Finally, we expect Paxlovid to maintain very high share despite additional competitive entries, given its strong benefit-risk profile and brand recognition. So, what does this mean for revenue? As with Comirnaty, we expect 2023 to be a transition year for Paxlovid as well.In 2022, we sold at Pandemic prices more treatment courses than were eventually used. This resulted in a government inventory build that we expect to be absorbed some time in 2023, probably second half. Around that time, we expect to start selling Paxlovid through the commercial channels at commercial prices. We expect in years 2024 and beyond that the courses sold and used will align closely together within every year. There has been a great deal of speculation regarding the new but uncertain market opportunity for Paxlovid in China, so let me share what we are seeing. We have an agreement with one company to import and distribute Paxlovid in China, local company, and we have a manufacturing agreement with another local Chinese company for local manufacturing.Pfizer shipped only tens of thousands of courses to China in fiscal year 2022. From December, which is the first month of our non-U.S. fiscal year, through March, we expect to ship millions of courses to meet local demand. We expect we will be able to sell effectively under government reimbursement through end of March. And despite China's recent decision not to include Paxlovid on the country's National Drug Reimbursement List, we expect to offer the product on the private market after April 1st unless, of course, a listing opportunity opens up before then. Lastly, I want to point out that while we are expecting increased utilization in all regions of the world as infections increase, we are not including any major new non-U.S. or non-China contracts in our 2023 forecasts.Let me close with a few thoughts regarding our scientific engine. R&amp;D continues to be the lifeblood that fuels us as a company, which is why we plan to increase our R&amp;D spend by at least 8.7% in 2023 to $12.4 billion and $13.4 billion range. In addition to the increased investments, we are taking steps not only to further improve our industry-leading success rates and cycle times, but also to increase overall return on investment and R&amp;D productivity. As you have seen in the last year, we continuously prioritize our pipeline to focus on the assets that represent potential breakthroughs and have the potential for generating higher returns, putting more capital behind larger opportunities like GLP-1, flu, elranatamab, and others. We are at an inflection point to act from a position of strength with our best-in-class R&amp;D productivity, a robust pipeline of innovative assets and one of the highest R&amp;D budgets in the industry.With that, I will turn it over to Dave to provide details on our fourth-quarter performance and our outlook for 2023. After Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&amp;D pipeline. Take it over, Dave.Vaccine, Covid19, EpidemicPhoto by Adrià Crehuet Cano on UnsplashDave Denton: Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. Albert has already taken you through many of the key drivers of our full-year performance, so I will focus my opening remarks on some key highlights from the fourth quarter. Revenues grew 13% operationally, primarily driven by Comirnaty's strong growth in developed markets following the slowdown in deliveries that we discussed in the third quarter ahead of the rollout of the bivalent booster. We also saw very strong performances from Paxlovid outside the U.S. and the ongoing launch of Prevnar 20 for adults within the U.S. Excluding direct sales and alliance revenues related to our COVID-19 products, Pfizer's revenues grew 5% operationally in the quarter, and if recently acquired products from Biohaven and GBT are also excluded, revenues were up approximately 3% in Q4.Reported diluted EPS this quarter grew by 48% to $0.87, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.14 grew 69% on an operational basis in the quarter. Both EPS figures include a $0.32 benefit from lower acquired IPR&amp;D expenses compared to last year's fourth quarter. Once again in the quarter, foreign exchange movements significantly impacted our results, reducing fourth quarter revenues by approximately $2.5 billion, or 11%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.19, or 24%, compared to LY. On a full-year basis, foreign exchange negatively impacted revenues by $5.5 billion, or 7%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.36, or 9%. Turning now to 2023 and the financial outlook for the Company. Let me first point out that our approach to guidance in 2023 is fundamentally different than prior years.Given the expected transition to commercial markets for our COVID franchise, and away from an Advanced Purchase Agreement environment, our guidance reflects our best estimates for revenues and profits for these products for the full year, not just what has been contractually secured. On a total company basis, we expect revenues of between $67 billion to $71 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 31% at the midpoint. Importantly, we expect that revenues from our business excluding COVID will grow between 7% and 9% on an operational basis in 2023. That growth is projected to be split between contributions from our new product launches, our recently acquired products, as well as our in-line portfolio. The total company revenue declines are entirely driven by our COVID products, which are expected to go from their peak in 2022 to their low point in 2023 before potentially returning to growth in 2024 and beyond.While patient demand for our COVID products is expected to remain strong throughout 2023, much of that demand is expected to be fulfilled by products that were delivered to governments in 2022 and recorded as revenues last year. I want to point out that our total company revenue guidance range is wider than what is implied by the 7% to 9% operational growth rate range for the business excluding COVID. The wider guidance range reflects the potential volatility that we see in our COVID product revenues, given that they can be significantly impacted by factors outside of our control, such as the infection rates and the severity of the virus, as well as the timing for transitioning to a traditional commercial model here in the U.S. Now, you can see on this slide our cost and expense guidance for 2023.As I mentioned in my remarks at our investor event in December, both SI&amp;A and R&amp;D expenses are expected to be significantly higher in 2023 versus 2022, despite the fact that our overall revenues are coming down. Higher investments in SI&amp;A are significantly focused on the successful launches of the large number of potential new products that Albert highlighted, as well as recently acquired assets. Additionally, the expected commercial launch of both Comirnaty and Paxlovid in the U.S. will require additional investments as we transition away from the government market. These investments are squarely focused on supporting the Company's 2025 to 2030 growth aspirations. We also intend to invest significantly into our research efforts this year, with multiple exciting and potentially high-value programs receiving additional funding, including our oral GLP-1 programs, elranatamab, and respiratory combination vaccines.All of this spending to support our commercial and research activities, we believe, will not only yield an attractive return, but will also contribute toward setting us on a path to achieve our long-term growth goals. I'll point out that when you exclude revenues and expenses related to COVID products, our expected operating margin profile this year is largely consistent with the prior year. This reflects incremental investments in SI&amp;A related to launch products and R&amp;D, as well as lower acquired IPR&amp;D. In 2023, we are investing in both R&amp;D and SI&amp;A in advance of revenue contributions from new products. Looking longer-term, we expect this spending will be maintained, with the P&amp;L growing into this cost base as new product revenues begin to be fully realized, with margins improving as a result.Given that 2023 is both a year of investment and transition, I thought it would be helpful to outline many of our key assumptions built into our guidance. I don't intend to walk you through all the elements here, but both slides 19 and 20 outline many of the details. In summary, these assumptions include: strong revenue growth of 7 to 9% in our business excluding COVID products; additional investments in SI&amp;A and R&amp;D to support Pfizer's near- and longer-term growth plans; continued patient demand for our COVID-related products worldwide, with vaccination rates declining slightly and utilization of treatments slightly increasing; rephasing of the European Commission Comirnaty contract over multiple years versus full delivery in 2023; and, finally, U.S. commercialization of the COVID products in the second half of 2023.In summary, as we enter a new year, our business is extremely strong, with many in-line, acquired and expected launch products capable of driving strong growth with an attractive pipeline of potential products coming in the future. We believe 2023 will be an important year for Pfizer, and that is why we are deploying our resources into quality execution in order to fully realize the growth opportunities we see within our portfolio and pipeline, which have the potential to impact our growth outlook through 2030 and beyond. So, with that, let me turn it over to Mikael.Dr. Mikael Dolsten: Thank you, Dave. Today, I want to set the stage for an anticipated catalyst-rich 18 months. As Albert mentioned, we are in a position of unprecedented strength in our history and I'm excited to share a high-level overview of an evolved strategy for Pfizer R&amp;D to focus our resources on transformative programs which could be most impactful for patients, drive improved return on R&amp;D investment and create the most value. We will leverage and continue to innovate our powerhouse capabilities in medicine design, and continue to innovate light-speed drug development to further improve our industry-leading success rates and cycle times. We have rethought our approach to rare disease and will move from having a standalone research unit to aligning key programs with other therapeutic areas.We plan to externally advance rare disease programs that do not fit into a core therapeutic area of focus. At the same time, we plan to tap into the expanding external innovation ecosystem by actively pursuing biotech innovation and emerging innovation that fits strategically and accessing external assets that are differentiated. Taken together we believe these actions will help position us to lead the industry in reaching more patients with the most impactful near-term blockbuster breakthroughs while driving forward the next wave of innovations. I'm pleased to share some examples with you today. We are pursuing potentially transformative efficacy in our inflammation &amp; immunology franchise, with the potential launches of etrasimod in ulcerative colitis and ritlecitinib in alopecia areata, which both have the potential to be blockbusters, and a planned Phase 3 study start of anti-interferon Beta in dermatomyositis and other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.Our next wave of innovation includes two monoclonal antibody candidates for atopic dermatitis which exemplify our multispecific platform and in-house biomedicine design expertise. Two assets currently in Phase 1 clinical trials each target three cytokines in a single therapeutic, so we refer to them as trispecifics. On the right are Phase 1 pharmacokinetic profiles of the average plasma concentration. For both molecules, the profiles suggest that once-a-month, or even less frequent, subcutaneous dosing may be supported. There is potential for improved efficacy with more potent interleukin 4 and interleukin 13 neutralization plus an expanded breadth of efficacy by blocking Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin to potentially cover more endotypes, or by blocking interleukin 33 (sic) to potentially enhance itch reduction.The Phase 1 studies continue. We aim to bolster our 30-year experience in hematology with a strong pipeline that complements our in-line portfolio and collectively has blockbuster potential. I will talk more about elranatamab and GBT-601 in a moment, so will highlight here that we expect multiple data readouts for TTI-622 in hematological malignancies, two Phase 3 readouts for inclacumab in sickle cell disease in the second half of 2024 and a Phase 3 readout for marstacimab in patients with hemophilia A or B in the second quarter of 2023. Marstacimab has FDA Fast Track designation for both, hemophilia A and B with inhibitors. If successful, we project submitting for the non-inhibitor indication in both A and B hemophilia in the third quarter of 2023.We recently announced positive top-line results from a Phase 3 study of our hemophilia B gene therapy candidate and expect a pivotal readout for our hemophilia A gene therapy in the first half of 2024. We recently presented strong updated Phase 2 data on elranatamab, our investigational B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, CD3-targeted bispecific antibody, for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in heavily pre-treated patients who had received at least three classes of prior therapies. This candidate, which has the potential to be a leader in the BCMA bi-specific class, demonstrated a high objective response rate of 61% in patients with no prior BCMA-targeted treatment, early and deep responses, and a manageable safety profile. Given factors currently limiting the availability of novel therapies in the triple-class exposed setting, elranatamab has the potential to reach a broader and greater number of patients as an off-the-shelf option with reduced dosing frequency that is administered subcutaneously, offering more convenience than intravenous administration.With FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation granted last year, elranatamab could potentially be approved this year. As there is blockbuster potential and patient value beyond the triple-class refractory population, our clinical strategy aims to move to earlier lines of therapy and combination approaches with the potential, if successful, for multiple approvals to expand eligibility and duration of therapy. Now, to our next generation oral, once-daily, hemoglobin S polymerization inhibitor candidate that's in a unique class and has the potential to expand the prophylactic treatment of people with sickle cell disease. Standard-of-care treatment rates have typically been low due to side effects, poor efficacy, or both. While Oxbryta made substantial progress in preventing hemoglobin polymerization, or sickling, GBT-601 is a potentially best-in-class candidate which may improve both hemolysis and frequency of vaso-occlusive crises.The most recent data from our Phase 1 multiple ascending dose study showed improvements in hematocrit and hemoglobin levels over time, mean hemoglobin occupancy of more than 32% for the 100 milligram maintenance dose and more than 41% for the 150 milligram maintenance dose, and improvements in red blood cell health with the higher maintenance doses. The maintenance doses were well tolerated. We believe these results may be transformative for patients, with a potential to achieve 35% to 45% hemoglobin occupancy, which is considered optimal for both hemoglobin oxygen affinity and preventing sickling, and approaches levels seen with gene therapies. This asset is also being studied in an ongoing Phase 2 study with a seamless Phase 2/3 design. We plan to start the Phase 3 part in the second half of 2023.Next, we aim to expand our leadership in breast cancer with a pipeline of complementary next-wave candidates. Our CDK4 inhibitor targets improving on CDK4/6 inhibition standard of care by maximizing CDK4 coverage. We are studying it in Phase 1 in hormone receptor positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer as a single agent and in combination with endocrine therapy. The majority of hormone receptor positive breast cancers express low CDK6, while CDK4 is likely to be a major cell cycle driver. We have seen that CDK4/6 inhibition can lead to neutropenia that requires more frequent blood test monitoring, mostly driven by CDK6 inhibition, and that complete CDK4 inhibition by CDK4/6 inhibitors is challenging due to dose-limiting hematological adverse events.In the Phase 1 combination study, the confirmed objective response rate in combination with fulvestrant or letrozole reached nearly 30% and the clinical benefit rate was approximately 50% in 21 patients with measurable disease. The median progression-free survival was more than 24 weeks in 26 patients including 5 without measurable disease. All participants were heavily pre-treated with a median of four lines of prior treatment. All patients received prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment and 67% received prior fulvestrant. The asset was well tolerated with CDK4 drug showing only 15% Grade 3 neutropenia and no Grade 4. Here, we show a scan of a patient who achieved partial response and was on treatment for 47 weeks. She had received six lines of prior treatment, including CDK4/6 inhibition and fulvestrant.We are currently engaged in dose optimization, enrolling CDK4/6-naÃ¯ve cohorts, and planning to start a randomized study in second-line treatment of estrogen receptor positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer this year. Additional data readouts from our next wave of breast cancer candidates are anticipated in the first half of 2023. In addition to the assets I spoke about today, we anticipate multiple milestones over the next 18 months. We expect a pivotal IBRANCE readout in hormone receptor positive/HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, a pivotal study start for ARV-471 and a Phase 2 readout for our KAT6 inhibitor. We have achieved incredible advancement in our vaccines portfolio, including candidates that harness our leadership in mRNA, with an unprecedented number of milestones expected.In addition to the expected launches shown here, we expect a Phase 3 data readout from our modRNA flu candidate vaccine, and a potential respiratory combination vaccine study start. A Phase 1/2 study of our shingles candidate, the first mRNA-based shingles vaccine program, began last week. In inflammation &amp; immunology as well as internal medicine, key catalysts include potential launches of potential blockbusters, a planned pivotal study start with anti-interferon Beta and data readouts in metabolic disease. We're also making good progress in our anti-infectives portfolio, including anticipating full approval for Paxlovid, and planned study starts for both our second-generation COVID-19 antiviral candidate, which may have no or limited drug-drug interactions, and our RSV antiviral candidate.In closing, we are very optimistic about the many transformative catalysts emerging from the pipeline. Pfizer scientists are working with urgency and commitment to help the most patients as quickly as we can. Thank you.

According to a Bloomberg report, Noelle Acheson of “Crypto Is Macro Now” newsletter said that FOMO is expected to “play a role in how the market evolves from here.” The Bloomberg report also quoted  researcher Kaiko who said on Twitter that average size of trades indicate that “whales” are driving the rally.Story continuesBitcoin and crypto ETFs also had a remarkable month in January.

Our confidence in Jensen remains, and while gaming is no longer in hyper-growth mode, the Data Center segment continues to grow.

A collection of vintage cars? Maybe even a private jet complete with a personal pilot to take you anywhere in the world?In the case of Bryan Johnson, it's trying to eke out his time on earth to the max.While Silicon Valley tech billionaires, like Oracle’s founder Larry Ellison, Google co-founder Larry Page, and Jeff Bezos have long been funneling millions into the field of longevity research, Johnson is taking his quest to live as long as humanely possible a step further.The 45-year-old American tech entrepreneur spends around $2 million a year to have the skin of a 28-year-old and the lung capacity of an 18-year-old.And despite making headlines for the extreme lengths he’s taking to fight aging, there’s one thing interesting many people who have only recently heard of the youth-chasing millionaire: How did he get rich enough to afford all these treatments in the first place?Courtesy of Project BlueprintBryan Johnson had an early taste for entrepreneurialismToday, the Braintree and Kernel founder’s net worth is estimated to be around $400 million. But Johnson wasn’t born into extreme wealth.Born in a small religious town in Utah, Johnson lived with his mother and stepfather, who owned a trucking company.Before getting a taste for entrepreneurialism, he became a Mormon missionary and spent two years in Ecuador at 19.Following this stint, he went to college and graduated with a BA in International Studies from Brigham Young University in 2003. It was during that time, that he launched his first three startups.His first venture involved selling phones. He even enlisted other college students to sell service plans along with cell phones and earned around $300 commission on each sale.Although the business failed to gain success, it helped pay his way through his studies.He also founded a voice communications company similar to Skype called Inquist, which shut shop in 2001.Story continuesFollowing that, he joined a real estate project with his brother, which also failed.45-year-old CEO Bryan Johnson is spending millions to reverse aging and look like an 18-year-old again. Courtesy of Dustin Giallanza/Project BlueprintBraintree: Johnson’s big breakFinally, Johnson got his big break when he founded the mobile payment platform Braintree in 2007.In just three years it had grown by over 4,000% and was boasting $4.6 million in revenue, earning it a spot on Inc. magazine's list of the 500 fastest-growing companies for two years running.The company ranked 47th in 2011 and 415th in 2012. That year, the company acquired Venmo for $26.2 million.By September 2013, the business which was processing $12 billion in payments annually, was bought by Paypal for $800 million.Johnson used $200 million from the acquisition to create the biotech venture firm OS Fund in 2014 and then later, the neurotechnology company Kernel.The OS Fund says it’s seeking founders who see beyond our lifetimes and has raised funding for 28 portfolio companies which range from designing protein that doesn’t exist in nature to kits that can detect diseases in your DNA.Nearly all of the investments have received follow-on funding, three have been valued at over $1 billion and at least, two have been acquired.Johnson’s Kernel launched in 2016. In just a year, it had already grown to a team of 30.It has since designed headwear to measure brain signals with the aim of testing conditions like Alzheimer’s and by 2020, it had already raised around $53 million from outside investors.Not one to slow down, Johnson published two children's books between 2017 and 2019. On top of his investments and startups, the sales of Code 7: Cracking the Code for an Epic Life and The Proto Project: A Sci-Fi Adventure of the Mind, will be adding to his already sizable fortune.His most recent venture is what made the recent round of headlines: Johnson launched Blueprint in 2021 with the aim to measure (and reverse) the aging process of 70 of his own organs and share his learnings with the world.He recently claimed to have reversed his epigenetic age by 5.1 years. However, we are yet to find out just how lucrative chasing youth will be for Johnson.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Olympic legend Usain Bolt lost $12 million in savings to a scam.

For more companies, head on over to Top 5 Smartest Companies To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Surviving in the modern day corporate world is not for the faint of heart. Business is a ruthless endeavor, and shareholder and investor interest reign supreme for each company. The companies that have survived, and have turned into modern day giants and/or disrupted industries are ones that have beaten the competition by introducing unique products and services and capturing consumer attention through marketing campaigns. America, which has the largest and most developed corporate sector in the world (even the universe maybe, unless NASA finds aliens), is full of companies that disrupted industries and become corporate giants — even closing in on the African continent's GDP when it comes to market capitalization. Africa's nominal GDP is slated to be $3.14 trillion by 2023 according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), while the two most valuable American firms — Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) — have a combined market capitalization of $4.16 trillion.Both have led the charge and transformed entire industries. For Apple, its biggest strength is the manufacturing supply chain that enables it to pump out millions of iPhones each year. For Microsoft,  it has been the ability to target the highest growing industries and become a dominant player in them. The best example of this is the Azure cloud computing and data center platform, which grew 40% on a YoY basis in the second quarter of 2022.Marcin Balcerzak/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has taken a wager at trying to identify the smartest companies in the world.

Virent, a Marathon Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:MPC) subsidiary, used its BioForming® process to produce the synthesized aromatic kerosene (SAK), a critical component that made the 100% SAF possible.Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Wednesday, February 1, 2023, Press release picture""Virent's technology converts widely available, plant-based sugars into the compounds that make it possible to fuel a jet engine without the need to blend SAF with traditional jet fuel,"" said Dave Kettner, President and General Counsel of Virent, Inc. ""Along with Marathon Petroleum Corporation, we are committed to meeting today's energy needs while investing in an energy diverse future, and today's flight is a great example of this commitment. We're excited about this opportunity to work with our forward-thinking colleagues at Emirates, GE Aerospace, Boeing, Honeywell and Neste as we demonstrate that we can power sustainable aviation without modifying today's engines or the infrastructure that serves the airline industry.""Today's SAF - typically made from used cooking oil or other plant-based oil feedstocks - has to be blended with petroleum products because SAF lacks a component called ""aromatics,"" which is required to meet today's jet fuel specifications. Virent's SAK, made from renewable plant sugars, provides those aromatics..Because Virent's SAK is made from plant-based sugars as feedstocks, the carbon impact on a lifecycle basis is less than that of petroleum-based fuels. Virent is targeting greater than 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for SAK from a commercial project, with the potential to achieve net zero emissions using options such as renewable electricity, renewable natural gas and carbon capture and sequestration in the production of SAK. Virent has also developed data from engine testing that shows an SAF blend using its SAK is cleaner burning and has lower particulate matter emissions than conventional jet fuels.Story continues""We share Emirates Airline's goals of minimizing greenhouse gas emissions and scaling up the supply chain for SAF,"" said Kettner. ""Because SAF is a relatively new fuel technology, it's critical that we collaborate on flights like this to bring SAF into more widespread use.""This latest use of Virent's technology to help power jet engines with 100% SAF comes after successful demonstration flights with United Airlines in December 2021 and Gulfstream in December 2022.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Marathon Petroleum Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Marathon Petroleum CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/marathon-petroleum-corporation Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Marathon Petroleum CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/737785/Virent-Bio-Based-Fuel-Used-in-Third-Milestone-Demonstration-Flight-Powered-With-100-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel]"

My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. References to MPC's capital spending during the prepared remarks today reflects standalone MPC Capital excluding MPLX. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.Mike Hennigan: Thanks Kristina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. First off, I want to recognize a new director on the MPC board. Toni Townes-Whitley will be joining our board in March, bringing tremendous experience with her most recent executive position at Microsoft, as well as her board experience on the NASDAQ and PNC boards. Also like to recognize Christine Breves, who was appointed as a new independent director of MPLX in November, and recently served as CFO for US Steel. As we look back at 2022, we've delivered on our strategic commitments. Full year cash provided by operating activities was just over $16 billion on a consolidated basis, and over $13 billion, excluding MPLX, reflecting our improving operating and commercial execution.Our commitment to safe and reliable operations resulted in refining utilization of 96%. And our team's dynamic responses to volatile product markets delivered strong commercial performance, resulting in a 98% full year capture. Our focus on fostering a low-cost culture enable us to sustain our previously achieved $1.5 billion of structural cost reduction throughout the year. We formed a strategic partnership with Neste, which will enhance the economics of our Martinez Renewables fuels project and create a platform for additional collaboration within renewables. In Midstream, our business grew 7% year-over-year, MPLX raise its distribution by 10%. And based on this level, we expect MPC will receive $2 billion of annual distributions. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio.Story continuesAnd as MPLX grows its free cash flow, we believe we will continue to have the capacity to increase its capital return to unit holders. In 2022, we return nearly $12 billion through share repurchases, bringing the total repurchases to almost $17 billion since May of 2021. In addition, we increased MPC's dividend 30% to $0.75 per quarter. Executing on our operating, commercial and financial objectives, combined with a strong macroenvironment led to total shareholder returns of 87% for MPC in 2022. Before Maryann goes through the results for the quarter, we wanted to share our outlook on the macroenvironment and the financial priorities for 2023. Our outlook remains bullish for 23 supported by the nearly 4 million barrels per day of refining capacity that has come offline globally in the last couple of years.Demand for transportation fuels we manufacture remains robust. We've seen recovery in demand across all our products since coming out of the pandemic. And we anticipate further recovery in 2023, particularly as we expect consumers to adjust consumption patterns to lower retail fuel prices. Uncertainties remain around the pace and impact of China's recovery, the magnitude of a potential US or global recession and the impact of Russian product sanctions. But despite these unknowns, we believe that the current supply constraints and growing demand will support strong refining margins in 23. Our financial priorities remain unchanged. These includes first sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operating our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees, and support the communities in which we operate.Second, our dividend, we are committed to the dividend which we increased 30% at the end of last year, and intend to evaluate at least annually. And as we repurchase shares, the reduction in the share count increases the ability to support future dividend growth. Third, growth capital. We believe this is a return on and return of capital business. We've been through a progressive change over the last few years and remain focused on ensuring the competitiveness of our assets as we progress through the energy evolution. We will invest capital where we believe there are attractive returns. In traditional refining, we're focused on investments that enhance the competitiveness of our assets. In the low carbon area, investment at this time is primarily associated with the completion of the Martinez Renewables project, as well as a project at our LA refinery that will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions.In addition, we're focused on growth opportunities in emerging technologies, as well as opportunities enabled by digital transformation. Beyond these three objectives, we're also returning s excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. In the period from early November through the end of January, we've completed nearly $2.4 billion of share repurchases. And today, we announced an incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization, reinforcing our commitment to strong capital returns. Our goal is to be the investment of choice in the refining space, generating the most through cycle cash flow, creating value through strategic deployment of capital and delivering superior returns to our shareholders. We also challenged ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by setting meaningful targets to reduce GHG emissions, methane emissions and freshwater intensity targets which we believe we can demonstrate a tangible path to accomplish.As we innovate for the future, Phase 1 of our Martinez Renewables fuel facilities progressing startup activities, marking a significant milestone in our sustainable energy goals. The facility is on track to reach full Phase 1 production capacity of 260 million gallons per year of renewable fuels by the end of the first quarter 2023. Pretreatment capabilities are expected to come online in the second half of 23, which will enable the facility to ramp up to its full expected capacity of 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. At Dickinson, we've optimized operations to be able to bringing in more advantage feedstocks, lowering the carbon intensity of the fuels we produce. We've enhanced our position in the renewables value chain through our pretreatment facilities in Beatrice and Cincinnati.We'll continue to look for opportunities leveraging the strategic partnerships we're cultivating with Neste and ADM. As evidence of our progress on our sustainability goals, this year, MTC was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America for the fourth consecutive year. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.azerbaijan, baku, business, crane, dawn, derricks, drilling, energy, engineering, equipment, evening, exploration, fuel, gas, gasoline, industrial, industry, installation, land, machinery, offshore, oil, petrol, petroleum, platform, power, production, pumps, rig, sea, shallow, ship, silhouette, sky, technology, tool, tug, vessel, water, wellCopyright: Elnur / 123RF Stock PhotoMaryann Mannen: Thanks, Mike. Moving the fourth quarter results. Slide 6 provides the summary of our financial results, this morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.65. This excludes a $176 million LIFO inventory benefit, as well as $60 million gain related to the Speedway transactions. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.8 billion for the quarter, and cash flow from operations, excluding unfavorable working capital changes, was $4.4 billion. During the quarter, we returned $351 million to shareholders through dividend payments, and repurchased over $1.8 billion of our shares. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2022.Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $1 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by refining and marketing, as the blended crack spread was down over $5 per barrel, reflecting a 20% quarterly decline. Corporate expenses were higher in the fourth quarter driven by a retroactive operating tax assessments for prior periods. We intend to pursue recovery of these multiyear tax assessments. In addition, corporate includes special compensation expenses, which also affected our refining and marketing and midstream segments. We do not anticipate that these costs will structurally impact future corporate cost. The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of nearly $1 billion and the full year tax rate was 22%.Moving to our segment results, slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining and Marketing segments. Like many in the industry, several of our refineries were impacted by winter storm Elliott at the end of December, primarily in our Gulf Coast in Mid-Con regions. Most of our assets were back online after a short period, and we have not seen structural issues. The crude throughput impact was approximately 4 million barrels, which reduced our crude capacity utilization for the fourth quarter by roughly 2%. Looking to January, we anticipate impacts to throughput of 3.5 million barrels which is reflected in our guidance for the first quarter of 2023. Even with a disruption at the end of the quarter, our refining assets ran at 94% utilization, processing 2.7 million barrels of crude per day at our 13 refineries.Sequentially we saw per barrel margins decline most notably in the West Coast region, while US Gulf Coast margins were relatively flat, supported by export demand. Capture was 109% reflecting a strong result from our commercial team. Operating expenses were lower in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower energy cost partially offset by a special compensation expense of approximately $0.15 per barrel, paid in recognition for our employees contributions. Due to lower throughputs in the quarter refining operating costs per barrel were roughly flat in the fourth quarter at $5.62 per barrel as compared to the third quarter. Our full year refining operating costs per barrel is $5.41 when we compare to 2021 refining operating costs per barrel of $5.02, this increase can be entirely attributed to higher energy costs.We believe the actions we have taken to reduce our structural operating costs are sustainable. Slide 9 provides an overview of our refining and marketing capture this quarter, which was 109%. Our commercial teams executed effectively in a volatile market, light product margin tailwinds improved secondary product prices and favorable inventory impacts all benefited capture. We do not expect all of these tailwinds to be repeatable. And in particular, we would expect the inventory impacts to reverse in the first quarter. As our strategic pillar indicates we have been committed to improving our commercial performance and we believe that the capabilities we have built over the last 18 months will provide a sustainable advantage. Historically, we communicated a captured target of 95%.But over the last few years, the baseline has moved through our commercial efforts closer to 100%. We believe we have built capabilities that will provide incremental value beyond what we have realized to date, and will produce results that can be seen in our financials. Slide 10 show the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2022. Our Midstream segment delivered resilient fourth quarter results. We did see lower EBITDA, primarily due to impacts associated with lower NGL prices. This quarter MPLX distributions contributed $502 million in cash flow to MPC. Slide 11 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital was $4.4 billion in the quarter.Working Capital was a $72 million headwind for the quarter, driven mostly by declining crude prices offset by benefits from inventory impacts. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $1.3 billion this quarter. We saw consistent spending in refining in the fourth quarter as work progress on the Martinez Renewables fuel facility conversion and the STAR project at Galveston Bay. While not reflected in the 2022 capital spend, due to the timing of the JV close, the 50% reimbursement from Neste for Martinez capital spend, was received and reflected in overall cash flows in the third quarter. MPC returned nearly $2.2 billion via share repurchase and dividends during the quarter. We began using the incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization in November.For the full year, we returned $13.2 billion out of $17.7 billion of our 2022 cash from operations, excluding working capital impacts, representing a 75% payout. This was partially enabled by our commitment to complete our $15 billion capital return program. The outstanding purchase authorization of $7.6 billion, which includes the incremental $5 billion approval demonstrates our commitment to returning capital. At the end of the fourth quarter, MPC had approximately $11.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. Slide 12 provides their capital investment plan for 2023, which reflects our continuing focus on strict capital discipline. MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals approximately $1.3 billion. The plan includes $1.25 billion for the refining and marketing segment, of which approximately $350 million or roughly 30% is related to maintenance and regulatory compliance.Our growth capital plan is approximately $900 million split between low carbon and traditional projects. Within low carbon $150 million is allocated for completion of the Martinez conversion. We are also executing a project at our Los Angeles refinery, which will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions. This is a multiyear project. In 2023, we expect associated capital spending to be $150 million. And we have allocated $50 million to smaller projects focused on emerging opportunities. Within traditional refining, $150 million is associated with the completion of the STAR project. $200 million is focused on smaller projects targeted at enhancing the yields of our refineries, improving energy efficiency, and lowering our cost. In marketing, we plan to spend $150 million for projects that focus on enhancing and expanding the platform for our Marathon and ARCO brands.This morning MPLX also announced their 2023 capital investment plan of $950 million. Their plan includes approximately $800 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital. The capital spending plan focuses on adding new gas processing plants and smaller investments targeted at expansion and debottlenecking. of existing assets to meet customer demand. Turning to guidance, slide 13, we provide our first quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.5 million barrels per day, representing 88% utilization. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than fourth quarter levels due to turn around impacts in our US Gulf Coast region, plan turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $350 million in the first quarter, with a significant level of activity in the Gulf Coast region.The remaining scope of the STAR project, specifically 40,000 barrels per day of crude and 17,000 barrels per day of resid processing capacity is expected to be tied in during the turnaround at Galveston Bay in the first quarter, and should begin to ramp starting in the second quarter of 2023. We expect the level of 2023 turnaround spending to be similar to the level of spend in 2022. However, unlike 2022, we expect turnaround activity to be front half weighted this year, with significant planned work in the first and second quarters. Therefore, we will have executed four consecutive quarters of heavy turnaround work. Operating costs per barrel in the first quarter are expected to be flat at $5.60 per barrel for the quarter. In conjunction with our turnarounds, we anticipate higher project related expenses as we utilize our planned downtime to complete other work plans.We are seeing the benefits from lower energy costs in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions. But given the majority of our turnaround activity is heavily weighted to the Gulf Coast. Our expectations of flat operating costs quarter-to- quarter is driven by our West Coast exposure, where we have not seen a decline in energy costs recently. As we look into 2023, we anticipate our operating costs per barrel would decline and trend towards a more normalized level as we complete this turnaround and project activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. With that, let me pass it back to Mike.Mike Hennigan: Thanks Maryann. In summary, we believe solid execution of our three strategic pillars remains foundational. Similar to what we've achieved with cost reductions and portfolio. We believe the improvements we've made to our commercial and operational execution have driven structural sustainable benefits, which will enable us to capture opportunities, irrespective of the market environment. Our goal is to position MPC as the refiner investment of choice, generating the most cash through cycle and delivering superior returns to our shareholders with our steadfast commitment to returning capital. Let me turn the call back to Kristina.Kristina Kazarian: Thanks Mike. And with that, Sheila, we're ready for questions.See also 15 Largest Australian Companies by Revenue and 12 Cash Rich Dividend Stocks To Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Operating income of the segment totaled $3.9 billion, ahead of its Zacks Consensus Estimate by 38%.Marathon Petroleum reported revenues of $40.1 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32 billion and improved 12.6% year over year.In October 2022, the company completed its target of buying back $15 billion in common stock. This was after Marathon Petroleum concluded the sale of its Speedway business, comprising approximately 3,900 c-stores in 35 states to Japan-based retail group Seven &amp;i Holdings — the owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain — for $21 billion.In the fourth quarter, MPC repurchased $1.8 billion of shares and a further $700 million worth of shares this year till Jan 27. The company, which gave an additional $5 billion share repurchase approval, currently has a remaining authorization of $7.6 billion.Marathon Petroleum plans to spend $1.3 billion in capital expenditure this year. Of this, some $360 million is earmarked for low-carbon opportunities.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Marathon Petroleum Corporation Quote Inside MPC’s SegmentsRefining &amp; Marketing: The Refining &amp; Marketing segment reported an operating income of $3.9 billion, which soared from the year-ago profit of just $881 million. The jump primarily reflects higher year-over-year margins that more than offset lower throughputs and refined product sales.Specifically, the refining margin of $28.82 per barrel improved significantly from $15.88 a year ago. Capacity utilization during the quarter was 94% — same as last year. However, total refined product sales volumes were 3,532 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), down from 3,600 mbpd in the year-ago quarter. Throughput also fell from 2,936 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to 2,895 mbpd and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2,926 mbpd.Further, operating costs per barrel increased 4.9% year over year to $4.62. The cost escalation was blamed on higher energy-related outgo, more turnaround activity, as well as a special compensation expense.Midstream: This unit mainly reflects Marathon Petroleum’s general partner and majority limited partner interests in MPLX LP MPLX — a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream assets.Segment profitability was $1.1 billion, edging up 1.7% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Earnings were supported by higher tariff rates and the stable, fee-based revenues from MPLX’s wide range of midstream energy services.Story continues Costs, Capex &amp; Balance SheetMarathon Petroleum, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), reported expenses of $35.4 billion in fourth-quarter 2022, rising 4.5% from the year-ago quarter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $849 million on capital programs (59% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 35% on the Midstream segment) compared to $651 million in the year-ago period. As of Dec 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $8.6 billion and total debt, including that of MPLX, of $26.7 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 43.9%.Some Key Refining EarningsWhile we have discussed MPC’s fourth-quarter results in detail, let’s see how some other refining companies have fared this earnings season.Phillips 66 PSX reported adjusted earnings per share of $4, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.34. However, the bottom line improved significantly from a profit of $2.94 per share in the year-ago quarter.PSX’s worldwide margins improved to $19.73 per barrel from the year-ago quarter’s $11.95. The same in the Central Corridor and Atlantic Basin/Europe increased to $25.03 and $19.58 per barrel from the year-ago levels of $12.60 and $11, respectively. In the Gulf Coast, the metric registered an improvement to $16.35 per barrel from $10.16 in the prior-year quarter. The West Coast witnessed an increase in margins from $15.80 per barrel in the year-ago quarter to $16.77 in the December-end quarter of 2022.But another refining giant, Valero Energy VLO, reported strong fourth-quarter earnings. The bottom line of $8.45 per share came in well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.45. The outperformance reflects increased refinery throughput volumes and a higher refining margin. In particular, adjusted operating income in the Refining unit amounted to $4.4 billion, surging from $1.1 billion in the year-ago quarter.At the end of 2022, VLO had cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 billion, while the company’s total debt and finance lease obligations amounted to $11.4 billion.

Mazda sold around 295,000 cars in North America last year, highlighting its small brand status in a region where GM (GM) sold nearly 10 times as many cars.It’s why investing big time into fully electric vehicles has been so hard for Mazda, because of the billions of dollars needed for new platforms. It’s also why Mazda is leaning hard into its hybrid options, like it’s all new flagship SUV, the CX-90.The 2024 Mazda CX-90 SUV“So CX-90 launches with our most powerful engine ever in both gasoline mild hybrid and also plug-in hybrid forms - so the platform has only electrified powertrains,” says Mazda North America president &amp; CEO Jeff Guyton in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “It really represents a big step forward in terms of the premium-ness of the Mazda brand, and we're bringing that together with a premium experience in our new retail evolution showrooms across the country.”The CX-90 is a big three-row, premium SUV, and as Guyton mentions, will only have “electrified” powertrains. In a country like the US where EV is growing every year, the question is this: why wasn’t the CX-90 given a fully-electric powertrain?Guyton says it's because Mazda’s customers haven’t been asking for that—yet.“What we see happening right now is that customers are obviously quite interested in the journey of electrification, but there are also inhibiting factors because the customer experience for electric is, let's say, it has growing pains right now,” Guyton says. “Whether you're talking about charging, or cold weather, or hot weather, or electricity in California in the summertime, and so forth.”Story continuesMazda currently has only one EV for sale in America, the midsize MX-30 EV which has a paltry 100 mile range, and is only sold in limited quantities in California. Mazda says a hybrid range-extending version of this car is coming out later this year, with the company’s first true EVs slated for 2025-2027 timeframe.It’s all part of the company’s $10.6 billion investment into EV’s, which does sound like a decent sum of money, but pales in comparison with what giants like GM, Ford (F), and Volkswagen (Vow3.DE) are spending.Mazda Vision Study Model EV sports carGuyton says the company’s plan to delay its EV rollout, and devote funding to hybrid powertrains, is the right answer for the current environment.“I think there's a lot of demand, there's a lot of interest [in EVs], but the technology and the scenery around it in terms of charging and so forth is not really mature yet,” he says. ""So we think that the customer experience right now suffers a bit, and that our formula can provide something more timely.”Speaking of timely: Mazda investors will be hoping Guyton and the management team in Japan are right and haven’t waited too long to begin its EV transformation.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, January 31, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations.Ashish Kohli: Thanks Michelle and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the fourth quarter and calendar year 2022. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today is Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; as well as Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&amp;A portion of the call. Before we begin, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements disclosure on the first page of our presentation. The content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.Mary Barra: Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I want to begin today's call by recognizing the General Motors team, all of our employees and including our dealers and suppliers. It takes experience, skill land teamwork to adjust to external factors like higher interest rates, commodity price increases and supply chain disruptions and deliver our commitments year in and year out. Our team rose to meet every challenge thrown at them in 2022 and they delivered record EBIT-adjusted and a year of first that really sets us apart from our competition. For exam, GM led the U.S. industry in total sales and delivered the largest year-over-year increase in market share of any OEM alongside record ATPs. This reflects the strength of our product portfolio including our clear leadership in full-size pickups and full-size SUVs, great quality, and improved availability.Story continuesChevrolet and GMC delivered more than 1.1 million full-size pickups, full-size SUVs and mid-size pickups in the U.S. which is about 350,000 units more than our closest competitor. Our commercial fleet business is another area where we gain considerable, profitable market share. The team has earned a business of more than 300 major commercial accounts over the last several years which led to our best year for commercial deliveries since 2006. The inflexion point was driven by our investment in mid-size and full-size pickups including our capacity expansions to build more crew cabs and heavy-duty pickups. Our growing portfolio of EVs will enhance our strong sales and share performance across the board because we are targeting the most popular segment at multiple price points.Auto, Automotive, DesignPhoto by Dylan McLeod on UnsplashThis year we will have nine EVs in the market in North America including the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV which saw record sales. In fact they were the bestselling mainstream EVs in the second half of the year and we plan to build more than 70,000 this year for North America and other markets. Quality is another area where our team deserves recognition. In the latest J.D. Power U.S. Initial Quality Study, GM improved while the industry went backwards. Not only did we get better, GM and the Buick brand led the industry. Chevrolet had six top-ranked vehicles and the Corvette was the highest-ranked nameplate in the industry. This commitment to satisfying customers and delivering industry leading quality, helped our eligible U.S. hourly employees earn record profit sharing totaling $500 million, which brings the three-year total to $1.2 billion.Looking ahead, we expect that 2023 will be another strong year for GM. We expect to deliver EBIT-adjusted in the range of $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion which reflects operating performance similar to 2022 when you include the normalization of GM Financial's results and pension accounting. Our guidance includes a total of $2 billion in cost savings in the automotive business over the next two years. The areas we are focusing on include continuing to reduce complexity at all of our products and reducing corporate overhead expenses across the board. I do want to be clear that we're not planning layoffs. We are limiting our hiring to only the most strategically important roles and we will use attrition to help manage overall headcount.Colorado and GMC pickup, our new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Heavy-Duty pickups, and the all new Chevrolet Trax which is the best entry-level Chevrolet we ever built.:We are especially excited about the Trax and so are our dealers in North America, Korea and other international markets.: The third generation, Chevrolet Montana pickup that we're launching in South America and Mexico starting next month, follows the same formula. The Montana's design is inspired by products like the Blazer and Trailblazer, and it will offer customers more room, the best combination of fuel economy and performance in its segment, and a comprehensive suite of safety features and an innovative reconfigurable bit. So let's talk about our growing EV portfolio. At our November Investor Day, we took you deep into the products and supporting strategies that will help us achieve solid EV profitability in 2025 and this is a breakout year for the Ultium Platform.Production at our Ultium Cells joint venture in Ohio is on track and the plant in Spring Hill will open later this year. Ultium Cells started hiring and training launch team members in October and they began equipment installation in November. These plants will help us meet pent up demand for the Cadillac LYRIQ. The GMC HUMMER EV pickup, and the BrightDrop Zevo 600, and it keeps our other EV launches on track. For example, BrightDrop continues to add new customers, including DHL Canada and they are on track to achieve the goal of $1 billion in revenue for the year. Excuse me. In April, we launched the Silverado EV work truck at Factory Zero for fleets. So we have opened up the order banks to begin converting initial demand for more than 200 customers into firm orders for 2023 production with the first deliveries in the spring.Interest is so strong that we believe demand will exceed supply in 2023 and into 2024. In the fall we will begin building the sold out Silverado RST First Edition, Chevrolet's flagship electric pickup, which will feature trailing capable super crews, four-wheel steering and a multi-flex midgate and up to 400 miles of range. We'll follow with other retail focused models in 2024, including the Silverado EV Trail Boss. This summer will also see the launches of the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Equinox EV. More than 40% of Blazer's reservation holders are new to EVs. Among the 60% who have owned an EV or hybrid, most are either Tesla customers or are our loyal Bolt EV and Bolt customers. What's common to everyone is they want an all-electric SUV that's stylish and roomy with enough range and fast charging capability to make it their daily driver, and they want it from a brand like Chevrolet with a proven record and reputation for quality.The Equinox EV has many of the same attributes and an even more affordable package, which makes it unique and another growth opportunity for GM. More than one third of the customers interested in the Equinox EV say affordability is their key consideration, and the latest data says nearly half live on the east or west coast or in Texas, which are all growth markets for us. This cadence of self-production and product launches combined with strong demand for the Bolt EV and EUV keeps us on track to produce 400,000 EVs in North America from 2022 to mid-2024 with the Ultium platform, volumes increasing significantly in the second half of this year.See also 25 Countries with the Lowest Corporate Tax Rates and 15 Most Undervalued Quality Stocks To Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.Alaska Air Group (ALK) is a stock many investors are watching right now. ALK is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 9.13. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 11.44. Over the past year, ALK's Forward P/E has been as high as 16.89 and as low as 7.32, with a median of 9.04.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is ALK's P/B ratio of 1.67. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 4.69. Over the past year, ALK's P/B has been as high as 2.04 and as low as 1.29, with a median of 1.54.Finally, our model also underscores that ALK has a P/CF ratio of 13.77. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. ALK's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 23.67. Within the past 12 months, ALK's P/CF has been as high as 14.09 and as low as 5.63, with a median of 8.92.Story continuesUnited Airlines (UAL) may be another strong Transportation - Airline stock to add to your shortlist. UAL is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value grade of A.Additionally, United Airlines has a P/B ratio of 2.28 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 4.69. For UAL, this valuation metric has been as high as 4.68, as low as 1.76, with a median of 2.96 over the past year.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Alaska Air Group and United Airlines strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, ALK and UAL look like an impressive value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more companies in this selection, check out 5 Most Valuable Retail Companies In The World. Retailers are facing challenges due to the rapid changes happening in the industry. Only a small portion of executives are confident about increasing profits in the upcoming year. Most expect inflation to affect their margins and anticipate a decrease in consumer spending due to financial worries. Despite the challenges, retailers have developed resilience in recent years. The pandemic caused significant changes in consumer demand, which led retailers to modernize their systems to better adapt to these changes. This includes improved analytics and strategies to maintain customer loyalty in response to changing consumer preferences.The Retail Industry: An AnalysisAccording to Deloitte, retail sales growth is expected to be limited by a slowing economy. In a baseline scenario with a 55% chance of happening, GDP growth is predicted to decrease from 2% in 2022 to 0.9% in 2023. Although a strong labor market will continue to drive sales, there is a risk of a recession which could lead to economic contraction and higher unemployment.Physical retail stores and online platforms are becoming important sources of advertising for vendors.

In addition to solid earnings, forecasts for the increasing expectations of a recession drove positive sentiment towards consumer discretionary companies with more predictable revenue like dollar stores.”12.

After a couple of years of bumpy performance due to closing stores during the height of the pandemic and absorbing rising supply chain costs, sales and margins have reverted towards more normal levels.

We had been concerned about China’s lack of respect for investor rights for some time, and Beijing has become significantly more aggressive in asserting itself of late. In addition, the legal structure Chinese companies use to come public in the U.S., a Cayman Islands shell corporation leaves American investors with an unsure path to recovering value should these companies cease to trade on U.S. exchanges. Because of the uncertainty, we exited our position in JD completely. We still love JD’s long-term prospects, but we cannot estimate the legal/regulatory risk associated with these companies anymore. More broadly, we are freeing up cash for some other positions we already own which have declined in this market, and after additional review, remain attractive.”9.

It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”8.

(NYSE:NKE) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Adobe and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) were solid performers in the quarter as some of the doom and gloom narratives around these companies have waned as they both saw strong recent business results. Nike has been dealing with weak demand in China (mostly due to rolling COVID lockdowns) but also a bloated inventory position in North American apparel as well. Supply chain issues caused delays in last year’s inventory shipments. As those were overcome, newer orders came in earlier than expected causing the spike in inventory. On its most recent earnings call, it became clear to us that this inventory spike is a temporary supply issue and narrowly focused in apparel. Demand for Nike products is strong, especially for footwear where nearly every geography grew over 30% in constant currencies in the past quarter. The company expects the inventory issue to be largely behind it in the next two to three quarters and is already seeing inventory levels decline sequentially.”6.

The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Valuable Retail Companies In The World.  Suggested articles:15 Biggest Neuroscience Companies in the World10 Recent Spinoff Companies Hedge Funds Are Buying15 Countries that Produce the Most Hydropower Disclosure: None. 15 Most Valuable Retail Companies In The World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

312,2224fe8a-b131-306b-84da-12fd47bbe6fe,RCL,2023-02-02,RCI Hospitality (RICK) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rci-hospitality-rick-earnings-expected-150003818.html,1675263603,STORY,"['RICK', 'RCL']","[The market expects RCI Hospitality (RICK) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis adult nightclub chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.7%.Revenues are expected to be $69.87 million, up 13% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.42% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for RCI Hospitality?For RCI Hospitality, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that RCI Hospitality will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that RCI Hospitality would post earnings of $1.41 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.45, delivering a surprise of +2.84%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.RCI Hospitality doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerRoyal Caribbean (RCL), another stock in the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.37 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +71.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.6 billion, up 165.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Royal Caribbean has been revised 25.6% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.97%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Royal Caribbean will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Visa Black Scholars also will participate in a Black Scholars Summit and be offered opportunities for paid internships, and those who meet program requirements will be invited to join Visa full-time after graduation.Since its August 2021 launch, the Visa Black Scholars and Jobs Program has supported 126 students as part of the company’s five-year $10 million investment in line with Visa’s inclusion and diversity efforts to drive lasting positive change.""It has been inspiring to see the positive effects that the Visa Black Scholars and Jobs Program has had on our scholars and company,"" said Michelle Gethers, Visa’s Chief Diversity Officer and Head of Corporate Responsibility.

While growth in 2021 also reflected the rebound from the deeper recession during the Covid-19 pandemic, last year’s growth is remarkable, given Italy’s significant exposure to the energy and cost-of-living crises, with average inflation exceeding 8%, and limited spending for Next Generation EU (NGEU) investments.Last year’s growth of 3.9%, including the -0.1% contraction in Q4, was better than Scope Ratings expected (3.7% for the year and -0.5% for Q4). While the economy has slowed, this mild contraction points to greater-than-expected resilience to the energy and inflation shocks, which is mirrored across the euro area, which grew by 0.1% in the fourth quarter.For 2023, we expect the Italian economy to avoid a recession and grow by at least 0.5%. The deceleration is due to the adverse impact of tight financing conditions, with an expected ECB deposit rate of at least 3.0% by the second half of this year and persistent inflationary pressures both curbing consumption and investment.Still, the government’s fiscal support for vulnerable households and the successful diversification of natural gas supplies away from Russia, which now constitute only 10% of Italian gas compared with 43% before Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine, should support the Italian economy’s resilience. In addition, we expect actual spending of NGEU funds to kick in this year, supporting investments, although implementation of EU disbursements into actual spending on the economy has been delayed vis-à-vis initial plans so far.Figure 1 – Italy and euro area GDP growth, QoQ %, SA, WDASource: Eurostat, Macrobond, Scope RatingsRobust Economic Performance Supports Italy’s Public FinancesFiscal revenues grew more than 10% in the first 11 months of 2022 compared with the same period of the previous year. Revenues were driven by higher income from indirect taxes, benefiting from elevated inflation, and by the phasing out of tax breaks enacted during the pandemic. Together with contained spending, this has supported the reduction in the fiscal deficit, which will likely have narrowed to 5.2% of GDP last year from 7.2% in 2021.Story continuesFor 2023, we expect the new government’s fiscal stance to remain relatively cautious in light of rising policy rates and thus to maintain an overall prudent fiscal policy. The 2023 Budget Bill balances the need to consolidate public finances with providing temporary relief from higher energy costs of around EUR 21bn (1.1% of GDP) in 2023.The fiscal deficit will narrow only modestly to 4.8% of GDP this year. The primary balance should, however, gradually improve and turn into a 1% of GDP surplus by 2026. A higher interest burden, set to exceed 4% of GDP over the coming years, should keep the headline deficit close to or above 3% of GDP in the medium term.Italy’s debt-to-GDP ratio is set to decline only modestly to around 142% by 2027, and thus remain around 10pp above its pre-Covid level, significantly above that of Portugal (forecast debt-to-GDP of 97% by 2027) and Spain (107%).Even with an expected primary surplus of 1% of GDP, which compares with an average primary surplus of 0.9% over the past 10 years excluding the Covid shock in 2020, it is hard to see how Italy’s public finances can be significantly consolidated further, not least due to rising fiscal pressures from the country’s ageing population.For this reason, in the absence of higher growth, Italy will remain the second-highest indebted country in the euro area after Greece. Italy could even become the most indebted country in Europe by the end of the decade if Greece sustains current growth and primary surpluses beyond 2027.Figure 2 – Public debt-to-GDP trajectories %Source: Eurostat, Macrobond, Scope RatingsItaly’s 2023 budget, while ensuring gradual fiscal consolidation, mostly includes one-off measures limited to a single fiscal year rather than structural measures aimed at improving Italy’s economic and fiscal outcomes over multiple years. The forthcoming revision and re-implementation of the EU’s fiscal framework will likely maintain the 3% fiscal deficit rule, anchoring expectations for Italy’s medium-term fiscal trajectory.Still, the swift implementation of growth-friendly NGEU-related reforms and the associated investment plan are critical to addressing Italy’s persistent structural problems, including stagnant productivity, low labour-force participation and employment rates, especially among women and the young, and rising pressures on pension and healthcare expenditure due to its ageing population.These reforms and investments are critical to raising Italy’s growth potential to 1.25-1.50% from around 1%. This is needed to achieve steady debt reduction over this decade, which is a key driver to support Italy’s BBB+/Stable credit ratings from Scope.For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.Alvise Lennkh-Yunus is the Deputy Head of Sovereign and Public Sector ratings at Scope Ratings GmbH.

As the price spread between Australian and European coal is wide, Japanese companies plan to increase imports from South Africa, a Tokyo-based coal trader said.""We are looking into diversifying supply sources in areas (outside of Australia) such as Africa and South America,"" Kazuhiro Ikebe, president of Kyushu Electric, said last month.JERA, Japan's biggest power generator, has modified some equipment at its coal power plants so that it can burn a wider variety of coal, which has already helped bring down the fuel cost by about 26 billion yen ($202 million) in the nine months ended Dec. 31, Tetsuo Yoshida, the head of finance, said.Hokuriku Electric Power, which like other Japanese utilities posted a record net loss in the nine month period ended Dec. 31 because of soaring import costs, will continue to seek high-grade coal ""as much as possible,"" a company official said.""But (we) will also use medium-grade coal in which the cost reduction benefit outweighs higher consumption volume and ash handling costs,"" the official added.REPLACING RUSSIACoal imports from Russia have been in sharp decline since mid-2022 and preliminary broker data suggests they have fallen close to zero for February, according to Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group.To replace Russian coal, Japan has increased coal imports from several sources, including Indonesia, Australia, South Africa and even occasional cargoes from the Americas, including Canada, Colombia, and the United States, he said.Japan's biggest coal-fired power generator, Electric Power Development Co Ltd, is considering buying coal from South Africa to diversify procurement sources, a spokesperson said.($1 = 128.4800 yen)(Reporting by Yuka Obayashi; Additional reporting by Katya Golubkova in Riga; Editing by Florence Tan and Jamie Freed)]"

West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) settled at $75.88 a barrel, down 53 cents, or 0.7%.While new orders for U.S. manufactured goods rose broadly in December, orders for industrial equipment and other machinery fell, according to the latest Commerce Department data.""It was highlighting more slowing in the economy, particularly on the industrial side, which is a negative for petroleum,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital.A rebound in the dollar index, which hit a nine-month low earlier in the session on softer U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike bets, also weighed on oil prices, according to Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates. A stronger greenback makes dollar-priced oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.The Fed raised its target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, but continued to promise ""ongoing increases"" in borrowing costs as part of its battle against inflation.""Inflation has eased somewhat but remains elevated,"" the U.S. central bank said in a statement that marked an explicit acknowledgement of the progress made in lowering the pace of price increases from the 40-year highs hit last year.While inflation appears to have slowed in major economies, the response of central banks and the speed of reopening from COVID-19 lockdowns is uncertain.""Investors have become less confident in the strength of the outlook; something we could see change repeatedly in this first quarter due to the lack of visibility on interest rates and China's COVID transition,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.Helping to keep oil from moving lower was a European Union ban on Russian refined products set to take effect on Feb. 5, potentially dealing a blow to global supply.Story continuesEU countries will seek a deal on Friday on a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products after postponing a decision on Wednesday because of divisions among member states, diplomats said.The European Commission proposed last week that from Feb. 5 the EU apply a price cap of $100 a barrel on premium Russian oil products such as diesel and a $45 per barrel cap on discounted products such as fuel oil.Meanwhile, an OPEC+ panel endorsed the producer group's current output policy at a meeting on Wednesday, leaving production cuts agreed last year unchanged amid hopes of higher Chinese demand and uncertain prospects for Russian supply.(Additional reporting by Noah Browning in London;Editing by Marguerita Choy, Will Dunham, Kirsten Donovan and David Gregorio)]"

Meanwhile, the annual decline in new listings also moderated to single digits in January; new listings remain an important indicator of home selling interest, and a sustained improvement would suggest more sellers are returning to the market in the coming months.""Home buying in January remained relatively sluggish as sales slowed, inventories rose, and price growth leveled off. These trends reinforce that while buyers are gaining an advantage in the market, they are still being deterred by high home prices and financing costs,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""Even as inventories climb and prices moderate, homeowners have equity and advantages in the market but need to set their expectations accordingly. For renters looking to become homeowners this year our Best Markets for First-Time Homebuyers identified pockets of affordability across the country, particularly in the northeast, where they might be able to better overcome affordability challenges and find a better deal."" January 2023 Housing Metrics – National MetricChange over Jan. 2022Change over Jan 2019Median listing price8.1% (to $400,000)38.1 %Active listings65.5 %-43.6 %New listings-5.4 %-27.1 %Median days on market+13 days (to 75 days)-12 daysShare of active listings with price reductions+9.3 percentage points (to 15.3%)-0.3 percentage points Spotlight On: Affordable metros in the Midwest and Northeast gain in popularity The Realtor.com® Q4 Cross-Market Demand Report also released today highlights regional variations in home buying activity and shows that in the face of higher affordability challenges more home buyers are on the move this year. Across the top 100 metros in Q4 2022, 55.5% of listing views on Realtor.com® went to properties located outside of the shoppers' metro area, compared to 55.0% during the previous quarter and 53.4% in the same time last year. Regionally, shoppers in the West (63.0%) and Northeast (57.0%) were mostly likely to search out-of-market last quarter.Story continuesMarkets in the Midwest and Northeast that can offer shoppers more affordable deals gained the most popularity from out-of-market shoppers last quarter, including Pittsburgh; Buffalo, N.Y.; Syracuse, N.Y.; Albany, N.Y.; and Cleveland, Ohio. Markets that saw the greatest decline in out-of-market home shoppers were Austin, Texas; Seattle; Knoxville, Tenn.; Albuquerque, N.M.; and Ogden, Utah. High financial costs likely made Phoenix and Los Angeles less desirable destinations for both local and out-of-metro home shoppers last quarter compared to the prior year, which aligns with Realtor.com®'s 2023 Housing Forecast, which predicted large year-over-years sales declines in those two metros.Gradually cooling markets gives buyers more homes to choose from Nationally, the number of active listings in January continued to climb higher, suggesting that less competition and more time to make home buying decisions weren't enough to spur buyer demand in the face of high mortgage rates and home prices. Pending listings, or homes under contract with a buyer, continued to drop, as did the number of newly listed homes. This month's decline in new listings is the smallest since last July, and the South saw an increase in new listings, which means more, fresh for-sale options for homebuyers.In January, the active inventory of homes for sale grew 65.5% year-over-year in, but is still 43.2% lower than it was before the pandemic (January 2017-2019 average).Both pending listings, or homes under contract with a buyer (-31.9%), and newly-listed homes (-5.4%), declined year-over-year. The decline in new listings is much lower than last month's 21.0% decrease and November's 17.2% decrease and the smallest decline since last July's 6.8% decrease.Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, 49 markets posted yearly active inventory gains in January, led by Nashville, Tenn. (+303.5%), Austin, Texas (+260.4) and Raleigh, N.C. (+254.8%). The only metro to see inventory decline on a year-over-year basis was Hartford, Conn. (-8.0%).On average across the 50 largest metros, only the South saw year-over-year new listings increase in January (+5.4%). Twelve metros saw the number of newly listed homes increase compared to last year, up from only two markets in December, all of these markets were located in the South, with Raleigh, N.C. (+49.0%), Nashville, Tenn. (+45.3%), and Austin, Texas (+24.9%) seeing the greatest increases.Buyers see slower price growth and have more time for decision making on a purchaseIn January, the U.S. median listing price remained unchanged from December. Growth in the typical asking price (+8.1% year over year) also remained little changed from last month, after six months of decelerating price growth, suggesting a potential slowdown in the normalization of prices that could continue as we head further into 2023. As the number of homes for sale continues to rise, sellers were more than twice as likely as last year to reduce the asking price for their home. Homes also spent more time on market than last year, with homes in western metros spending 12 days more on the market compared to pre-pandemic times, but in all other regions homes are still selling more quickly than 2017–2019, on average.The U.S. median listing price was $400,000 in January, up 8.1% year-over-year, which is only a slight change from the December growth rate.The share of homes with price reductions increased from 6.0% in January 2022 to 15.3% this year. This is generally higher than it was before the pandemic, but is still slightly lower than 2019 levels (15.6%).The typical home spent 75 days on the market in January, 13 days longer than last year, but still 16 days faster than 2017–2019, on average.Across the 50 largest U.S. metros, 45 metros saw an increase in time on market compared to the same time last year, with the greatest increases seen in Raleigh, N.C. (+41 days), Las Vegas and Denver (+40 days, respectively). Only three markets saw shrinking time on market, including Richmond, Va. (-20 days), Milwaukee (-8 days), and Buffalo, N.Y. (-3 days). Q4 Cross-Market Demand Housing Metrics RegionShare of Outbound Views to Other Metros (2022Q4) Share of Outbound Views to Other Metros (2021Q4) Midwest51.7 %49.1 %Northeast57.0 %52.9 %South52.2 %50.5 %West63.0 %62.4 %Top 100 metros55.5 %53.4 %*Note: Regional Q4 2022 Cross-Market Demand metrics include top 100 metros across the U.S. 50 States and District of Columbia. January 2023 Housing Metrics – 50 Largest U.S. Metro Areas Metro AreaMedian Listing PriceMedian Listing Price YoYMedian Listing Price per Sq.

With the company checking all the boxes, Wall Street analysts said investors should turn their attention to the massive share repurchase plan. Shares last traded up 1%.T-Mobile, the U.S.'s second-biggest wireless operator since its merger with Sprint, said revenue fell 2.5% from a year earlier to $20.27 billion, some 2% below market consensus, despite adding substantially to its subscriber base in the year. As such, it joined rivals AT&amp;T (T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in posting lackluster numbers for the quarter that were marked by an intensifying fight to win customers as disposable incomes were squeezed by high inflation in the second half of last year.Diluted earnings per share over the whole of 2022 were down 15% from 2021's levels at $2.06, despite a rebound in the fourth quarter to $1.18 - up 250% from 2021.T-Mobile gained a net 927,000 new post-paid phone subscribers in the fourth quarter and 3.1 million over the year as a whole. This makes T-Mobile the only operator to grow year-over-year. It expects this growth to accelerate in 2023, adding between 5M and 5.5M new customers on a net basis.The company was still upbeat about its prospects for the coming year, forecasting core adjusted earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization to grow around 10% to just under $30B, and free cash flow to grow 75% to around $13.35B.In part that's down to the realization of efficiency gains from the merger, which T-Mobile estimates at as much as $7.5B this year (up from $6B last year).A third of that represents reductions in selling, general and administrative costs, while another $1.6B comes from rationalizing network investment costs. Merger-related costs, meanwhile, are expected to be much less, at $1B before taxes.Story continuesWhile T-Mobile ""checked all the boxes"" for the final quarter and outlook for 2023, MoffettNathanson's analyst said T-Mobile’s outsized plan for share repurchases is an ""encore"" for Wall Street. With the plan, the analyst said, ""[w]e are now at the front edge of T-Mobile’s next chapter.""MoffettNathanson highlights that T-Mobile is planning an ""astounding"" $60B of share repurchases over the next three years. ""Assuming that parent Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) does NOT sell into the buy-backs, T-Mobile’s public float will shrink by something like two-thirds,"" the analyst comments. The analyst feels that a buyback of that magnitude is non in the stock price yet.(Article originally published at 8:05am ET (13:05 GMT))Related ArticlesT-Mobile gains after delivering in 2022, focus turns to massive buybackPolish competition watchdog accuses Amazon EU of misleading consumersApple, Alphabet, Amazon.com earnings: 3 things to watch]"

Supplementary historical financial information reflecting the Security divestiture recorded in discontinued operations is available on the investor section of the website or can be accessed directly through the following link:  Supplemental Historical Financial Information.4Q'22 Key Points:Net sales for the quarter were $4.0 billion, flat versus prior year as strategic outdoor power equipment acquisitions (+7%) and price realization (+7%), were offset by lower volume (-10%), currency (-3%) and the previously announced Oil &amp; Gas divestiture (-1%).Inventory at the end of the quarter was $5.9 billion, down approximately $500 million from the prior quarter and down $775 million in the second half, a reflection of improving supply chain conditions and benefits from our planned production curtailments.Gross margin for the quarter was 18.9%. Adjusted gross margin* was 19.5%, down 950 basis points from prior year, as price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation, lower volumes, and higher supply chain costs, including the impact of planned production curtailments. The impact from production curtailments and destocking high-cost inventory reduced gross margin by approximately 6 to 7 points.SG&amp;A expenses were 19.0% of sales for the quarter. Excluding charges, fourth quarter adjusted SG&amp;A expenses* were 18.3% of sales, down 180 basis points versus prior year due to the successful implementation of cost control actions.The tax rate was a benefit for the quarter reflecting the impact of discrete tax benefits.*  Non-GAAP Financial Measure As Further Defined On Page 64Q'22 Segment Results($ in M) Sales Profit Charges1ProfitEx- Charges*Profit RateProfit RateEx- Charges*Tools &amp; Outdoor$3,383$  3.4$29.8$33.20.1 %1.0 %Industrial$604$68.2$  1.4$69.611.3 %11.5 %1 See Acquisition-Related And Other Charges On Page 5Tools &amp; Outdoor net sales were in-line with 4Q'21 as higher sales related to the December 2021 outdoor acquisitions (+8%) and improved price realization (+7%) were offset by lower volume (-12%) and currency (-3%). The overall organic* decline (-5%) was a result of lower consumer and DIY market demand. Regional year-over-year organic* revenue included: Emerging markets (+1%), Europe (-3%), and North America (-7%). U.S. retail point-of-sale demand for the quarter was similar to demand levels from the third quarter, supported by price increases and professional demand. The Tools &amp; Outdoor segment profit rate*, excluding charges, was 1.0%. The segment profit rate*, excluding charges, declined from 11.4% in fourth quarter 2021 as the benefit from price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation, higher supply chain costs, production curtailment costs and lower volume.Industrial net sales were down 1% versus fourth quarter 2021 as price (+9%) and volume (+1%) were more than offset by currency (-5%) and the Oil &amp; Gas divestiture (-6%).

In 2022 the Company's global cost reduction program realized a total of $200 million in savings towards its stated goals.  In addition, the Company reduced inventory by approximately $500 million sequentially versus the prior quarter and expects further inventory and working capital reductions to support free cash flow generation in 2023.2023 Outlook Corbin Walburger, Interim CFO, commented, ""We made tangible progress executing our plan in the fourth quarter, including substantially reducing inventory and generating over $500 million of free cash flow.  As we execute in 2023, we are prepared to navigate a range of demand possibilities, while delivering on our business transformation.  Consistent with the plan we outlined last year, we expect the impact of targeted production curtailments will continue to weigh on margins through the first half of 2023 as we prioritize cash generation to position the Company for gross margin expansion and enhanced balance sheet strength.  We are confident that by executing on our core priorities we are positioning the Company for long-term value creation.""Management expects 2023 EPS to be in the range of ($1.65) to $0.85 on a GAAP basis, and between $0.00 to $2.00 on an adjusted* basis. The band reflects the wider range of 2023 demand possibilities and destocking scenarios with an EPS loss expected in the front half as the Company prioritizes free cash flow generation.  These scenarios will be discussed in more detail on today's earnings call.  Free cash flow* is expected to approximate $0.5 billion to $1.0 billion, significantly ahead of net income, as the Company focuses on serving its customers while leveraging the SBD Operating Model to drive working capital efficiency.The difference between 2023 GAAP and adjusted EPS guidance is approximately $1.15 to $1.65, consisting of integration-related charges and other charges primarily due to supply chain transformation under the Global Cost Reduction Program.*  Non-GAAP Financial Measure As Further Defined On Page 6Acquisition-Related And Other ChargesTotal pre-tax acquisition-related and other charges in the fourth quarter of 2022 were $54.0 million, primarily related to supply chain transformation and integration-related costs.

Operating profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating margin is operating profit as a percentage of sales. Operating profit and operating margin are shown both inclusive and exclusive of acquisition-related and other charges. Management uses operating profit and operating margin as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole, as well as the related measures at the segment level. Diluted EPS, excluding charges, or adjusted EPS, is diluted GAAP EPS excluding the impacts of acquisition-related and other charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity, as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners, and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the Company's common and preferred stock and business acquisitions, among other items.  Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 15. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results, business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of acquisition-related and other charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.CAUTIONARY STATEMENTSUnder the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995This document contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Top Performing Bitcoin Stocks in January.Cryptocurrencies and tech stocks are back in action as investors grow hopeful that the Federal Reserve would slow down and eventually halt interest rate hikes this year.  S&amp;P 500 had its best January since 2019. The Nasdaq Composite also added 10% in the month. Growth stock investors also had a banner month in January. ARK Innovation ETF, headed by Cathie Wood, gained about 27% in January. The rally in the ETF was helped by big gains posted by companies like Roku, Netflix and Tesla.ARK Invest in its latest Big Ideas 2023 report reiterated its prediction that Bitcoin price will hit $1 million by 2023. ARK Invest had mentioned the same price target for Bitcoin in its 2022 Big Ideas report. This shows that the Cathie Wood-led firm has a long-term outlook on the crypto markets which remained unchanged despite the tough market conditions and huge losses seen last year.In the short term Cathie Wood has reportedly said at several occasions that in the next three years Bitcoin price could touch $500,000.The latest market rally has caused a stir on social media and in investment circles. Some believe the rally is short-lived. Famous investor Michael Burry tweeted “Sell,” in his trademark mysterious style. On the other hand, Jim Cramer has said we are now in a bull market and the latest dip presents an opportunity to buy stocks.Some analysts believe the latest rally in the crypto markets has more room to run as retail traders, who were holding back on any activity amid a broader lull in the markets, will start buying, driven by FOMO, or fear of missing out. According to a Bloomberg report, Noelle Acheson of “Crypto Is Macro Now” newsletter said that FOMO is expected to “play a role in how the market evolves from here.” The Bloomberg report also quoted  researcher Kaiko who said on Twitter that average size of trades indicate that “whales” are driving the rally.Story continuesBitcoin and crypto ETFs also had a remarkable month in January. These ETFs were languishing for a long time amid a bearish trend in the market.

During the most recent quarter the Company reported +14% growth in currency-adjusted total payment value (TPV) which helped drive +12% revenue growth. Management gave a cautious outlook for the holiday season as its core e-commerce addressable market continues to normalize post-Pandemic. With most of the disruptions related to eBay and also Pandemic normalization largely complete, PayPal can resume its margin expansion efforts in the new year as its payment’s platform remains highly scalable. Meanwhile, disruption in capital markets should hamper its unprofitable competitors in the payments space and allow for more opportunities related to M&amp;A.”12. Block, Inc.

Since our initial purchase in 2013, NVDA has seen its stock decline 50% one other time, back in 2018. The best-performing businesses and stocks do not go up and to the right. Mr. Market gets moody, and even one of the highest quality companies in the world is not immune. Drawdowns of this magnitude are challenging to stomach, even though the stock is up 50x in less than ten years. While we consider ourselves old school value investors, we continue to hold this fantastic company even though, optically, it does not appear cheap. Our confidence in Jensen remains, and while gaming is no longer in hyper-growth mode, the Data Center segment continues to grow. AI, Automotive, and other small but rapidly growing industries are the next leg of the story. Chris Mayer discusses the position in greater detail with commentary from our CIO, Peter O’Keefe.

Now, the company will need all the cash flow from the business just to pay off the interest payments on the enormous debt load, leaving no earnings for equity holders. Despite shares down over 60% for the year, the company continues to trade at a material premium to the value of its assets. For more detail on our thesis, please see our blog post here, as well as the Forbes and Fortune write-ups that feature our short position.”6. Coinbase Global, Inc.

For more companies, head on over to Top 5 Smartest Companies To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Surviving in the modern day corporate world is not for the faint of heart. Business is a ruthless endeavor, and shareholder and investor interest reign supreme for each company. The companies that have survived, and have turned into modern day giants and/or disrupted industries are ones that have beaten the competition by introducing unique products and services and capturing consumer attention through marketing campaigns. America, which has the largest and most developed corporate sector in the world (even the universe maybe, unless NASA finds aliens), is full of companies that disrupted industries and become corporate giants — even closing in on the African continent's GDP when it comes to market capitalization. Africa's nominal GDP is slated to be $3.14 trillion by 2023 according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), while the two most valuable American firms — Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) — have a combined market capitalization of $4.16 trillion.Both have led the charge and transformed entire industries. For Apple, its biggest strength is the manufacturing supply chain that enables it to pump out millions of iPhones each year. For Microsoft,  it has been the ability to target the highest growing industries and become a dominant player in them. The best example of this is the Azure cloud computing and data center platform, which grew 40% on a YoY basis in the second quarter of 2022.Marcin Balcerzak/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has taken a wager at trying to identify the smartest companies in the world.

Here are three things you need to know this morning. A bullish or bearish message for the markets, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will speak at 2:00 PM today after the FOMC makes its decision, expected to make its smallest rate hike in nearly a year of 25 basis points.- And Snap's market value is vanishing. Following another brutal earnings report, the company's weak outlook casting fresh doubts on the social media plays future.- And Advanced Micro Devices or AMD topped earnings expectations for the fourth quarter despite slowing demand for PCs. We're going to dive into those earnings in just a minute. But first, let's take a look back at what some investors are calling big Jan out there in the markets as we start a new trading month here in February.You've got one friend of the show Carson Group Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick calling this the bullish slingshot and saying it is here. And here's why because after a big January, like the one that we did see in the markets, the average full year gain is 29% for the S&amp;P 500. And that's coming after-- that's when we have that big January, after a down year, which is exactly what we see. Now, in terms of some of the sector performers over the course of January, you had the out-sized move to the upside in consumer discretionary. Also communications services that moved higher by about 15% as well.And in addition, some of the other largest decliners in 2022 where the biggest or out-sized move to the upside in the beginning of 2023. Technology and real estate, both of those up more than 9%. Let's also take a look at some of those individual movers. And for some of the mega-cap tech stocks, that's where you actually saw the biggest rebound here. Take a look at Tesla. That moved higher in January by about 40% there. NVIDIA also moved up by about 33%, 34%. Amazon, also a big move there. So that just kind of continues the theme for some of the bigger decliners, the largest decliners, that we saw getting a little bit of a rebound coming into the start of this year. But again, it's all still relative here as well.Story continues- Yeah, exactly. And really, the question is, will the Federal Reserve come in here and want to smack down the advances that we have seen in the market? That's the big question. We have seen that happen before, right? With past meetings where the Federal Reserve and its participants felt that the action we were seeing in the markets did not fully reflect the outlook for rates. So then that raises the question of, are we going to get different rhetoric here today from the Federal Reserve?- Yeah, and it's to be determined. I'm looking at this good note from Goldman Sachs. I love their research. But this is the vibe coming into this Fed meeting. Goldman notes this, how many rate hikes will be needed to stay on this path is less clear. They expect to additional 25 basis point hikes in March and May, but fewer might be needed if a weak business confidence depresses hiring investment. Or more might be needed if the economy really accelerates. So it's just absolute confusion, I would say, into this meeting. And that ultimately falls on Jay Powell to come out here and just, I think, provide clearer market, clearer guidance to a market to Brad's point that just had a big Jan.- Yeah, and so within that big Jan, what you had the absence of, as we've been discussing, was the Federal Reserve here? And of course, that meeting, that FOMC meeting kicking off on the 31st. And now, we'll get a decision here today on the 1st of February. One huge thing to continue to keep in mind going forward is, of course, not just how much of an out-sized impact any type of pause or pivot could have on the markets and the reaction that they may have in celebration. But then to the other side, what if the Fed goes against what that expectation is and actually is still remaining more aggressive almost kind of heeding the advice of the IMF?- I mean, I think, I feel like that is kind of-- that is kind of the expectation at this point. I mean, it feels like the market is leaning a little bit more on hawkish expectation than dovish expectation. At this point, yes, we've seen the big January rally. But then over the past couple of days, we've seen a little bit of shakiness to that rally. So I do wonder if investors are sort of bracing themselves rather than thinking the Fed's going to-- I think, there's little chance that the Fed is going to signal an all clear here.And I think execs are waiting too. And I know I'm guilty of this too. I always view that execs don't pay as much to the Federal Reserve as we here do in the business news community. But, you know, I spoke to Otis' CEO Judy Marks and she was she's paying very careful attention. They reported earnings this morning they beat, but they have very careful attention to the outlook for rates this year. And she made a good point that if rates continue to go up, it might impact their backlog and their business plans later this year in terms of new development. Not just here in the US, but Europe and certainly China.- Well, that's kind of the sentiment that you heard even from the conversations you guys were having at Davos because from what the execs were somewhat signaling is that we can't really do anything about what the Fed is going to do. They're going to act as they feel necessary for the economy, but at the same time, we can be as proactive. And in some cases, they've been extremely reactive. But as proactive as we can in this instance, which means drumming up new business deals, which means some of the cost restructuring within our own company and corporation. And I think at this point too for what they're listening for from the Fed, it's more about how the demand environment can impact them if they continue to be hawkish or aggressive from the Fed. How that impacts their own consumers that they're going after right now too.- Yeah.]"

347,1f569e16-d68f-3f88-b272-e0a2778c0643,MCK,2023-02-02,Henry Schein (HSIC) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/henry-schein-hsic-report-q4-164304712.html,1675269784,STORY,"['HSIC', 'CAH', 'LH', 'MCK']","[Henry Schein, Inc. HSIC is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 16, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.15 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.88%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average beat being 7.7%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors to NoteDental BusinessHenry Schein’s Dental business is likely to have gained in Q4 from the acquisition of Midway Dental. This newly-added business is expected to have strengthened the company’s long-standing presence in the Midwest of the United States, providing dental customers of Midway access to an expanded portfolio of solutions.Added to this, improved patient traffic as COVID-led severity gradually declines globally. The business is likely to have benefited from strong global equipment sales, similar to the last reported quarter, as dentists continue to invest in their practices. The dental business is likely to have seen robust sales contributions from dental specialty products, specifically within the oral surgery category.Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHenry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHenry Schein, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Henry Schein, Inc. QuoteHowever, the company’s consumable merchandise internal sales growth in local currencies, excluding PP&amp;E and COVID-related products, might have been impacted by the industrywide trend of staffing shortages in Q4.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter global Dental business revenues is pegged at $1.99 billion, suggesting a 1.3% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Medical BusinessThe medical business is expected to have gained from improved U.S. patient traffic to physician offices, ultimate care sites and ambulatory surgical centers. The segment is likely to have witnessed continued demand for medical laboratory equipment and non-COVID point-of-care diagnostic tests, as it did in the previous quarter.Story continuesHowever, sales of personal protective equipment (PPE) products and COVID-19 test kits are likely to have continued the downward rally with declining COVID-19 cases globally in Q4 compared with the year-ago period. Added to this, fourth-quarter sales are expected to have faced a challenging year-over-year comparison when patient traffic to physician offices was bolstered by a surge in Delta variant cases.Further, Henry Schein earlier expected further pricing declines for gloves in the second half of 2022. We expect all these to have impacted the company’s fourth-quarter revenues.Meanwhile, in terms of COVID-19 test sales, the company is likely to have witnessed sequentially higher COVID-19 testing demand in Q4, attributable to increased infection rates in several geographies.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter global Medical business revenues is pegged at $1.15 billion, suggesting a rise of 1.3% from the year-ago quarter reported figure.Technology and Value-Added Services BusinessHenry Schein’s technology and value-added services business is likely to have gained from continued strength in Henry Schein One, which provides one of the broadest product offerings of dental practice management and related software and services. The company is expected to have shown strength in its practice management business, including Dentrix practice management software and Dentrix Ascend.The growth within Henry Schein One in the third quarter was primarily driven by a recovery in patient traffic to dental offices and growth within the company’s cloud-based solutions. Healthy demand from the company’s national DSO accounts for Dentrix Ascend and Dentally cloud-based solutions contributed to the growth. We expect this growth momentum to have continued in Q4, benefiting the business.As of now, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter global Technology and Valued-Added Services business revenues is pegged at $187 million, suggesting an improvement of 5.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Estimate PictureFor fourth-quarter 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $3.35 billion implies an improvement of 0.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.21, indicating an increase of 13.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is Laboratory Corp. of America (LH). LH is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 14.12, which compares to its industry's average of 18.37.

LH's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 6.36. Over the past 12 months, LH's P/B has been as high as 2.63 and as low as 1.84, with a median of 2.16.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that LH has a P/CF ratio of 9.40.

Over the past year, LH's P/CF has been as high as 9.65 and as low as 7.12, with a median of 8.41.Investors could also keep in mind McKesson (MCK), an Medical - Dental Supplies stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Shares of McKesson currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 14.51, and its PEG ratio is 1.44. In comparison, its industry sports average P/E and PEG ratios of 18.37 and 1.71.Over the last 12 months, MCK's P/E has been as high as 15.66, as low as 11.49, with a median of 14.01, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.56, as low as 0.99, with a median of 1.43.Furthermore, McKesson holds a P/B ratio of -42.99 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 6.36.

The results have already started to show as The Big Money Show witnessed a strong debut by acquiring 165,000 viewers in its first week while The Bottom Line secured double-digit growth year over year with 236,000 viewers.Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteThe growth in these shows is expected to benefit the overall viewership at FBN, which declined to 134,000 total viewers in 2022 compared to 180,000 in 2021. This will also help aid the company’s top line in the coming quarters, which showed slow growth, with 4.8% year-over-year growth in revenues for the first quarter of 2023 compared with 12% growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.The decline in viewership comes as a result of cord-cutting. Per Techjury, 55.1% of U.S. consumers have cut the cord by 2022 and are accessing TV content through the Internet. This is a prolonged threat to the company as cord-cutting rates are expected to increase in the future.Shares of Fox have declined 16.6% in the past year compared with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector, which fell 19.8% in the same time frame.Story continuesZack Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderFox currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Manchester United MANU and Stride LRN, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Shares of Manchester United have gained 64.8% in the past year.

Robinson Worldwide (CHRW) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.03 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.74 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -23.70%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this trucking company would post earnings of $2.15 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.78, delivering a surprise of -17.21%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.C.H. Robinson , which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Services industry, posted revenues of $5.07 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.55%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $6.5 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.C.H. Robinson shares have added about 9.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.2%.What's Next for C.H. Robinson?While C.H. Robinson has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for C.H. Robinson: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.20 on $5.21 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.37 on $21.51 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

""The current point in the cycle is one of shippers managing through elevated inventories amidst slowing economic growth, causing unseasonably soft demand for transportation services. At the same time, prices for ground transportation and global freight forwarding are declining due to the changing balance of supply and demand. While a correction in the freight forwarding market was certainly expected, the speed and magnitude of the correction in only two quarters was unexpected, with ocean rates on some trade lanes already back to pre-pandemic levels.""Story continues""I believe we’re uniquely positioned in the marketplace to deliver for our shippers, carriers and shareholders through a combination of our digital solutions, our global suite of services and our network of global logistics experts,"" Anderson added.Summary of Fourth Quarter Results Compared to the Fourth Quarter of 2021Total revenues decreased 22.1% to $5.1 billion, driven by lower pricing and volume across most of our services.Gross profits decreased 10.5% to $761.5 million.

Personnel expenses increased 1.7% to $427.3 million, primarily due to $21.5 million of restructuring-related costs, which were partially offset by a decrease in equity compensation. Selling, general and administrative (""SG&amp;A"") expenses of $176.8 million increased 18.7%, primarily due to $15.2 million of restructuring charges, primarily related to an impairment of internally developed software, and increased legal settlements, partially offset by a decrease in credit losses.Income from operations totaled $164.0 million, down 42.9% due to the decrease in adjusted gross profits and $36.7 million of restructuring charges. Adjusted operating margin of 21.4% declined 1,220 basis points.Interest and other income/expense, net totaled $42.5 million of expense, consisting primarily of $24.8 million of interest expense, which increased $10.7 million versus last year due primarily to higher short-term average interest rates, and $16.9 million of foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses, which increased $10.4 million versus last year primarily due to foreign currency revaluation on intercompany assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. Dollars in countries where the U.S. Dollar is not the functional currency.The effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.9% compared to 14.5% in the fourth quarter last year. The lower rate in the fourth quarter of last year was due primarily to a favorable mix of foreign earnings and an increased benefit related to U.S. tax credits and incentives.Net income totaled $96.2 million, down 58.2% from a year ago. Diluted EPS of $0.80 decreased 54.0%. Adjusted EPS of $1.03 decreased 40.8%.Summary of Full Year Results Compared to 2021Total revenues increased 6.9% to $24.7 billion, driven primarily by higher pricing in truckload, less-than truckload (""LTL"") and ocean services.Gross profits increased 13.9% to $3.6 billion.

Personnel expenses increased 11.6% to $1.7 billion, primarily due to higher average employee headcount, which increased 11.7%. SG&amp;A expenses increased 14.6% to $603.4 million, primarily due to increases in purchased and contracted services, legal settlements, travel expenses and an impairment of internally developed software, partially offset by a $25.3 million gain on the sale-leaseback of our Kansas City regional center and a decrease in credit losses.Income from operations totaled $1.3 billion, up 17.1% from last year, primarily due to the increase in adjusted gross profits, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses. Adjusted operating margin of 35.3% increased 100 basis points.Interest and other income/expense, net totaled $100.0 million of expense, which primarily consisted of $77.1 million of interest expense, which increased $25.0 million versus last year due to a higher average debt balance. The year-to-date results also included a $23.5 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses, which increased $8.4 million versus last year primarily due to foreign currency revaluation on intercompany assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. Dollars in countries where the U.S. Dollar is not the functional currency.The effective tax rate for the full year was 19.4% compared to 17.4% in the year-ago period.

The difference between adjusted gross profits and gross profits is not material.Fourth quarter Robinson Fresh adjusted gross profits increased 9.5% to $28.5 million, driven by an increase in adjusted gross profit per case, which is primarily related to integrated supply chain and technology services and a 2.5% increase in case volume.

The lower rate in the fourth quarter of last year was due primarily to a favorable mix of foreign earnings and an increased benefit related to U.S. tax credits and incentives. We expect our 2023 full-year effective tax rate to be 19% to 21%.Interest and other income/expense, net totaled $42.5 million of expense, consisting primarily of $24.8 million of interest expense, which increased $10.7 million versus the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to higher average interest rates, and $16.9 million of foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses.Diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter were down 9.2% due primarily to share repurchases over the past twelve months.Cash Flow Generation and Capital DistributionCash generated from operations totaled $773.4 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $75.9 million cash generated from operations in the fourth quarter of 2021. The $697.5 million improvement was primarily due to a $649.9 million sequential decrease in net operating working capital in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to a $199.9 million sequential increase in the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease in net operating working capital in the fourth quarter of 2022 resulted primarily from a $916.5 million sequential decrease in accounts receivable and contract assets, compared to a $266.6 million sequential decrease in total accounts payable and accrued transportation expense in the fourth quarter of 2021.In the fourth quarter of 2022, cash returned to shareholders increased 128% versus last year to $507.2 million, with $438.1 million in repurchases of common stock and $69.1 million in cash dividends.Capital expenditures totaled $27.8 million in the quarter.

They use a common base engine with cylinder heads and fuel systems that can be specifically tailored for hydrogen, natural gas, advanced diesel and biofuels to reduce carbon emissions.The new platform is part of the company's Destination Zero strategy to reduce carbon in Cummins' internal combustion engines through low-carbon fuels and other means, while also bringing to market the low- and no-carbon technologies likely to power the future, including battery electric and hydrogen fuel cells.The company's New Power business segment is also manufacturing electrolyzers to separate hydrogen from water. No-carbon green hydrogen is produced when renewable forms of energy are used to power the process.Cummins wants to give customers a variety of options to reduce carbon, so they can choose the one that best fits their unique circumstances. In some applications, customers may be ready for zero emission solutions today, but those solutions may not be a good fit in other applications and circumstances.Either way, Cummins believes the world needs to begin reducing carbon immediately to achieve its climate goals. Waiting will merely make carbon reduction efforts an even bigger challenge.The 15-liter hydrogen engine will be available with ratings from 400-to-530 horsepower (hp) and a peak torque of 2600 Newton metres (Nm). For applications powered by renewable biogas, the engine will offer ratings from 400-to-510 hp with a peak torque of 2500 Nm available. The advanced diesel version will offer a broad power range of 450-to-650 hp, with 3200 Nm peak torque.Cummins believes it can play a leadership role in climate action because of the wide number of commercial power applications the company serves. Cummins technology powers commercial trucking, buses, passenger trains, marine applications, farm and construction equipment and commercial generators that provide emergency power to schools, hospitals, data centers and more.Story continuesCummins fuel-agnostic engines are part of the company's Destination Zero strategy for decarbonizationView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cummins-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/737693/Cummins-To-Showcase-Lower-Carbon-Engines-to-Construction-Industry]"

His main corporate experience was at Citigroup Inc.In the letter, Trian also directed its criticism at the full Disney board, blaming it for a 44% drop in Disney's stock last year. It argued board directors failed to ""instill a culture of accountability,"" did not properly plan for Bob Iger's succession as chief executive, own very little stock, and they did not ""heed constructive shareholder input.""Story continuesIger returned to the top job in November from retirement after Disney fired his successor, Bob Chapek, after the company reported a 66% drop in quarterly profit.The Disney directors, who include the chief executives of car maker General Motors, biotechnology company Illumina Inc, and sports apparel firm Lululemon Athletica Inc, are too distracted to focus on Disney, according to the letter.""Nelson wakes up every day trying to find ways for Trian's investments to generate the best returns,"" the letter said.Peltz has served on 11 public company boards at companies including Procter &amp; Gamble Co. He has said that these companies on average outperformed the broader stock market index during his time as a director on their boards.Disney rebuffed Peltz's request for a board seat last month, arguing he lacks the necessary entertainment and technology skills and experience to help the media company.A shareholder vote to decide on the composition of Disney's board has not yet been set but is expected in the spring.(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Additional reporting by Lisa Richwine;editing by Uttaresh.V)]"

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 8, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis entertainment company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -34.9%.Revenues are expected to be $23.33 billion, up 6.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Disney?For Disney, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.37%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Disney will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Disney would post earnings of $0.50 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.30, delivering a surprise of -40%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Disney doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These agreements, working together, will help Chicago support equitable access to cleaner energy; expand workforce development initiatives, including in under resourced communities; expand clean transportation options; and provide tools that empower Chicago families and businesses to reduce energy use and save money, while enabling ComEd to continue to provide industry-leading service to its customers in Chicago. The agreements also dovetail with ComEd’s proposed multi-year plans designed to support broader economic, equity and environmental goals. Both agreements will extend for a term of 15 years plus the option of a five-year extension and are subject to approval by the Chicago City Council and Boards of ComEd and Exelon.""These agreements, which will work together, are a win-win for Chicago and its residents, as they will help advance the city’s Climate Action Plan and invest in an equitable transition to a cleaner, healthier energy future for Chicago’s families and businesses,"" said Gil Quiniones, CEO of ComEd. ""ComEd greatly values our century-long partnership with the City of Chicago, and we look forward to continuing to provide Chicago and its residents with record-breaking reliability that supports equitable job creation and economic development.""The Energy and Equity Agreement will support the city’s goals of promoting clean energy, cleaner air, and a healthy environment for all Chicago residents and communities by enabling and investing in renewable energy and the electrification of transportation to bring the benefits of new energy technologies to as many people as possible. It provides, among other things, for the creation and funding of a new non-profit entity – the Clean Energy &amp; Equity Collaborative – that will invest up to $120 million in neighborhood clean and equitable energy initiatives, to be paid for by ComEd shareholder – not customer – funds.Story continues""I am proud to announce this nation-leading Franchise Agreement and Energy and Equity Agreement, which will ensure the ongoing reliability of our electricity grid and accelerate an equitable transition to clean, renewable energy in all 77 communities,"" said Mayor Lori Lightfoot. ""This is big win for Chicago, as the agreement includes up to $120 million in ComEd shareholder funds to support local climate action projects, a commitment to train more than 10,000 Chicagoans for careers in the energy sector, and meaningful improvements in coordination and local accountability with the utility.""The agreements offer a variety of environmental, public health and financial benefits, some of which include:Investments to enable cleaner energy resources &amp; combat climate changeTo expand access to renewable energy, ComEd will access state funding to place rooftop solar on up to 200 low-income homes in disadvantaged communities each year, for a total of up to 4,000 homes over the term of the agreement, at no cost to the customer through the Illinois Solar for All program. Participating homes will see an annual reduction in their electric bills and generate clean, green, and environmentally-friendly energy.To support the city’s goal to achieve 100 percent clean renewable energy by 2035, ComEd will leverage its solar-ready site within the Bronzeville Community Microgrid footprint to allow the city to add up to 200kW of solar power to the city-owned renewable energy portfolio.Enhanced job training programsComEd will seek approval from its regulator, the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC), to construct and operate a $32.5 million Clean Energy Training Hub, to be located on Chicago’s West side, to prepare, train and re-skill 10,000 residents for careers at ComEd or other companies supporting the clean energy transition. Future eligible participants will receive tuition assistance and a stipend for wrap-around services like tools, transportation, housing and childcare.Under the agreement, ComEd will also ensure that Chicago residents will comprise 35 percent of future CONSTRUCT Infrastructure Academy classes. Over the last 10 years, CONSTRUCT has provided skills training to help more than 700 diverse participants prepare for careers in the skilled trades – with more than 70 percent of graduates placed into jobs. Additionally, ComEd will offer full scholarships to 10 CONSTRUCT graduates each year for 10 years to attend Dawson Technical Institute’s Overhead Electrical Line Worker training program.Building on its collaboration with Chicago Public Schools (CPS), ComEd will invest $3.2 million in the Chicago Builds program, a two-year off-campus construction training program for CPS juniors and seniors interested in pursuing a career in construction after graduating high school. The funding will support the program’s expansion to a second school on the west side of Chicago.ComEd will also provide 10 trades-related ComEd internships per year for 10 years to Chicago high school students.Local hiring and MWBE commitmentsOver the term of the agreement, each year, 35 percent of new entry-level field trades roles and 20 percent of new customer service roles at ComEd will be filled by Chicago residents from equity investment eligible communities (EIEC) or socio-economically disadvantaged area (SEDA) communities. This would equate to approximately 1,000 jobs over the term of the agreement based on historical ComEd hiring patterns.To support minority and women-owned businesses (MWBE), the agreement sets participation goals for the total contract value for the design, construction and/or rehab of ComEd utility facilities owned by ComEd in Chicago at 32 percent for minority-owned business and 10 percent for women-owned business contracts.The agreement also establishes a framework under which the city can elect to apply a local hiring requirement of 50 percent worker hours from Chicago residents to non-grid work for the Clean Energy Training Hub. For other large projects, the city may elect to apply to non-grid work a local hiring requirement of 20 percent worker hours from Chicago residents.Innovation to strengthen communitiesComEd will seek federal funding to create a Community Resiliency Hub – a first-of-its kind pilot to promote and study new technologies to advance decarbonization. The hubs will explore elements of electric vehicle charging, battery storage, grid infrastructure upgrades, advanced communications network, community partnerships and workforce development, among other topics.Tools to help families and businesses reduce energy use and save moneyComEd will invest $24 million in energy efficiency weatherization strategies that will lead to lower energy usage and lower energy costs for single-family and multi-unit households in under resourced communities. This funding is estimated to aid nearly 4,900 low to median income households; a typical household will save up to $941 each year. Over the life of the weatherization measures, approximately 460 million pounds of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will be avoided.A pilot to provide affordable broadband accessBy leveraging hundreds of miles of its reserve capacity fiber assets, ComEd would enable internet service providers (ISPs) to bring fast, reliable, affordable broadband infrastructure to communities across Chicago that have limited access to high-speed internet. ComEd will work partner with the city to seek applicable federal, state and other sources of funding to advance broadband expansion efforts.Enhanced transparency and coordinationUnder the agreement, a City-ComEd Coordination Council will be created to enhance collaboration and communication to resolve critical infrastructure issues; coordinate electrification and decarbonization activities and investments; pursue federal, state and private funding sources to advance the Energy and Equity Agreement; monitor reliability and affordability data; and coordinate updates to the City Council.A community advisory panel would also be created to provide community feedback and input on the implementation of clean energy and electrification projects. The panel would include representatives from the city and ComEd along with local community, environmental and other stakeholder groups.Superior reliability and valueChicago residents receive superior reliability and value from ComEd, and the agreements will allow ComEd to continue to deliver this outstanding service. ComEd customers today enjoy record-breaking, nation-leading reliability because of prudent and necessary grid investments. Further, ComEd’s average total monthly residential customer bill of $93 is among the lowest in the nation, and approximately 20 percent lower than the average in the 10 largest metropolitan areas. In addition, ComEd’s historical grid investments have enabled ComEd to deliver a variety of programs that have delivered more than $8 billion in savings to customers by enabling them to use less electricity more efficiently.ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 200 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

370,6ca08182-e269-37cb-94cd-8d62478c2a17,UA,2023-02-02,"Following a 33% decline over last year, recent gains may please Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/following-33-decline-over-last-120446041.html,1675339486,STORY,['UAA'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 67% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors would appreciate the 7.8% increase in share prices last week, given their one-year returns have been disappointing at 33%.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Under Armour. Check out our latest analysis for Under Armour ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Under Armour?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Under Armour already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Under Armour's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Under Armour is not owned by hedge funds. From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Kevin Plank (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 15% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.3% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 16 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Under ArmourThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Under Armour, Inc.. Insiders own US$850m worth of shares in the US$5.4b company. That's quite meaningful. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 17% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

372,032699c0-c895-33d2-bc76-2e08ab0a4907,UA,2023-02-02,Analysts Estimate Under Armour (UAA) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-under-armour-uaa-150003496.html,1675263603,STORY,"['UAA', 'DLA']","[Under Armour (UAA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 8, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis sports apparel company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -35.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.55 billion, up 1.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.62% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Under Armour?For Under Armour, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.08%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Under Armour will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Under Armour would post earnings of $0.16 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.20, delivering a surprise of +25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Under Armour doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Textile - Apparel industry, Delta Apparel (DLA) is soon expected to post loss of $0.54 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -205.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $106 million, down 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Delta Apparel has been revised 155.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Delta Apparel will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

JNPR reported mixed fourth-quarter 2022 results with the bottom line matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the top line missing the same. The company witnessed a strong business momentum in the December quarter. The double-digit year-over-year revenue upside was mostly driven by the cloud and enterprise business growth. Despite facing supply chain headwinds, it expects this healthy growth momentum to continue in 2023.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net income in the fourth quarter improved to $180.4 million or 55 cents per share from $132.9 million or 40 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. Double-digit revenue growth fuelled by a solid performance in the cloud and enterprise business resulted in higher net income.Non-GAAP net income was $213.8 million or 65 cents per share compared with $184.7 million or 56 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate.For full-year 2022, GAAP net income stands at $471.0 million or $1.43 per share, significantly higher $252.7 million or 76 cents per share recorded in 2021. A staggering 86% year-over-year increase can be attributed to higher revenues and one-time debt extinguishment costs in 2021.Non-GAAP net income for 2022 rose to $642.6 million or $1.95 per share from $576.2 million or $1.74 per share in 2021.Juniper Networks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Juniper Networks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseJuniper Networks, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Juniper Networks, Inc. Quote RevenuesJuniper’s quarterly revenues increased to $1,448.8 million from $1,299.9 million in the prior-year quarter. High growth in Cloud and Enterprise business boosted top-line performance. However, the company witnessed a year-over-year decline in Service Provider vertical. The top line missed the consensus estimate of $1,482 million. To enhance the end-user experience, JNPR resorts to the first networking strategy focused on AI and cloud-delivered automation that generated higher net sales. Full-year 2022 net sales amounted to $5,301 million, up 12% from the 2021 figure.Product revenues totaled $988.3 million in the reported quarter, up 13% year over year. Compared to the same quarter last year, service revenue climbed to $460.5 million from $425.3 million.By vertical, revenues in cloud increased to $380.3 million from $333.4 million. It was the company’s second-highest cloud revenue quarter. Enterprise business also performed exceptionally well as revenue rose to $599.2 million from $455.1 million. However, revenues from Service Provider declined to $469.3 million from $511.4 million in the year-ago quarter.By region, revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa increased to $378.5 million from $343.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenues in the Americas increased to $857.4 million from $748.6 million. In the Asia Pacific, revenues were up 2.3% to $212.9 million.Story continuesOther DetailsGross profit was $827 million compared with $750.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Total operating expenses increased to $623.5 million from $596.5 million. Operating income was $203.5 million compared with $153.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $276.5 million, up from $238.1 million, with respective margins of 19.1% and 18.3%.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityIn 2022, Juniper generated $97.6 million of cash from operating activities compared with $689.7 million in 2021. The huge difference is primarily due to significantly higher prepaid expenses and deferred income taxes. As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had $880.1 million in cash and cash equivalents with $1,601.3 million of long-term debt vs 2021 figure of $1,686.8 million.OutlookJuniper is experiencing supply chain headwinds induced by shortages and high component and freight costs. Supply chain woes are expected to continue in 2023 as well. The company also anticipates that a normalized software mix and seasonality will likely affect first-quarter gross margin.For the first quarter, the company approximates revenues of $1340 million (+/- $50 million). Non-GAAP gross margin is estimated at 57% (+/- 1%). Juniper expects non-GAAP operating expenses to be $580 million (+/- $5 million). It anticipates the non-GAAP operating margin to be 13.7% at the mid-point of revenue guidance. The non-GAAP tax rate is approximated at 19% ( +/- 1%). Assuming a share count of close to 330 million, non-GAAP net income is anticipated to be 42 cents per share (plus or minus 5 cents).Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderJuniper currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

380,185c327a-9c5a-3dcc-8af0-ff3115fdd7d1,CMCSA,2023-02-02,Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 84% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-corporation-nasdaq-cmcsa-largely-120333817.html,1675339413,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[If you want to know who really controls Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 84% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Comcast. See our latest analysis for Comcast ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Comcast?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Comcast already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Comcast's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Comcast is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.4% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.2% and 7.3% of the stock. Furthermore, CEO Brian Roberts is the owner of 0.8% of the company's shares.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of ComcastThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Comcast Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$1.5b worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Comcast. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 4 warning signs for Comcast that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

They will be the core, right?I think Disney is going to be part of the core. What happens to Peacock and Paramount+ and all of these others, I think, remains to be seen.

This technology can help improve the way health professionals use and share patient information.The new modernization known in Nova Scotia as ""One Person One Record"" (OPOR), is intended to provide clinicians easier access to real-time health information anywhere and allow healthcare workers to spend less time at the computer and more time with their patients.Like much of the world, Nova Scotia has dealt with health care challenges such as emergency department long wait times and provider waitlists. Real-time digital charting in Oracle Cerner's technology at the point of care can help clinicians more quickly and more easily access important patient information including the most recent and historical laboratory data and diagnostic imaging results as they are making decisions on the next steps for care.""The availability of a single information system that supports our care providers in delivering safe, more timely, and connected services should improve the quality of care received by patients and families while making their journeys more seamless,"" said Dr. Krista Jangaard, president and CEO, IWK Health.Health professionals in acute care facilities in Nova Scotia can use a digital closed-loop medication management process to help reduce prescribing errors, ensure allergy information is available, enable electronic prescription verification with pharmacy, and better documentation for auditing. This improvement to patient safety helps providers make sure the right medication is prescribed and given to the right patient, in the right dose, at the right time, and with the right documentation.Story continues""The approval of OPOR is a great day for healthcare in Nova Scotia,"" said Dr. Matthew Clarke, emergency physician, Central Zone. ""This legacy project will help ensure an integrated and standardized healthcare experience regardless of where patients are in the province. As a provider, it will give me immediate access to the information and support I need, so I can focus on providing safe, high-quality care for my patients.""Dr. Christy Bussey, medical executive director and hospitalist, Central Zone, added, ""OPOR will provide the foundation of digitally enabled health care in Nova Scotia. OPOR will connect our clinicians and patients across the province as we have not done before, improving patient safety, access, efficiency, and flow. It will foster health care system transformation and help propel us forward as a magnet for health care providers.""Population health solutions provided by Oracle Cerner will help provide a continued focus on proactive health maintenance. The tools can help the health system know and predict what will happen within a population, engage the person, their family, and the care team to take action, and manage outcomes to improve health and care. Once fully implemented, Cerner's patient portal will be available, allowing Nova Scotians easier access to their own health information and the ability to connect directly with their caregivers.""Hospitals and health systems across the globe are facing many challenges that more intuitive and predictive technology can assist with,"" said Brian Sandager, vice president, Oracle Health, Canada. ""We are excited for this opportunity to help Nova Scotia improve health care across their region. Our work together will help clinicians use a more open, intelligent, interoperable platform to care for the population of Nova Scotia and provide a more holistic approach to health care for patients.""Oracle Cerner has been a trusted partner of Nova Scotia's health system for 30 years, providing laboratory and radiology information systems.

395,82e913c3-94d5-3cd9-9f82-fb47edcdfc29,YUM,2023-02-02,Yum Brands (YUM) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yum-brands-yum-earnings-expected-150003102.html,1675263603,STORY,"['YUMC', 'YUM']","[Yum Brands (YUM) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 8, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis parent company of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.25 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +22.6%.Revenues are expected to be $1.93 billion, up 2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.28% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Yum?For Yum, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.85%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Yum will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Yum would post earnings of $1.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.09, delivering a surprise of -4.39%.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Yum appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsYum China Holdings (YUMC), another stock in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.14 for the quarter ended December 2022.

Of course, you were. Well, maybe you weren't. I don't know. A restaurant posting double digit sales gains with recession fears swirling is no small feat even if you sell value food like McDonald's.The surprising sales strength caught the attention of Soz. He did a little diving into the company's earnings call.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I'm always looking for reasons of things for companies, life, well, you name it. And I went back, and I was just rereading our very own Brooke DiPalma's coverage on McDonald's and also the company's earnings call to try to understand where these blowout sales gains came from.With a lot of pressure on consumer wallets here, I mean, you normally don't see double digit sales gains from McDonald's even considering there is inflation. A couple of things that's-- one thing that stood out to me was the data around digital, McDonald's digital. I was just shocked by some of these numbers here on how fast the digital business is growing from McDonald's, and I think, really playing a key role in driving these double digit sales gains.Fourth quarter, digital represented 35% of system wide sales McDonald's top six markets. That's pretty huge. Last year, the McDonald's app was downloaded over 40 million times in the US. That is absolutely massive. McDonald's also calling out 50 million active loyalty users in our top six markets. And this really reflects McDonald's app just getting better. Where you can, obviously, pay and order and have all of these things delivered. And they're giving you rewards.It is just a good app, and that was not the case a couple of years ago. Underscoring this importance, good quote on the conference call from McDonald's CEO, Chris Kempczinski, saying, digital sales gives us such an unlock to get more tailored in the experience, the offer, products, and we're delivering to our customers. And so I think for us, if we can get there on digital, that's going to be a big opportunity.Story continuesIt looks like that opportunity is, in fact, already starting to play out. And speaking of digital, the company appears to be firing on all cylinders, at least on its earnings day on digital. It was an interesting tweet they put out yesterday from the McDonald's account. That you had Ronald McDonald's being spoken in the same as when you text your ex, and they don't respond. Of course, this has nothing to do with McDonald's digital, but, again, just I think digital top of mind McDonald's. I think that's a pretty creative tweet.One interesting way to use Ronald McDonald. When I grew up, they used them in commercials. And now they're talking about dating and Ronald.- Well, I mean, I think they're trying to keep pace with Wendy's and how well they've done on their social accounts as well.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah.- And then when I think about the digital component that you were mentioning a moment ago, I just immediately think to myself, it's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me. Because at the end of the day, I am the one that's placing so many digital orders. That is the new kind of way that people are saying, you know what? I'm seeing value, but I'm seeing it's still in having the Happy Meal or having those McNuggets delivered via UberEats or just placing an order that way easily and not leaving the comfort of my couch.And so for those deliveries, I'm probably a line item in some of those.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, no one wants to go drive and pick up McNuggets in this day and age. Just order. But here's my take. And just staying on of all things digital here McDonald's. McDonald's app, good, in my humble opinion. Dunkin app, not good, which is unfortunate.Dunkin has made a series of updates, and I'm a big Dunkin guy. I'm constantly ordering from there. But I think the rewards program is still very confusing. It is hard to navigate. I encourage everyone to just if you want to better understand this McDonald's digital story, go into the McDonald's app, try, and play around with it. And go to the Dunkin app.You will see that is a much more slick, easy to use interface from McDonald's perhaps explaining why they're winning a lot of good business. And maybe in terms of coffee, maybe winning some business from Dunkin.- I've spent a lot of time in that Dunkin app, and I think for all of the app comparisons right now, because users are able to compare McDonald's app, you're able to compare a Domino's app even if you wanted to, and then, additionally, you could weave in Starbucks' app. And all of those different experiences, it's so core to the value experience that somebody, a customer, is taking away.And that ease of ordering, I think, is what's so imperative for all of these companies to get right. And then try to upsell within that app experience.- Yeah, I mean I feel like Starbucks and Chipotle are the two that have made it not something that's on the side, not something additional, but just sort of part and parcel of their operations. And so those seem like the models to follow for other companies.]"

Rising prices are also hurting the industry’s traffic. These factors have been affecting margins of late. However, the gradual improvement in demand, menu innovation, robust off-premise sales, sales-building efforts and digital initiatives bode well. Stocks like, McDonald's Corporation MCD, Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM and Darden Restaurants, Inc. DRI are well-poised to counter the scenario.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Retail – Restaurants industry comprises several owners and operators of casual, upscale casual, fine dining, full-service and fast-casual restaurants. Some industry participants operate as roasters, marketers and retailers of specialty coffee. Some companies develop, operate, and franchise quick-service restaurants worldwide. A few restaurant operators offer cooked-to-order dishes, which include noodles and pasta, soups, salads and appetizers. Some industry players develop, own, operate, manage, and license restaurants and lounges worldwide. A few companies also operate technology-enabled Japanese restaurants in the United States and provide Japanese cuisine through a revolving sushi service model.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Restaurant IndustryTraffic Woes &amp; High Costs Linger: The restaurant industry has been facing declining traffic for quite some time now. A rapid increase in menu prices and coronavirus are the primary reasons behind traffic erosion. Restaurant operators are grappling with the high cost of operations. Intense competition, high wages and food cost inflation remain concerns. The industry is persistently bearing increased expenses, which have been affecting margins. Higher pre-opening costs, marketing expenses and costs related to sales-boosting initiatives are exerting pressure the company’s margins. The rise in meat and seafood costs, including ribs, prime rib, ribeye and tri-tip and salmon, is hurting the industry.Sales Declined in December: Per the industry body, the National Restaurant Association (NRA), restaurant sales declined in December to $88.3 billion compared with $89.2 billion generated in November. The association also said that October and November sales were $1.6 billion lower than preliminary numbers reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.Digitalization to Drive Growth: Restaurant operators’ focus on digital innovation, sales-building initiatives and cost-saving efforts has been acting as a catalyst. With the growing influence of the Internet, digital innovation has become the need of the hour. Restaurant operators are constantly partnering with delivery channels and digital platforms to drive incremental sales. Partnerships with delivery channels like DoorDash, Grubhub, Postmates and Uber Eats and the rollout of self-service kiosks and loyalty programs continue to drive growth. Restaurant operators are focusing on driverless delivery systems to augment sales amid the coronavirus crisis. This is anticipated to reduce expenses substantially and ensure safety amid the pandemic as companies do away with delivery personnel.Off-Premise Sales Acting as a Key Catalyst: The industry has been gaining from the increase in off-premise sales, which primarily include delivery, takeout, drive-thru, catering, meal kits, and off-site options such as kiosks and food trucks, owing to the coronavirus pandemic. Per the National Restaurant Association, more than 60% of restaurant foods are consumed off-premise. By 2025, off-premise will likely account for approximately 80% of the industry’s growth. Most restaurant operators have initiated testing of ghost or virtual kitchens. The idea of providing off-premise offerings along with a connected curbside service has been garnering positive customer feedback.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dismal ProspectsThe Zacks Gaming industry is grouped within the broader Retail-Wholesale sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #161, which places it in the bottom 36% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

If you want to see more top performing dividend stocks in January 2023, go directly to 5 Top Performing Dividend Stocks in January 2023.January has been a pretty good month for the S&amp;P 500 as the index is up around 5% year to date as of January 30.One reason for the good performance could be better than expected economic data.In terms of the United States, U.S. GDP expanded by a 2.9% annualized pace in Q4 2022, slightly better than expected.In terms of the world, the IMF said on January 30 it expected the global economy to expand 2.9% in 2023, or a 0.2 percentage point increase from the agency's previous forecast in October. For those of you interested, check out Countries by GDP: 30 Largest Economies in the World.In terms of inflation, it seems to have cooled from its previous 2022 highs given the rise in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks.While the S&amp;P 500 has done well this month, some dividend stocks have done even better with some of the top performing dividend stocks rising more than 13% year to date.In terms of the stocks that have done really well in January, there could be various reasons for their out performance.Some of the top performing dividend stocks in January 2023 are companies that have for various reasons fallen substantially in the past. With the change in market sentiment, their share prices have increased.Other stocks like Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) are arguably value stocks that are likely trading below what it is worth in the long term if macroeconomic conditions normalize. In Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)'s case, it is trading for substantially below price to book value.While the market is currently optimistic that interest rates might not rise as much as previously expected, the Federal Reserve and economic data will ultimately make that decision. If economic data doesn't meet estimates or the Federal Reserve raises rates further than expected, the market and top performing dividend stocks could both decline. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesMethodologyFor our list of 12 Top Performing Dividend Stocks in January 2023, we selected stocks with a market capitalization of over $10 billion that had dividend yields of over 1% as of 1/30 according to Finviz.com.We then filtered the stocks to ensure they exceeded the S&amp;P 500's January performance of 5% by a wide margin.12 Top Performing Dividend Stocks in January 202312. Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD)Year to Date Performance as of 1/30: 13.36%Dividend Yield as of 1/30: 2.47%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) is an industrial REIT that declined around 16% in the last year given the rise in interest rates. Not only is the cost of new debt higher with higher interest rates, but also REIT dividend yields are less attractive if Treasury yields are higher. With inflation showing signs of potentially peaking, however, some investors have rotated back into leading REITs like Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) in January in anticipation of an eventual renormalization of interest rates. When interest rates will normalize is up for debate as many think it could be at least several years.Alongside InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (NYSE:IHG), Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF), and Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) is a top performing dividend stock in January 2023.11. Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR)Year to Date Performance as of 1/30: 13.83%Dividend Yield as of 1/30: 3.51%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) is a healthcare REIT that is close to flat in terms of its performance in the last year. Like many other REITs, Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) shares weakened in middle to late 2022 given the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases which made REIT dividend yields less attractive, all else equal. In recent months, however, Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) shares have bounced back with the REIT up nearly 14% in January as of 1/30 as many leading sector names have also done well.10. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Year to Date Performance as of 1/30: 14.42%Dividend Yield as of 1/30: 3.94%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is one of the big four American banks that's trading for substantially below its book value. According to the bank, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) ended 2022 with tangible book value per share of $81.65 and book value per share of $94.06. Over the course of 2022, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) returned $7 billion back to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, which given the stock's current market capitalization of around $100 billion indicates a capital return of around 7%. Although the bank might not trade for its book value any time soon, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) stock could potentially narrow the gap between its stock price and its book value in the long term given share repurchases and if it increases its earnings.9. State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT)Year to Date Performance as of 1/30: 16.22%Dividend Yield as of 1/30: 2.80%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) is a leading asset management company whose stock has more than doubled from 2012. Although shares are down around 2.5% in the last year, State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) stock has rallied 16.22% in January as of 1/30 as capital has rotated back into many leading financial names. State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) also has a dividend yield of 2.80% which is pretty decent combined with the company's long term growth potential if it maintains its market share.8. KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR)Year to Date Performance as of 1/30: 17.26%Dividend Yield as of 1/30: 1.14%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR) is a leading asset management firm whose stock has surged 17.26% year to date as of 1/30, ranking #8 on our list of 12 Top Performing Dividend Stocks in January 2023. Capital could be rotating back into leading alternative asset managers in anticipation that the peak interest rates might not be as high as previously expected given the cooling inflation data. If interest rates don't rise as much as expected, KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR)'s earnings power could potentially increase with less cost of debt to finance purchases or new growth projects.7. The Carlyle Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CG)Year to Date Performance as of 1/30: 17.83%Dividend Yield as of 1/30: 3.48%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30The Carlyle Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CG) is another leading asset management firm whose stock has done well in January. As of 1/30, The Carlyle Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CG) shares have increased by 17.83%, around the same as its peer, KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR). If the economy doesn't weaken as much as expected, The Carlyle Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CG)'s AUM could potentially increase faster than expected and its earnings power could be stronger than expected as well.6. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)Year to Date Performance as of 1/30: 17.89%Dividend Yield as of 1/30: 1.80%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Although it isn't anywhere the size of its once peer Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), internet retailer eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)'s stock has surged by nearly 18% in January as other leading tech stocks have also rebounded thanks to improved sentiment. In the long term, eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)'s stock has still more than doubled from its 2013 levels. Unlike some other leading tech names, eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) also has a pretty decent dividend yield of 1.80% as of 1/30. At the end of Q3, 42 hedge funds in our database of 920 funds held shares in eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY).Like eBay Inc.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over PACCAR's (NASDAQ:PCAR) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for PACCAR, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$3.7b ÷ (US$33b - US$7.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, PACCAR has an ROCE of 14%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Machinery industry average of 11% it's much better. View our latest analysis for PACCAR roceIn the above chart we have measured PACCAR's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is PACCAR's ROCE Trending?While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 14% and the business has deployed 53% more capital into its operations. Since 14% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.The Bottom Line On PACCAR's ROCETo sum it up, PACCAR has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 103% return they've received over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.Story continuesPACCAR does come with some risks though, we found 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is concerning...While PACCAR isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

405,0cecd974-f92f-38b7-bc09-0af362c35573,PCAR,2023-02-02,7 Industrial Stocks That Will Be Big Winners,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-industrial-stocks-big-winners-203759511.html,1675024679,STORY,"['UPS', 'LMT', 'PCAR', 'UNP', 'DOV', 'CLF']","[On the surface, it may seem as if now’s not the time to buy industrial stocks. With macro issues still unresolved, and the threat of a 2023 global recession still looming, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the near-term operational performance of companies in the industrial sector.However, that uncertainty is not a reason to sit on the sidelines. For starters, for some stocks, high uncertainty equals favorable opportunity. That is, there are plenty of cyclical industrials still trading at heavily discounted valuations, as their prospects remain murky. Some stocks in this category have become overly discounted, creating a favorable risk/reward proposition.In other cases, there are industrial names currently benefiting from more positive trends. For example, companies with exposure to recent geopolitical conflicts, as well as companies with exposure to secular growth trends. Between these two categories, there are plenty of industrial stocks worth buying in today’s market, including these seven. All of them are reasonably-priced, and have catalysts that could each one to “crush it” in the years ahead.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCLFCleveland-Cliffs$21.62DOVDover$144.98LMTLockheed Martin$459.60PCARPACCAR$110.63SQMSociedad Química y Minera de Chile$94.61UNPUnion Pacific$202.39UPSUnited Parcel Service$182.09Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comCleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) has traded wildly over the past twelve months. Skyrocketing on the heels of the commodities supply shock caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine early last year, this steel stock gave back most of its gains (and then some), thanks to poor quarterly results.However, investors have responded favorably to the company’s recent price hikes for steel products. As the company supplies steel based on fixed price contracts, these price increases point to higher profitability going forward. Although analyst forecasts call for Cleveland-Cliffs to earn just $1.99 per share this year, and $2.26 per share in 2024, increased steel prices, plus a rebound in automotive demand, could mean much better-than-expected results. On a longer timeframe, as InvestorPlace’s Larry Ramer recently argued, the forthcoming infrastructure spending boom could provide a further boost for the CLF stock price.Story continuesDover (DOV)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comDover (NYSE:DOV) may be best known for its “dividend king” status. This industrial conglomerate has increased its dividend payouts an impressive 66 years in a row. Yet besides its steady, growing quarterly payouts (current forward yield of 1.41%), there’s another reason why DOV is one of the best industrial stocks to buy.Trading for 17.8 times earnings, DOV stock trades at a discount to industrial conglomerate peers like Danaher (NYSE:DHR) and Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW), which trade for 27.6 and 26.1 times earnings, respectively. Sure, one may argue this is due to low expected earnings growth for DOV. Yet while earnings growth is expected to slow in 2023, analyst forecasts call for around 9.3% earnings growth in 2024. A resumption of earnings growth, plus a modest amount of multiple expansion, could mean strong price appreciation for DOV in the years ahead.Lockheed Martin (LMT)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chartSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comOutperforming the market in 2022, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) continues to perform well. With geopolitical uncertainty serving as a tailwind, the LMT stock could continue to stay strong, as the company continues to report solid results. As seen in recent headlines, Lockheed Martin continues to secure big-ticket contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, such a recent $656.77 million contract win by its Sikorsky aircraft unit.Alongside the prospect of steady results, LMT remains appealing thanks to its dividend policy. Raising its payout annually over the past twenty years, the company recently raised it again, to $3 per share quarterly. This gives LMT stock a forward yield of 2.61%.PACCAR (PCAR)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comOver the last few months, shares of Paccar (NASDAQ:PCAR) have been recovering nicely. That’s not surprising, given that this commercial truck manufacturer continues to beat expectations with its quarterly results, despite the overhanging fears of an economic slowdown, which in theory could impact demand for its products. Admittedly, some analysts are hesitant about PCAR stock, after its hot run over the past few months. For instance, analysts at Credit Suisse earlier this month stressed that Paccar’s rally may not be sustainable, as economic challenges could start to affect results in 2023.However, with shares trading for just 13 times earnings, even as shares have surged, the risk of an earnings slowdown could still be accounted-for in its valuation. Don’t forget, either, that Paccar has “green wave” catalysts as well. The company is working on the technology necessary to make battery electric and hydrogen-powered versions of its semi-trucks.Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comSociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) may not be a household name in the United States, but plenty of American investors have caught onto the opportunity with the U.S.-listed shares of this Chilean-based industrial company. That’s mostly, due to its high exposure to the lithium boom. Better, with lithium demand expected to climb with the electric vehicle boom, this leading miner of lithium is poised to continue experiencing strong growth for years to come.With this, SQM stock isn’t only one of the top industrial stocks out there. As Louis Navellier put it earlier this month, it’s also one of the best large-cap stocks to buy for the long haul. Besides the long growth runway, other factors that make this stock a strong buy-and-hold opportunity are its low earnings multiple (8.7), and its high dividend yield (9.51%).Union Pacific (UNP)Source: ShutterstockAmong stocks in the industrial sector, railroads may be some of the most appealing out there. There are several large publicly-traded U.S. Class 1 railroads out there you can buy, but Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) in particular stands out, namely for the two ways it is returning capital to shareholders. Why? First, UNP stock offers a slightly-higher dividend compared to peers like CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC). UNP’s forward yield currently comes in at 2.58%, versus 1.33% for CSX, and 2.24% for NSC.Second, UNP is aggressively buying back shares. Last year, it initiated a new share repurchase program. Through 2025, the company is authorized by its board to repurchase up to 100 million shares. Given this railroad has 642.88 million shares outstanding, this could have a tremendous impact on earnings per share (or EPS), and UNP’s stock price.United Parcel Service (UPS)white keyboard with ""buy"" written on a green enter key (stocks to buy)Source: ShutterstockTo cap off this list of top industrial stocks, let’s look at another high-profile transportation stock: United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). The current economic slowdown has had an impact on the performance of shares in this package transportation company.Surging during 2020 and 2021, as the pandemic’s “stay at home economy” boosted results, UPS stock has moved lower since 2022, when pandemic headwinds dissipated, and macro headwinds emerged. That said, as I argued earlier this month, this uncertainty has pushed shares to a low valuation.At today’s prices, UPS trades for only 14.1 times earnings. For most of the past ten years, this top transportation stock has traded for between 15 and 20 times earnings. As the economy normalizes in 2023 and 2024, United Parcel Service could revert back to this historic valuation. Alongside a low earnings multiple, UPS sports a moderately-high dividend yield of 3.38%.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

Rowe Price, the long-term success of our clients is made possible by the diversity of backgrounds, perspectives, talents, and experiences of our associates. Through our diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs; community partnerships; and the work of the T. Rowe Price Foundation, we continuously invest in people and communities.As we celebrate Black History Month, we lift the contributions and impact of the community and commit to continuing doing the work to strengthen the community, culture, and broader world.Supporting Our AssociatesOur Diversity Talent Acquisition team is developing a pipeline of underrepresented talent for roles at all levels within the firm. Our recruitment efforts include M.B.A. Weekends, Female Insight Days, investment fellowships, and our pre-M.B.A. summer internships for students of diverse backgrounds. We also created programs to introduce talent to our firm and culture. For example, our Launching Your Legacy program is an opportunity for diverse undergraduate talent to gain exposure to careers in asset management and career pathways at T. Rowe Price, including in Investments, Distribution (Sales and Marketing), Finance and Accounting, Investment Operations, and Technology.The MOSAIC @ T. Rowe Price business resource group is an associate-led group made up of individuals who join based on common interests; similar lived experiences; and backgrounds or demographic factors such as gender, race, or ethnicity. Through MOSAIC's subgroups-the African Heritage Community, the Asian Heritage Community, and LatinX Heritage Community-the group proactively celebrates cultural diversity and coordinates panel discussions across the firm with senior leaders for all associates to learn from and understand how to progress their careers. This February, the African Heritage Community is promoting health equality and career development, hosting an educational session on sickle cell anemia, two blood drives, and a fireside chat promoting internal professional development resources available to associates.Story continuesThe firm's Black Leadership Council (BLC) promotes opportunities and success for Black/African American associates. This advisory group provides a direct channel of communication between the Management Committee and senior Black associates to ensure there is active dialogue on associate attraction, retention, and development, as well as timely social issues. Acting as mentors of the firm's rising Black talent, BLC members support the firm's community engagement and outreach and advise the firm's leadership in communicating important messages and developments related to the firm's DEI initiatives.Supporting Our CommunitiesStrategic partnerships with diverse organizations are key in helping us to further engage with diverse talent of all backgrounds. For many years, we have partnered with the Robert Toigo Foundation-an M.B.A. fellowship program that develops minority professionals who are ready to lead within the finance industry-which has helped us attract several diverse associates. We have similar relationships with the BEYA (Black Engineer of the Year) STEM Community and the National Society of Black Engineers, among others, and we continue to evaluate other partnerships to source diverse talent.We also partner with several industry organizations, including the Money Management Institute, the Association of African American Financial Advisors, the CFA Institute, and the UK's Diversity Project to create equal access and opportunity within the industry. Further, Raymone Jackson, the global head of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion participates on roundtables with other diversity leaders within the industry to share best practices and scale efforts for broader impact.To that end, last year T. Rowe Price joined the Equity Collective, an industry-leading group of wealth management and asset management businesses that have come together to educate, empower, and develop the next generation of diverse leaders in the finance industry.We also support diverse-owned social good businesses, innovators, and entrepreneurs of color through Moonshot, a program the T. Rowe Price Group launched in 2022 with Baltimore Corps, a local nonprofit focused on creating equitable change. Eight Moonshot Innovators-four nonprofit organizations and four for-profit startups-received a financial reward from T. Rowe Price and were paired with pro bono volunteer advisors from the firm who partnered with each innovator on a specific business challenge.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in United Parcel Service's (NYSE:UPS) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on United Parcel Service is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.29 = US$15b ÷ (US$71b - US$18b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, United Parcel Service has an ROCE of 29%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Logistics industry average of 12%. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service roceIn the above chart we have measured United Parcel Service's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for United Parcel Service.The Trend Of ROCEInvestors would be pleased with what's happening at United Parcel Service. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 29%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 62%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at United Parcel Service thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.Our Take On United Parcel Service's ROCEA company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what United Parcel Service has. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 97% return over the last five years. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Story continuesIf you'd like to know more about United Parcel Service, we've spotted   2 warning signs,  and 1 of them shouldn't be ignored.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:UPS) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript January 31, 2023Operator: Good morning. My name is Stephen and I will be your facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And the after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. . It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Ken Cook, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours.Ken Cook: Good morning, and welcome to the UPS fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; Brian Newman, our CFO; and a few additional members of our executive leadership team. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within The Federal Securities Laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2021 Form 10-K, subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and other reports we file with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC.Unless stated otherwise, our discussion refers to adjusted results. For the third quarter of 2022, GAAP results include a non-cash after-tax mark-to-market pension gains of $782 million, a onetime non-cash after tax charge of $384 million resulting from accelerated vesting of restricted performance units in connection with the change in incentive compensation program design, a non-cash after tax charge of $58 million from a reduction in the residual value of our MD11 aircraft and after tax transformation and other charges of $41 million. The after tax total for these items is $299 million, a benefit to fourth quarter 2022 EPS of $0.34 per diluted share. Additional details regarding your pension adjustments are included in the Appendix of our fourth quarter 2022 earnings presentation that will be posted to the UPS Investor Relations website later today.Story continuesA reconciliation to GAAP financial results is available on the UPS Investor Relations website, along with the webcast of today's call. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions from those joining us via the teleconference. . And now I'll turn the call over to Carol.Carol Tome : Thank you, Ken. And good morning. Let me begin by thanking UPSers for delivering what matters to our customers this holiday season. In a quarter, we were faced with choppy demand, continued COVID lockdowns in China, a threat of a work strike in the United States, and a bomb cyclone in North America. But no matter what came our way, our team delivered. We executed another outstanding peak and delivered industry leading service for the fifth consecutive year. I'm very proud of our team and what we accomplished, not just in the quarter, but for the entire year. Looking at our fourth quarter results, we expected volume levels to decline from last year and they did, but more than we planned due to macro conditions that Brian will discuss.We responded by managing our network with agility and a focus on service. Consolidated revenue was $27 billion, down 2.7% from last year, and operating profit was $3.8 billion, a decrease of 3.3%. While our consolidated operating margin declined by 10 basis points from last year, to 14.1%, our U.S. operating margin expanded to 12.8% and reached the levels not seen in 10 year. Reflecting back on 2022, much changed from when we originally set our plan. We experienced geopolitical tensions, including a war and global inflation drove food and energy costs higher. We saw both relief and concern as China pivoted away from its zero COVID policy. Global supply chains continue to adjust and demand and pricing for air and ocean freight softened accordingly.Consumers returned to pre-pandemic shopping behaviors, as retailers have been successful and attracting consumers back into stores. And we won't even talk about the weather, which candidly presented challenges throughout the year. Even in the face of so much change, UPSers remained focus on controlling what we can control. And we delivered our full year consolidated operating margins and return on invested capital targets. In 2022, consolidated revenue increased 3.1% to reach $100.3 billion. We missed our revenue target by about 2%, but as Brian will detail, nearly all of this mess was due to a stronger dollar than originally anticipated. Consolidated operating profit in 2022 totaled $13.9 million, 5.4% higher than last year, and consolidated operating margin reached 13.8%.We generated $9 billion in free cash flow and diluted earnings per share were $12.94, an increase of 6.7%. During the year, we stayed on strategy, customer first, people-led, innovation-driven. As we've discussed, customer first is about creating a frictionless customer experience targeted at certain customer segments including SMBs and healthcare. Since its inception, we've had huge success with DAP, our Digital Access Program and making it easier for SMB customers to do business with UPS. In 2022, we generated more than $2.3 billion in DAP revenue exceeding our targets. We expect the momentum to continue and plan to generate around $3 billion in global DAP revenue in 2023. And with the launch of Deal Manager in 2022, we've made progress towards dynamic pricing.Deal Manager digitizes the pricing process, and applies pricing science to present the right offer to our SMB customers the first time, so we are able to close deals faster and with better revenue quality. In 2022, our U.S. win rate with Deal Manager was 22 percentage points higher than the baseline. So we are moving quickly to expand access to Deal Manager to more than 40 countries in 2023. Additionally, we recently launched a pilot that enables systematic day or week pricing, which is good for our customers and good for UPS. Early feedback is promising, and we'll share more updates on this Pilot on future calls. Looking at SMBs, they made up 28% of our total U.S. volume in 2022, an increase of 120 basis points compared to 2021. Turning to healthcare, in 2022, our healthcare portfolio reached $9.2 billion in revenue, and the quality of our offerings was best-in-class.Our goal is to become the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world. Today, we have nearly 17 million square feet of healthcare compliance distribution space globally, with leading cold chain logistics capabilities. In 2023, we expect our healthcare portfolio to generate more than $10 billion in revenue. We don't just look at volume and revenue to measure our success. We also look at our net promoter score. In 2022, the improvements we saw and our net promoter score outpaced the competition. We made strong gains and all 16-customer journeys, including the three most important, negotiate value, reroute a package and resolve a claim. We are well on our way to our NPS target of 50. Turning to People-led. Here we are focused on the employee experience, and making UPS a great place to work.For our frontline employees, we made organizational design changes to address certain work-life balance challenges. We've stepped up maintenance spending in our buildings, including updating break rooms and restrooms, refreshing paints, improving lighting, and adding cooling stations. And for our management employees, nearly 40,000 around the world, we've been laser focused on improving our likelihood to recommend score, or LTR. When I started with the company LTR stood at 51%. It is now 60%, and we would like it to be 80% or higher. And looking at the drivers of dissatisfaction, the largest area of concern was pay, not the total amount of pay, but rather than pay mix structure. So we've taken action to fix it. Beginning in 2023, we are changing the pay mix structure by increasing the cash component.This shift does not change total compensation for our management employees, but does increase cash. We also accelerated the vesting of stock rewards associated with our annual bonus plan. This was a onetime non-cash charge. Beginning in 2023, management incentive plan annual bonuses is earned will be paid in cash. Regarding our upcoming labor contract negotiations, we are well prepared for negotiations, and are focused on achieving an agreement that is a win for our employees, a win for the Teamsters and a win for UPS and our customers. We have great jobs with industry leading pay and benefits. Now I suspect many of you listening today, we'd like to tell about our negotiating strategy. Well, we believe the best way to achieve a win win win outcome is for us leave the details of the negotiations at the bargaining table.So let's move on to the last leg of our strategy, innovation-driven. We believe innovation is one reason we've been able to provide our customers with industry-leading service for five peaks in a row. By leveraging the agility and efficiency of our integrated network, our engineers and operating teams quickly make decisions to adjust the network and keep service levels high. This year, we supplemented our engineering tools with our total service plan, which further improved our on-time network and drove productivity. In the fourth quarter hours deployed in the U.S. dropped 5.3% which was greater than a decrease in volume. And in terms of cube utilization, our efforts in the fourth quarter enabled us to eliminate nearly 1,500 trailer loads per day.We are relentlessly focused on making our network even more efficient. We were very pleased with the initial results of our Smart Package Smart Facility RFID Initiative, where we are seeing fewer missed loads and higher productivity. As a result, this year, we plan to complete the RFID deployment in the more than 900 remaining buildings across the U.S. In 2022, we created a new growth platform we call logistics-as-a-service, which combines digital capabilities with our best-in-class global integrated network. Under this platform, we launched our Delivery Density Solution, where we continue to add customers and are seeing positive results. Lastly, we can't talk about innovation without speaking into the progress we are making against our environmental sustainability targets.In 2022, we took delivery of over 2,300 alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicle, bringing our rolling laboratory to more than 15,600. And in 2023, we plan to add more than 2,400 vehicles, as we move toward carbon neutrality by 2050. We think the best way to measure innovation driven is by delivering higher returns on invested capital. For the full year 2022, we delivered a return on invested capital of 31.3%, 50 basis points above 2021. Let me close with a few comments related to 2023. The outlook for economic growth is cloudy at best, geopolitical tensions are rising, and we have a labor contract to negotiate. For us, it is a year of resilience. What does resilience mean? It means we will plan conservatively and pivot quickly. It means we will balance defensive and offensive mode and it means we will execute what we call our wildly important initiatives.Specifically, we will balance efficiency moves with growth opportunities. Think of that as better and bolder. We will stop certain initiatives and accelerate other thereby increasing investment in our business. Relative to 2022, we are increasing our 2023 expense and capital budget by over $900 million. Finally, we will focus on three widely important initiatives, improving the customer value proposition, increasing talent development and employee engagement, and leveraging our physical network with our digital platform to drive logistics-as-a-service. Given the uncertainty ahead, we are providing a range for our 2023 revenue and profit outlook. Brian will provide the details. As a demonstration of competence in our business going forward, and in concert with our capital allocation principles, the UPS board has approved a $0.10 increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.52 per share to $1.62 per share.This is the 14th consecutive year, we have increased the UPS dividend. Additionally, our board approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization replacing our existing authorization. In closing, for the past two and a half years, we have fundamentally improved nearly every aspect of our business, and we're just getting started. Uncertainty creates opportunity, and this team has proven that it's up for the challenge. So thank you for listening. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.Delivery, Shipment, PackagePhoto by Claudio Schwarz on UnsplashBrian Newman: Thanks, Carol and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover three areas, starting with our fourth quarter results. Then I'll review our full year 2022 results including cash and shareholder returns. And lastly, I'll provide comments on expectations for the macro environment and our financial outlook for 2023. In the fourth quarter, the macro environment was challenging. In the U.S. inflation-sensitive consumers returned to more pre pandemic shopping patterns and holiday retail sales were lower than expected, especially after Cyber week. Internationally, demand in Europe remained under pressure. Ocean and air freight rates declined and exports out of Asia worsened due to COVID conditions in China. Despite these conditions in the fourth quarter, we responded quickly and again delivered for our customers and shareholders.In the fourth quarter. Consolidated revenue was $27 billion, down 2.7% from the fourth quarter of last year, and operating profit was $3.8 billion, a decrease of 3.3% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Consolidated operating margin was 14.1% for the quarter, down 10 basis points from the same time period last year. For the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share was $3.62, up 0.8% from the same period last year. Now let's look at our business segments. In U.S. domestic, revenue quality initiatives more than offset the decline in volume and drove strong fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter, average daily volume was down 3.8% versus the same time period last year, with about half of the decrease coming from our largest customer, per the mutually beneficial contractual agreement we reached some time ago.In the fourth quarter, volume in October and November came in as we expected, including a surge in late-November from Black Friday through Cyber week. In December, volume fell short of our expectations, reflecting consumer spending cutbacks at the height of the holiday season. B2C average daily volume declined 3% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. B2B average daily volume in the fourth quarter was down 5.2% year-over-year, driven by declines in retail and industry sectors that are more sensitive to rising interest rates, like manufacturing and distribution. In the fourth quarter, B2B represented 35.3% of our volume, which was down slightly from 35.8% in the same time period last year. Looking at customer mix, SMBs made up 26.5% of our total U.S. domestic volume in the fourth quarter, an increase of 70 basis points from one year ago, and the 10th consecutive quarter of increased SMB penetration.For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $18.3 billion, up 3.1%. Revenue per piece increased 7.2% driven by revenue quality, which more than offset the decline in volume. Improvements in base pricing more than offset a small decline due to product mix and together drove about half of the revenue per piece growth rate increase. The remaining half of the revenue per piece growth rate increase was driven by the combination of higher fuel price per gallon and our fuel pricing actions. Turning to costs, total expense grew 2.5%. First, higher fuel costs contributed about 150 basis points of the total expense growth rate increase. Second, higher wages and benefit expense contributed 150 basis points of the increase. Total union wage rates were up 5.6% in the fourth quarter, driven by the annual wage increase and cost of living adjustment for our Teamster employees that went into effect in August of 2022.Productivity initiatives help partially offset the increase in expense. For example, total service plan has improved driver dispatch time by 7.9% since its launch in July 2022. This is helping us run an on-time network. And in the fourth quarter we increased total productivity by 1.6% as defined by pieces per hour. Lower purchase transportation expenditures reduced the total expense growth rate by around 140 basis points, primarily from utilizing UPS feeder drivers to support our fastest ground ever and continued optimization efforts. And the remaining expense growth rate increase was driven by multiple factors including maintenance and depreciation. Looking specifically at our peak period, our sales, engineering and operating teams planned and executed another successful peak.We used our technology to maximize the agility of our integrated network, including our newest regional hub in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. All of which enabled us to respond to changes in volume levels and difficult weather as winter storms rolled across the country close to Christmas. Our network never stopped and we provided industry leading service to our customers for the fifth year in a row. The U.S. domestic segment delivered $2.3 billion in operating profit, up 7.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. And operating margin was 12.8% year-over-year increase of 60 basis points. Moving to our international segment. The macro environment was challenging and resulted in lower volume than we anticipated in the fourth quarter. We leveraged the agility of our global network to quickly adjust capacity while delivering excellent service to customers.In the fourth quarter, international average daily volume was down 8.6%. The decline was primarily driven by a 12.9% decrease in domestic average daily volume and weakness out of Asia due to COVID. Total export average daily volume in the fourth quarter declined 4% on a year-over-year basis. Asia export average daily volume declined 10.3% driven by lower global demand and disruptions to manufacturing output from the changes in China's COVID policy. In response, we quickly adjusted the network and cancelled over 200 of our China and Hong Kong origin flights maintained high service levels and achieved a payload utilization of over 98% on our Asia outbound intercontinental flights. In the fourth quarter, international revenue was $5 billion, down 8.3% from last year, due to the decline in volume and a $321 million negative impact currency.Revenue per piece was relatively flat year-over-year, but there were a number of moving parts including a 660 basis point decline due to a stronger U.S. dollar, a 540 basis point increase from fuel surcharges and the remaining increase of 100 basis points was due to the combination of multiple factors including favorable product mix, base price increases and lower demand related surcharge revenue. Operating profit in the international segment was $1.1 billion, down $240 million from last year due to $139 million reduction in demand related surcharge revenue and a $98 million negative impact from currency. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 22%. Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions, in the fourth quarter revenue was $3.8 billion, down $846 million year-over-year.Looking at the key drivers in forwarding, software global demand drove down volume and market rates more than we expected, resulting in lower revenue and operating profit. Logistics partially offset the declines in forwarding and delivered double digit revenue in operating profit growth driven by gains in our complex healthcare business from coaching and clinical trials customers. In the fourth quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated an operating profit of $403 million and operating margin was 10.5%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $182 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $297 million. And our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.4%. Now let me comment on our full year 2022 results.In 2022, we remained focused on controlling what we could control and provided excellent service to our customers, which enabled us to deliver our consolidated operating margin and return on invested capital targets. A few consolidated highlights. Revenue reached $100.3 billion, an increase of $3.1 billion over 2021. This was $1.7 billion below our $102 billion revenue target, but included a $1.3 billion year-over-year negative impact from currency. In 2022, we generated operating profit of $13.9 billion, an increase of 5.4% over full year 2021 consolidated operating margin was 13.8%, an increase of 30 basis points. We increased our ROIC to 31.3%, up 50 basis points compared to last year. We generated $14.1 billion in cash from operations and continue to follow our capital allocation priorities.We invested $4.8 billion in CapEx. Additionally, we acquired Bomi Group, a delivery solutions and made an investment in Commerce Hub. We distributed $5.1 billion in dividends, which represented a 49% increase on a per share basis over 2021. We've repaid $2 billion in debt that matured during the year and our net pension liability decreased by over $3 billion. Both of which helped us reach our targeted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.4 turns, giving us ample financial flexibility to continue deploying capital to create value for our shareholders. Lastly, we completed $3.5 billion in share buybacks in 2022. And in the segments for the full year, a U.S. domestic operating profit was $7.6 billion up 12.8% and we expanded operating margin to 11.8%, a year-over-year increase of 70 basis points.The International segment generated $4.4 billion in operating profit and operating margin was 22.4%. And Supply Chain Solutions delivered operating profit of $1.9 billion, an increase of $153 million and operating margin was 11.3% an increase of 150 basis points over 2021. Moving to our outlook for 2023. We expect 2023 to be a bumpy year, due to rising interest rates, decades high inflation, recession forecasts, a war in Eastern Europe, COVID disruptions in China, and our U.S. labor negotiations. While we anchor our plans to S&amp;P Global economic forecasts, we have developed multiple plans scenarios that will help us quickly pivot in an uncertain macro environment. Further, given our financial strength and solid cash position, we are increasing strategic investments to enhance our ability to capture growth opportunities, as we come out of this cycle.I'd like to share two of those scenarios with you now, which are the basis for the guidance we are providing this year. The first is our base case that delivers the high end of the target range. And the second scenario includes additional top-line risks and represents the low end of the range. Let's start with our assumptions for the base case at a segment level. In the U.S., we expect a mild recession in the first half the year, with a moderate recovery in the second half of the year. In the U.S. domestic segment, we anticipate average daily volume will be down slightly due to our continued volume glide down from our contractual agreements with our largest customer which will be nearly offset with growth from SMB and other enterprise customers.And we expect volume growth to be better in the second half of the year compared to the first. We also expect the revenue growth rate to be low-single digits. On the cost side. While we will manage the network to match volume levels, we have increased both capital and operating expenses for projects that drive efficiency and growth. One example is the accelerated deployment of our smart package smart facility initiative to all remaining U.S. facilities, which we plan to complete by the end of the year. And on the growth front, we will continue to invest in improving customer experience. Putting it all together, we expect to grow revenue per piece at a faster rate than cost per piece, and expand full year domestic operating margins to 12%. Turning to international in 2023.In our base case plan, we expect a recession in Europe in the first half of the year. And in China, we expect weak demand in the first quarter with recovery beginning in the second quarter. We are accelerating initiatives like international data to help us gain share and partially offset macroeconomic softness. We anticipate international average daily volume will decline by low-single digit, with volume growth better in the second half of the year compared to the first. We expect revenue to decline by low-single digits, including reduction in demand related surcharges. We will continue to manage our costs with agility and expect to generate an operating margin of around 21%. Turning to Supply Chain Solutions, we expect revenue to be around $14.6 billion as forwarding volumes will remain challenged and market rates will fall from year-end 2022 levels.We expect to partially offset declines in forwarding revenue from double digit growth in our healthcare business, resulting in an operating margin of nearly 11%. In our downside plan, which represents the low end of our range, we start with our base case assumptions for all segments and layer in the following. In U.S. domestic, we reduced expected enterprise and SMB volume growth rates, resulting in a full year volume decline of around 3% versus 2022. In international, we layer in weaker demand out of Asia for the entire first half of the year, and a slower recovery in Europe in the second half of the year, resulting in a mid-single digit decline in average daily volume. And in Supply Chain Solutions, we lowered our assumptions for air and ocean freight forwarding market volume and rates, which reduced full year revenue for supply chain solutions by around $200 million.Bringing it all together for the full year 2023, we expect consolidated revenues to be between $97 billion and $99.4 billion and consolidated operating margins to be between 12.8% and 13.6%, with more than half of our operating profit coming in the second half of the year. Now turning to pension. There are a couple of factors to keep in mind as you update your models. First, beginning in 2023, we froze our defined benefit pension plan for U.S. non-union employees and have replaced it with enhanced 401(k) benefits. Second, high discount rates at the end of 2022 will result in lower service costs in 2023. Above the line, we expect the combination of these two factors will reduce operating expenses by approximately $420 million in 2023, with around 90% of the reduction in the U.S. domestic segments.Below the line, we expect pension income of around $260 million for the full year 2023, which is $930 million less than in 2022 primarily due to higher interest rates, resulting in an increase in pension interest expense and a reduction in the value of our pension assets for market performance in 2022. We've included a few slides in the Appendix of today's webcast deck to provide you more detail. The webcast deck will be posted to the UPS Investor Relations website following this call. Now let's turn to full year 2023 capital allocation. Our capital priorities have not changed and we will continue to make the best long-term investment decisions that will keep us on strategy and enable us to strengthen our customer value proposition and capture growth coming out of this cycle.We expect 2023 capital expenditures to be about $5.3 billion. And here are a few project highlights. We will invest $2.4 billion in buildings and facilities to add automated storage capabilities and increase efficiency across the network. And we'll add 2.4 million square feet of healthcare logistics space to our global network. We will invest $1.3 billion in vehicles, including adding more than 2,400 alternative fuel vehicles to our fleet. We will invest $745 million in our air fleet, including taking delivery of seven 767 aircraft in 2023. And in terms of IT, we will invest $830 million, which includes accelerating the rollout of smart package smart facility in the U.S., continuing to develop our delivery density solutions, and building out our logistics-as-a-service platform.And lastly, across these projects, and others, over $1 billion of investment will support our carbon neutral goals. Now, let's turn to our expectations for cash and the balance sheet. We expect free cash flow to be around $8 billion in our base case. Consistent with our policy of a stable and growing dividend, the board has approved a dividend per share of $1.62 for the first quarter, which represents a 6.6% increase in our dividend. We are planning to payout around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2023 subject to board approval. We plan to buy back around $3 billion of our shares. And finally, our effective tax rate is expected to be around 23.5%, with a tax rate higher in the first quarter compared to the rest of the year, due to the timing of our employee stock awards.In closing, we are focused on controlling what we can control, but we will continue to invest in our business to balance efficiency and growth opportunities under our better and bolder framework. The fundamental changes we made to our business, coupled with the continued execution of our strategy will help us navigate what's ahead in 2023. Thank you. And operator, please open the lines.Ken Cook: And Stephen, one note before we do that, we did experience a technical difficulty with a webcast this morning. So apologies to those of you who've missed a portion of our prepared remarks.

Moreover, high fuel costs are restricting bottom-line growth.Despite the abovementioned challenges, we believe that the space still has fuel left in the tank, especially for operators that target growth opportunities and operating efficiency initiatives. Even though economies are reopening, consumers’ thirst for online shopping is rampant. The still impressive e-commerce demand scenario is a huge positive for the industry participants. High shipping rates should also drive revenues. In view of these favorable developments surrounding the space, we advise investors to focus on United Parcel Service UPS, FedEx FDX and Air Transport Services Group ATSG.About the IndustryThe companies housed in the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry provide air delivery and freight services. Most players in the space are involved in offering specialized transportation and logistics services. Some participants offer a range of supply-chain solutions, such as freight forwarding, customs brokerage, fulfillment, returns, financial transactions and repairs. The well-being of the companies in this industrial cohort is directly proportional to the health of the economy. Leading industry players, including UPS, transport millions of packages each day across the globe. Apart from operating a ground fleet of multiple vehicles, some of these companies maintain an air fleet. While some players focus on providing air transportation services for passengers and cargo, others deliver services to entities that outsource air-cargo lifting requirements.3 Key Trends to Watch in the Transportation-Air Freight &amp; Cargo IndustryStrong Financial Returns for Shareholders: With economic activities gaining pace, more and more companies are allocating their increasing cash pile by way of dividends and buybacks to pacify the long-suffering shareholders, thereby underlining their financial strength and confidence in business. Among the Transportation – Air Freight and Cargo industry players, UPS announced a 6.6% hike in its quarterly dividend in January 2023, apart from unveiling a new share buyback program.Story continuesE-commerce A Key Catalyst: It is hardly surprising that the pace of growth of e-commerce demand has slowed from the levels witnessed at the peak of the pandemic. Despite the slowdown as economies re-open, the same remains impressive, driven by the convenience associated with-line shopping. The race to digitization also supports the momentum in e-commerce growth.  E-commerce demand strength should continue to support growth of the industry players. Favorable pricing will also bear good news for the industry players.Supply-Chain Woes &amp; High Costs a Downside: Supply-chain disturbances and a tight labor market are ailing the Air Freight and Cargo Industry players. Higher labor and transportation costs are aggravating their woes. Shortage of labor impaired their ability to meet high demand. Costs will likely continue to be steep going forward due to supply-chain troubles. The spike in fuel costs is also increasing the operating expenses of the industry players. Even though oil price has declined from its multi-year highs due to recession fears, it remains high. Notably, oil price was up 6.7% in the October-December period. Fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player. Naturally, operating expenses are on the way up given the rise in fuel cost.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Air Freight and Cargo industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #101. This rank places it in the top 40% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dismal near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining in confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimate for 2023 has increased 19.7% on a year-over-year basis.Before we present a few stocks from the industry that investors can retain in their portfolios, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and the valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 and SectorThe Zacks Air Freight and Cargo industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the broader Transportation sector over the past year.The industry has decreased 24.3% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s depreciation of 13% and the broader sector’s decline of 14.6%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), a commonly used multiple for valuing Transportation-Air Freight and Cargo stocks, the industry is currently trading at 7.97X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 12.15X. It is also lower than the sector’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA of 10.66X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 13.37X, as low as 6.56X and at the median of 9.79X.Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA Ratio (TTM)3 Transportation-Air Freight and Cargo Stocks to Keep a Tab OnUPS: The rapid e-commerce growth rate in the current scenario is a huge plus for Atlanta-based UPS, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Robust free cash flow generation by UPS is a major positive, leading to an uptick in its shareholder-friendly activities.UPS earnings outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters.UPS shares have gained 9.8% over the past three months.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  Price and Consensus: UPSFedEx: FDX’s efforts to reward its shareholders even in these difficult times are praiseworthy. In June 2022, FedEx raised its quarterly dividend by 53% to $1.15 per share (or $4.60 annually). FDX is also active on the buyback front. During fiscal 2022, FedEx repurchased shares worth $2.2 billion. FedEx's liquidity position is also solid.FDX’s efforts to cut costs are driving its bottom line. Despite the global weakness, FDX's second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings per share came above expectations. Moreover, the top line was favorably impacted by yield improvement and higher fuel surcharges. FDX shares have gained 20.6% over the past three months. FDX currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Price and Consensus: FDXAir Transport Services Group: Wilmington, OH-based ATSG is a leading provider of aircraft leasing, and air-cargo transportation and related services globally. Over the past 60 days, Air Transport Services, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 being raised by 2.5%.The strength in e-commerce demand is a tailwind for Air Transport Services Group.

MLAB is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Feb 6, before market open.In the last-reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $2.88 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 107.2%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions and missed the same in the other two, delivering an earnings surprise of 16.6%, on average.Let’s see how things have shaped up for MLAB prior to this announcement:Factors to NoteClinical GenomicsDuring the second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings release in November, Mesa Laboratories’ Clinical Genomics segment (added after the completion of the acquisition of Agena Bioscience, Inc.) witnessed robust global systems placements and China revenues. This resulted from a strong rebound of these two sources in the quarter after timing issues and lockdown-related headwinds eased from the fiscal first quarter. The segment also saw strong revenue contributions (excluding COVID-19-related revenues) during its first twelve months of ownership, which was in line with the guidance provided at the time of the acquisition.In the fiscal third quarter, the strong momentum of global systems placements is likely to have continued, thereby strongly contributing to segmental revenues.Mesa Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Mesa Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMesa Laboratories, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Mesa Laboratories, Inc. Quote Other Factors to NoteIn the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Mesa Laboratories witnessed strong bookings growth in its Sterilization and Disinfection Control segment. The segment also benefited from improving labor-based constraints in its Bozeman, MT facility. Management had confirmed during the fiscal second-quarter earnings release that strong execution of process improvement initiatives in commercial engagement, labor supply and supply-chain execution had driven its strong revenue growth and profitability improvements in the quarter. This momentum is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, thereby driving up the overall revenues.Story continuesHowever, the current unstable macroeconomic business environment, resulting from the supply-chain constraints, unfavorable currency movement and inflationary pressures, is likely to have weighed on the company’s fiscal third-quarter revenues, raising our apprehension.The Estimate PictureFor third-quarter fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $57.7 million for total revenues implies an improvement of 5.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $2.10    , indicating an uptick of 54.4% from the prior-year period’s reported number.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP, has higher chances of beating estimates.

We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, Zimmer Biomet has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Abbott has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that ZBH has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.ZBH currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.29, while ABT has a forward P/E of 25.23. We also note that ZBH has a PEG ratio of 2.39. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. ABT currently has a PEG ratio of 4.96.Another notable valuation metric for ZBH is its P/B ratio of 2.18. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ABT has a P/B of 5.37.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ZBH's Value grade of B and ABT's Value grade of C.Story continuesZBH stands above ABT thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that ZBH is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript January 31, 2023Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Mondelez International Fourth Quarter 2022 and Full-Year Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Sir, please go ahead.Shep Dunlap: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the Company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results.In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Today, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update, followed by review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&amp;A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk.Dirk Van de Put: Thanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on Slide 4. I am pleased to share that we delivered another record year, not only in size of the company, but also in profit dollar growth. Our strong topline performance was driven by excellent pricing execution and continued volume strength as consumers all over the world remain loyal to our iconic snacking brands. We delivered strong topline performance in both emerging and developed markets while continuing to exercise cost discipline. In keeping with our strategy of achieving global snacking leadership, we continue investing in our brands and capabilities while strengthening our portfolio with important bolt-on acquisitions that increase our exposure to attractive and growing categories and profit pools.Story continuesWe executed well against our long-term algorithm, returning $4 billion in capital to shareholders. Perhaps most importantly, we continue to invest in our people, building a deep and diverse team whose local routes and global insights enable us to stay a step ahead of rapidly changing customer and consumer tastes. We are confident that the strength of our brands, our proven strategy, our continued investments, and especially our great people position us well to achieve our long-term financial targets in 2023 and beyond. Along with our financial performance, I'm pleased to share that we made significant progress towards our environmental, social and governance agenda. You recall from our investor update last spring that we have elevated sustainability as the fourth pillar of our growth acceleration strategy.That's because we firmly believe that helping to drive positive change at scale is an integral part of our value creation with positive returns for all our stakeholders. Let me share a few highlights on Slide 5. First, we continued to advance our leadership in more sustainably sourcing cocoa and wheat, our two most critical ingredients. We launched the next chapter of Cocoa Life, our signature cocoa sourcing program with another $600 million commitment, bringing our total investment to $1 billion. Cocoa Life is working to lift up the people and restore landscapes where cocoa grows. Similarly, we will launch in the first quarter of 2023, an updated vision for our Harmony Wheat program focused on more sustainably sourcing wheat across the European Union.We continued advancing our Light and Right packaging strategy. For example, our Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand now are wrapped in packaging with more than 30% recycled content. We also continue to make progress on tackling climate change. We expanded our use of renewable energy to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse emissions, and in about 80% of farms in our Cocoa Life program in West Africa, we achieved near to no deforestation, reducing Scope 3 emissions. Since 2018, we have reduced our CO2 emissions by more than 20%. We also remain focused on advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion because we firmly believe that diverse perspectives and viewpoints make our company stronger while helping us stay closer to our customers and consumers.As an example, we increase the gender and racial diversity of our Board of Directors with the appointment of industry leading experts. We are proud of team Mondelez continued success in making important impacts on these critical environmental, social and issues, while creating value for our shareholders and other key stakeholders. Turning to Slide 6, you can see that we had a record year despite challenging operating conditions. We view our strong performance in 2022 as evidence that our long-term strategy continues to deliver for our stakeholders. Organic volume grew 2.7% for the year on pace with recent years, demonstrating the continued strength of our resilient brands and categories even in an inflationary environment. Organic net revenue grew by 12.3%, significantly lapping the prior three years performance with broad-based growth across all regions.We also delivered record adjusted gross profit dollar growth of $1.4 billion. We are proud of our team's ability to offset major cost pressures to enable us to continue investing in the business, which will drive further growth acceleration. Accordingly, we increased A&amp;C investment by double-digit, helping to keep our brand top of mind for both consumers and customers. These pricing cost management an investing activities translated into strong operating income growth of more than $580 million. We remain confident that our virtuous cycle of strong gross profit dollar growth, which fuels local first commercial investment and execution, will continue to consistently deliver attractive profit growth. We are especially confident that our unique growth strategy centered on acceleration and focus will enable us to continue to successfully navigate the dynamic global operating environment, differentiating us from many other food companies.On Slide 7, you can see that despite the volatile environment, we have the right setup and strategy to ensure we deliver against our growth algorithm. Momentum in emerging markets, with particularly China and India showing strong results combined with the resilience of our categories as evidenced by strong volume growth is helping us to offset the challenges that many companies are facing, such as global cost inflation, the energy crisis, recession concerns in Europe and supply chain volatility. Our consumer continues to hold up well across most geographies, prioritizing snacking and buying more volumes of our products despite significant price increases. Our U.S. supply chain is gradually getting back to normal after a long period of sub-optimal customer service triggered by the 2021 strike and the subsequent overall supply chain volatility.We are continuing to implement appropriate incremental price increases across key markets, including Europe. We also continue to take appropriate action to hedge our commodity costs while continuing to advance our ongoing productivity initiatives. All of the above allows us to increase our investment in brands and capabilities every year, which underpin our growth momentum. Our ability to deliver real dollar growth enables us to make sound and choiceful decisions that drive the business forward and position us well for continued future growth. Slide 8 shows that our performance in 2022 gives us confidence that we have not only the right growth plan, but also the right execution to deliver it. Our core categories of chocolate and biscuits remain attractive and durable in both developed and emerging markets.We are accelerating our focus on these core categories because they have attractive growth and profitability characteristics and still a significant headroom in terms of penetration and per capita consumption. Our long-term vision is to generate 90% of revenue through these two core categories. We hit an exciting milestone in the biscuit category this year as Oreo surpassed $4 billion in global net revenue, further solidifying its position as the world's favorite cookie. Our acquisitions of Chipita and Clif Bar helped us expand our footprint in the growing Baked Snacks segment. While our acquisition of Ricolino helped us fill an important geographic white space, establishing a strong foothold in a priority emerging market of Mexico. We also continue to expand our presence in high growth channels, segments and price tiers.Confectionery, Cookies, SweetsPhoto by Vinícius Müller on UnsplashFor example, silk premium chocolate doubled its prior year penetration in India, while in emerging markets, we added more than 400,000 additional outlets, and we have significant runway ahead of us. These are just a few examples of the ways our teams remain relentlessly focused on delivering the growth and acceleration plan we outlined at our Investor Day last spring. As Slide 9 indicates, we continue working hard to reshape our portfolio, which will accelerate our growth, and I'm pleased to share that we made significant progress in 2022. As we continue to drive focus on chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks, our nine strategic acquisitions since 2018 have enabled us to enter exciting adjacent spaces such as wellbeing and premium. They also have strengthened our presence in key geographies and expanded our trade coverage.Together, these acquisitions add nearly $3 billion in revenues and are all growing high single- or double-digit. Strong execution against our proven integration playbook enabled us to rapidly realize the value of the three acquisitions we closed in 2022. The Chipita business provides us an important platform to further accelerate growth in the attractive biscuits and baked snacks category. Similarly, Clif Bar expands our global snack bar business to more than $1 billion. Additionally, Ricolino Mexico's leading confectionary company doubles the size of our business and more than triples our routes to market in Mexico. Along with successfully integrating these three businesses, we announced in late 2022 the sale of our developed market gum business to Perfetti Van Melle for an implied EBITDA multiple of about 15x.This divesture will help fund these recent acquisitions and streamline our portfolio. We continue to have the Halls business, which has been performing well, but still intend to divest it over time in a way that maximizes value. In conclusion, I'm pleased to reiterate that 2022 was a record year. Our focus and portfolio reshaping strategy is working and we are well positioned to continue driving attractive growth in 2023 and beyond. By continuing to double down on the attractive chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks categories, investing in our iconic brands, focusing on operational execution and cost discipline, and empowering our great people, I am confident that we can deliver strong performance for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials.Luca Zaramella: Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon, everyone. In 2022, we delivered unprecedentedly strong results, starting with double-digit topline growth through both volume and value, which in turn translated into gross profit dollar growth, allowing the investment in the business, solid earnings and cash flow. Growth was also broad-based in terms of regions, categories and brands. Revenue growth was 12.3% and 15.4% for the year and the quarter, respectively. Importantly, nearly 3 points of full-year growth and 1.6 point of Q4 came from volume mix. Emerging markets increased 22% for the year and 24.7% for the quarter with strong performance across a significant majority of countries, including Brazil, China, India, Russia, Mexico, the Western Andean countries, and Southeast Asia.More than 7 points of full-year growth in emerging market was driven by volume mix, confirming the great momentum of these geographies. Developed markets grew 7% for the year, and 10.5% for the quarter. Volume mix in developed markets was flat in Q4 as there were still some ongoing negotiations at the beginning of the quarter in the EU, that resulted in customer disruption, which in turn offset some good momentum in countries like the U.S, Canada, Australia, and others. Those negotiations are now fully closed, but we have just announced another pricing round in Europe. Turning to portfolio performance on Slide 12. Our chocolate and biscuit businesses both delivered double-digit growth, while gum and candy continue to recover with improved mobility.Biscuits grew 11.7% for the year and 18% for the quarter, supported by significant volume growth. Oreo, Ritz, Chips Ahoy!, Tate's, Give &amp; Go and Club Social were among the brands that performed very well. Chocolate grew more than 10% for both the year and quarter with significant growth across both developed and emerging markets. Volume mix was virtually flat in Q4 due to customer disruption in Europe. Emerging market posted exceptional double-digit growth for the year and the quarter. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Lacta and Toblerone, all delivered robust growth. Gum and candy grew 25% for the year and the quarter. Brazil, Mexico, and the Western Andean area all performed well. Now let's review market share performance on Slide 13. We held or gained share in 40% of our revenue base, which includes 15 points of headwinds coming from the U.S. supply chain, that while improving, still weighs on the full-year share performance.Chocolate held or gained share in 50% of our revenue base. This number include a strong Christmas season, which gains in several key countries, but also reflect customer disruption in Europe. Retailer and consumer activities are now vastly restored in the region, but the price that we just announced might have a negative impact in the first two quarters of 2023 as far as share goes. Our biscuit business held or gained share in 25% of our revenue base. This includes 30 points of headwind from the U.S. supply constraint and customer disruption in Europe. The U.S. made significant service level improvements in the back half of 2022 narrowing share losses and we expect this trajectory to continue to improve in 2023. Turning to Page 14. For the year, we delivered strong double-digit OI dollar growth, driven by a record high increasing gross profit of nearly $1.4 billion.In Q4, we also saw strong double-digit OI and gross profit dollar growth. Moving to regional performance on Slide 15. Europe grew 7.4% for the year and 8.7% for the quarter. Thanks to strong execution, volume mix was flat for the year despite customer disruption in Q3 and Q4. Brand support remains a priority in the region and we have continued to increase our A&amp;C. OI dollars for the year were up 4.3% and 12.4% for the quarter and the year, respectively. Q4 profitability saw a return to growth due to an additional price increase and the emerging market performance within the segment. To close on Europe, we continue to see more pronounced inflation in this region based on energy and other input costs. We also expect to see challenge margins in Q1 given our expectations of customer disruption.Although we saw a small uptick in elasticity for Q4, European consumer has continued to hold up well and the preference for snacking and trusted brands remains strong with elasticity levels below normal. North America grew 12.3% for the full-year and 19.5% for the quarter, higher pricing, robust volume mix and strength from our ventures such as Tate's and Give &amp; Go fueled those increases. Volume mix was 0.8% for the year and 4.2% for the quarter. North America profit increased 18.7% for the year and 37.3% for the quarter due to strong pricing and healthy volume results. Besides the benefits of our pricing execution, the consumer remains resilient and elasticity continues to be well below normal levels. AMEA grew 12.5% for the year and 13.6% for the quarter with strong volume growth for both periods.India grew strong double-digit for the year and quarter, driven by both chocolate and biscuit. China increased high-single digits for the year despite COVID restrictions in certain cities and posted double-digit growth for the quarter. Finally, Southeast Asia also delivered strong double-digit growth for both periods. AMEA increased OI dollars by 9.8% for the year and 8.8% for the quarter continuing their virtual cycle. Latin America grew 31.9% for the year and 37.1% for the quarter with robust volume mix growth coupled with strong price contributions. All key markets posted double-digit increases for the quarter. Latin America has had its strongest year ever in terms of OI delivery. In fact, OI dollars in Latin America grew 48.5% for the year and more than 45% for the quarter.Broad-based volume growth, pricing and ongoing improvements from the gum and candy categories drove these results. Next to EPS on Slide 16. Full-year EPS grew 11.9% in constant currency. This growth was primarily driven by operating gains. And despite very significant currency headwinds, we grew adjusted EPS as reported ForEx by 3.5%. Turning to Slide 17. We delivered $3 billion of free cash flow for the full-year, including a one-time expense of $300 million related to the Clif acquisition and buyout of its employee stock ownership plan. Turning to outlook on Page 19. For the current year, we expect to deliver on or in excess of our long-term algorithm for all variables. There might still be meaningful variability for the year, so we expect plus 5% to plus 7% organic net revenue growth, which stands from the higher pricing.We also expect on our growth to adjusted EPS of high single-digit. Somewhat like 2022, we expect a slightly different shape related to the P&amp;L with higher topline, strong profit dollar growth and lower than historical margin rate given elevated inflation and related pricing away in dollar terms. As far as assumptions grow, we are planning for another year of double-digit inflation with dollars higher than in 2022. This inflation is driven by the continued elevated cost in packaging, energy, ingredients and labor. This input costs are also more pronounced in Europe and some select emerging markets. We also had favorable coverage versus the market in 2022. And although spot rates have been easing in many cases, new hedges are coming at higher levels than what was incorporated in March of last year.We are taking action with a flexible hedging program by using options to minimize risk and volatility, whether commodity rise or fall significantly from current rate. That is to reassure you that in case of commodity price dislocations, we will still be in a position to hit our profit commitment while still investing for growth. In terms of interest expenses, we expect an incremental $90 million for the line associated with the financing of recent acquisitions that we plan to repay later in the year with the developed gum divestiture proceed. We are planning for a net increase in total pension cost of around $25 million as above the line service cost will be lower and below the line element will be worse due to the rising interest rate. Important to note that due to our strong funding levels, we do not have to make additional contributions to our plan.We will also benefit from the higher OI dollar contribution from the acquisitions of Clif and Ricolino and their related synergies. In terms of phasing, we expect Q1 to be lower from a margin rate perspective due to lower volumes in Europe associated with the expected customer disruptions and Chinese New Year phasing. Disruption in Europe might also continue into Q2. We are expecting $0.04 of EPS headwinds related to ForEx. With respect to free cash flow, we expect another strong year with $3.3 billion plus absent any significant one-time non-operating item. In this outlook, we also expect an adjusted effective tax rate in the low to mid-20s based on what we know today and a share repurchase of around $2 billion.

MDLZ grew more than 1% after the trading session on Jan 31, following the impressive fourth-quarter 2022 numbers.

The metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents per share. The year-over-year upside was backed by reduced outstanding shares, and solid operating gains. This was partly countered by the increased taxes, elevated interest expenses and lower income from equity method investments.Net revenues advanced 13.5% to $8,695 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,373 million. The uptick was driven by strong organic net revenue growth of 15.4%, and increased sales from the Chipita, Clif Bar and Ricolino buyout, somewhat negated by currency headwinds. Favorable volumes and pricing contributed to organic net revenues.Revenues from emerging markets increased 23.3% to $3,320 million, while rising 24.7% on an organic basis.

These were somewhat negated by favorable pricing.Mondelez’s adjusted operating income rose $201 million at cc. The adjusted operating income margin contracted by 30 bps to 15% due to inflated input costs and an adverse mix, largely countered by SG&amp;A leverage and favorable pricing.Story continuesOther FinancialsThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,923 million, long-term debt of $20,251 million, and total equity of $26,920 million.

A quarter ago, it was expected that this medical device manufacturer would post earnings of $0.44 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.43, delivering a surprise of -2.27%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Boston Scientific , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry, posted revenues of $3.24 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.12%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.13 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Boston Scientific shares have lost about 0% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.2%.What's Next for Boston Scientific?While Boston Scientific has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Boston Scientific: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

You can stay on top of your finances and see your balances, transfer money and deposit checks easily within the app. Users can also access their car and mortgage information and credit cards from wherever they are.A unique feature the Chase bank app offers is Chase QuickPay, an application similar to Zelle or Venmo, that allows users to easily send and receive money from anyone who has a U.S. bank account.Capital OneThe Capital One app offers a feature well-loved by its users called Eno. Eno is a virtual assistant that can answer questions and help users navigate the app and be informed of all the app options available to them.In addition to this app’s helpful guide, the Capital One app features account management, mobile check deposit and the opportunity to set financial goals. The mobile app offers immediate push notifications so you can keep track of your credit and transaction history and access all financial information — including car and mortgage information.

Guests at last month's event included Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan, Coca-Cola Company CEO James Quincey, and Grab CEO Anthony Tan. Here on Leadership Next, the three leaders discuss the business challenges they anticipate throughout the next decade, from responding to societal problems, to reconfiguring supply chains because of geopolitical issues.Also on the episode, Fortune's Jeremy Kahn talks the good, the bad, and what we have yet to figure out about ChatGPT, the subject of his recent Fortune cover story.Listen to Leadership Next or read the full transcript below.TranscriptAlan Murray: Leadership Next is powered by the folks at Deloitte, who, like me, are super focused on how CEOs can lead in the context of disruption and evolving societal expectations.Welcome to Leadership Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I'm Alan Murray here for the very first episode of 2023 with my incomparable, incredible co-host, Ellen McGirt.Ellen McGirt: Oh, Alan, I have missed those affirmative greetings, and I've missed you. And I've missed the conversations we've gotten to have over the years on Leadership Next, and I'm excited to tell everyone that we have a pretty special episode for you all. Today, we're all going to be bringing you some exclusive content from the dinner Fortune hosted in Davos two weeks ago. So, what was it like to get everyone back together for the wintery Davos conversations?Murray: Cold. Look, Ellen, first of all, I've missed you, too. So I'm glad we're back. The dinner was pretty amazing. We had 60 CEOs of some of the largest companies in the world, very engaging conversation. We really focused on the top challenges and the top opportunities for business in 2023.Story continuesMcGirt: I remember when we did a version of this episode in 2022. CEOs were very concerned, inflation was top of mind, supply chain disruptions, and of course, retaining top talent was a big issue. And you know, I consider you my personal Davos correspondent, what was the mood? Are these still the big concerns, or have things changed?Murray: I'm happy to be your personal Davos correspondent, and here's what I took from the conversations. You know, most of the CEOs think we're going to have a recession this year. But that was not what they wanted to talk about. They were not focused on the recession that may happen in the next 12 months. What they were focused on were the big transformations that are going to play out over the next 10 years. How is A.I. and other technology going to completely transform their business? How are we actually going to get the economy retooled for this challenge of getting to net zero carbon emissions by 2050? And how are companies going to reconfigure their supply chains to deal with the geopolitical challenges and the need for resiliency that has come up in in the wake of the pandemic? So it was really a moment of reimagination [of] boy, we have to rethink what we do, or we may not be around 10 years from now.McGirt: And I hope that a part of that was where everyone wherever they sit in the hierarchy of a company or in the hierarchy of their lives, gets to participate in that retooling because I think that's a big part of what's coming down the road, equality, equity, ESG, all of that.Murray: It's an unusual moment in the history of business, where companies feel like they have not just permission but a mandate to rethink the way they do things and to try and make business better. And Ellen in just a few minutes, we're going to hear from the CEOs that I spoke to in Davos about their takes on the biggest business challenges and opportunities of the coming decade. But first we've got to discuss one of the Top Hot Topics in Davos, the buzziest tech topic of the moment, which is generative AI and particularly this tool ChatGPT.From a recorded news report: Microsoft recently announced it's set to make a multibillion dollar investment into the artificial intelligence company, OpenAI parent company of ChatGBT.From a recorded news report: Ammaar Reshi asked a computer programmer to write a book. And in a weekend, Alice and Sparkle was finished. ChatGPT is technology accessible and free to anyone on the web, type in a request and it can write legal documents, software, even school essays.From a recorded news report: Get ready to laugh, cry, maybe even throw your computer out the window. Because the latest A.I. technology ChatGPT is here to shake things up.McGirt: It is both of our lucky day, because we have a special guest here today to talk us through those questions, concerns and of course my existential ChatGPT crisis. Jeremy Kahn is a senior writer here at Fortune. He reports on A.I. and disruptive technology, so he's the perfect guest to walk us through all of this. Welcome, Jeremy.Murray: Jeremy, it's really great to have you with us. The cover story you wrote for the February March issue of Fortune's magazine is a powerful piece. And what struck me when I read it is that it's sort of echoed the conversations that I was having in Davos, which is we are on the cusp of this extraordinary period that has great exciting possibilities for things we can do to solve problems and build great businesses. But it also has these massive threats. And ChatGPT and the promise of generative A.I. seems to be a perfect example of that: great possibilities, massive threats and how do you balance the two?Jeremy Kahn: Yeah, that's, that's absolutely true. I mean, it's, it's, it's a technology with incredible potential to do a lot of good, to make people, you know, incredibly more productive, and at the same time, you know, a lot of people are very concerned about it supercharging misinformation, making it very easy for people to create, you know, vast amounts of untruthful stuff that they can put out on the internet. People are very worried about its potential in cybersecurity. It makes it very easy to, at the very least, create kind of convincing phishing emails. But a number of cybersecurity companies have found that they can also use it to write malware.McGirt: I just want to circle back before we get into what the possibilities are. For anybody who has not yet read your story and is really new to this conversation. What exactly is ChatGPT? How do we describe it?Kahn: ChatGPT is a chatbot. But it's sort of unlike any chatbot you've probably ever interacted with before. It is an interface that OpenAI created. You can sign up for an account for free. You do have to provide them some information about yourself to sign up for an account. And then it allows you to interact with a chatbot and you can literally ask it anything and it will respond. And people have been using this not just to sort of have a casual conversation but to ask it to do specific tasks. People have asked it to design exercise plans for them, to design business plans, as I mentioned before, to create software, including malware in some cases. But you can ask it to do pretty much anything and it will take a stab at doing it. It responds with natural language text, some of what it says it turns out, you know will not be true. They tend to invent things. So it will sometimes invent information, if you ask it to write Alan Murray's biography, for instance, there's a very good chance that it will say some things in there that are not actually true.Murray: Someone did this, and it said I was 77 years old. So yes.Kahn: Yeah, so that's, that is a problem with it. But it is it is a very powerful technology. And it is, is much more fluid and fluent in lots of different topics than previous chatbots have been.Murray: So Jeremy, let me let me focus on the positive side for a minute. And then let Ellen focus on the negative side, because that's the way, that's kind of the way this podcast works.McGirt: Jeremy, it's true.Murray: But so I read a an interesting book by a couple of marketing executives who had spent months playing around with it. And what they said is, it's kind of like, you know, let's think you're you want to come up with a marketing plan for our company. And so normally, what you would do is you go to a couple of two-year associates, and you say, hey, give us 10 options for how we market this product. And they spend a few weeks and they come back, and they give you a list of 10 options. And then you really dig in and figure out which of them are B.S., and which of them are really viable, and you do your due diligence, etc. What they were saying is ChatGPT can basically do the job of those two-year associates, but do it in three seconds, you know, so you get that off. And but then you have to do you, hey, is this right? Is this a good idea or a bad idea? What are they missing, etc. So it's a very good kind of first draft for a lot of exercises. I can see that as a tool that would make business much faster and more efficient than it is today.Kahn: Yeah, I think that's absolutely true. People are using it in that way already. And then there's a whole group of companies that are building on the underlying technology, which are these things called large language models. And there are a whole bunch of startups that have created whole businesses that kind of hook into the GPT-3 API that OpenAI offers. And you can have it do in this case, specific tasks. So if you want it to write marketing blogs, you just you can go to a company called Jasper and you can use their software which has actually been fine tuned even for that purpose. And have it write, you know, blogs for you, have it write marketing material. There's a company called Tome that I talked to that does all kinds of different presentations. They actually kind of specialize in narratives. So you can you can say I want to, I want a narrative slide deck, that is, you know, outlines a movie idea and it'll do it in two seconds, and even illustrates it with A.I.-generated art.Murray: And the message is, don't take it as done, take it as your first draft, and then use human wisdom and human creativity to perfect it.Kahn: And I think for a lot of people, you know, as you said, Alan, if they were assigning this to a junior employee, they would probably have to, you know, edit it anyway. It wasn't going to be perfect copy, or exactly what they would want. But now it's done in two seconds, whereas they, they might have had the employee spend at least an hour on it, maybe half a day, maybe a whole day, depending on what it was.McGirt: Well, this is where we cue the menacing music, isn't it Alan? This is where I come in. I'm going to, instead of just feeding the beast, I'm just going to ask you where this can go wrong. But I do want to comment for the record here, that at least it's refreshing that we have in the digital age, a technology CEO who openly admits that this thing could be heaven or this thing could be Armageddon, like they just don't know. I think that that's problematic. If you're not sure you should not bring a product to market. But Jeremy, where should we land on this?Kahn: That's a good question. There are certainly lots of people who agree with you Ellen and think that if you're not sure the product is totally safe, why deploy it? OpenAI, who, you know, I interviewed a number of executives there for the story, they argue that the only way to actually find out where the product might be unsafe is to put it out in the world and let people play with it and then if they see something that looks particularly menacing or a bad use case, then they can try to put guardrails around that. And to be a little bit fair to OpenAI, they did try to put some basic guardrails around ChatGPT. So if you ask it directly for instance, like the example with malware, if you ask it directly to create malware for you, it won't do it. But if you know a little bit saying like I want, I want like a PowerShell function that will do the following thing, then it'll go ahead and do it.Some people found some easy ways around some guardrails they had around hate speech. So one of the things if you ask it to, you know, write a play that is antisemitic in nature, let's say, it won't do it. But if you say to it, well, let's pretend we're writing a play that, you know, has to have this function. And I actually wanted to educate people about you know, why antisemitism is bad. But what would I have the evil characters in this play say? And then it will generate lots of antisemitic content. So it turned out there were easy ways around some of these guardrails. And the company is also to its credit, now that it's seen people do this, trying to come up with ways to to reinforce those guardrails. But I think the other question that's raised here, that's potentially a downside is, you know, the thing we just talked about is that even if it works well, does it put people out of work? And I think that's, you know, a big issue. It's a potential potential downside, and does it that, you know, it could make business much more efficient, but at the cost of a lot of people's jobs.McGirt: So what should we what should we be looking for going forward?Kahn: Yeah, well, I think going forward, these systems just get more and more capable. I think some of these issues will be improved upon, they're working on ways to try to make its output more factually accurate, ways to try to allow us a system to cite the sources of its information. Some people close to OpenAI say that these issues will be solved within a year. A lot of other people say they're very much more fundamental than that and it's going to take several years and more breakthroughs before these are solved.But I think in the meantime, you get you could probably get bots that are more and more capable and you get them fine tuned, maybe for individual professions. So a lot of people talk about, you know, every profession having a copilot. Reid Hoffman, who's an early investor in OpenAI and sits on their board is a fan of this idea of every professional within two to five years have a copilot. But ultimately, it's still going to be a human in the loop and the human expert is still going to have to pass judgment on those ideas and refine them. So it's not necessarily going to eliminate humans altogether. We're not going to be fully automating professions, but everyone may have this assistant that makes them much more capable.Murray: Well, Jeremy, it's a fascinating technology, a fascinating topic, probably one of the most important topics of our time. Thank you for writing such a great story and please stay on top of it.Kahn: Thank you very much.Murray: So, Ellen, ChatGPT was also top of mind for at least one of the CEOs I spoke with at Fortune's Davos dinner. Vas Narasimhan, the CEO of the pharmaceutical giant Novartis, sees the technology as one of the year's biggest assets, and also one of its biggest risks.McGirt: Okay, let's dive right in. But just a note for everyone listening, this panel did happen during an actual dinner. So in the clips throughout this episode, you might hear some light clanking of silverware and tipping of glasses. Let's jump right in.Vasant Narasimhan: First, I want to tell a quick anecdote before coming to this session, I had asked ChatGPT what the answers should be to Alan and the big challenge was to come up with something that ChatGPT didn't already say, so that I'm more relevant than an algorithm. But, you know, the reality is, I think ChatGPT is emblematic of a huge opportunity for us as business leaders. When you think about generative AI and now how fast we all are thinking about how to apply it. What I reflect on is how many other lateral technologies or technologies exist that we haven't taken to scale that can solve either critical business issues or critical ESG topics, environmental topics in our companies. I think when you think about trying to get to circularity, managing our plastics, managing our water, getting to green energy across our supply chains. We hear about so many technologies in the sessions at Davos. I think the real challenge is how to take them to scale. When you look at the history, when you look at what Steven Pinker writes about, and you look about about some of the thinkers who write about how did humans actually get to the place where we live in such an extraordinary time? It's all in how we deploy technology fast. And I think technologies get deployed fast through business.Murray: And if technology is the big opportunity, what's the big challenge?Narasimhan: Well, I think for me the the big challenge for this year for all of us in a completely different turn, is how do we keep our organizations as humans mentally fit and in cultures that they believe in? And we have to be realistic that people around the world have gone through a pandemic. They've gone through seeing a war happen, that has not happened in a long period of time, certainly in Europe. They've seen hyperinflation, many of which have not seen in a long period of time. Our cultures are eroding because we have virtual work and whole new ways of working. I think the question for us as leaders, it's in the context of all of that, maybe now people are thinking, will they be replaced by a ChatGPT algorithm? How do they understand all of this? How do we make sense of it for them? And how do we build cultures that can actually last and be successful?McGirt: That was fascinating, Alan. In addition to the culture problem, which I confess I hadn't fully considered, as I mentioned, in our conversation with Jeremy, I'm also worried about workers, particularly the underrepresented workers, who have been increasingly vulnerable to being replaced by all sorts of technology for years now. And especially if they're lower in the corporate hierarchy, who aren't likely to be anyone's copilot and be replaced by this technology. What is their path forward?Murray: You know, Ellen, it's fair to worry about that. But I think the hope is that this will create tools that will enable them to function better in this economy of the future. It actually becomes an aid that makes them more productive, and doesn't necessarily require them to have a high degree of technical education to do so. You know, it was interesting. In fact, James Quincey, the CEO of Coca-Cola, who was also there, thinks that the way for businesses to stay competitive in the future, given that technology is sort of taking care of itself to some degree, is that people need to tap into their insights about humans, human beings and their values.James Quincey: The opportunity is to embrace the challenge that every consumer company needs to make itself relevant and the next generation of consumers.Murray: And what's...Quincey: You said short answers.Murray: No, that was good. That was good. But you can go a little longer than that. How do you grab that opportunity?Quincey: How do you grab that opportunity? Look, it's about human, it's about human insights. I mean, that for all the technology that that is out there, the underlying core human values are pretty universal and pretty unchanging. We keep thinking the world is profoundly different. And we have some profound challenges that I'm sure we'll get to. The opportunity is to make relevant our businesses for the next generation, while solving the societal challenges, the sheer scale of our population, and our economic activity is throwing off.[Music]Murray: I'm here with Joe Ucuzoglu, who is the CEO of Deloitte and had the good sense to sponsor this podcast. Thanks for being with us and thanks for your support.Joe Ucuzoglu: Thanks, Alan. Pleasure to be here.Murray: So Joe, this new wave of business technology, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, the ability to make intelligence out of data, is creating huge opportunities for companies. But a lot of the CEOs I talked to feel daunted by it. It's like, where do they get the imagination to rethink their entire corporation? How do they deal with that?Ucuzoglu: The opportunities are immense, particularly when you look at not just any one of these technologies individually, but the convergence of all of them collectively creating the opportunity to truly transform business models. And I know it can seem daunting, but the reality is taking a first step in actually produces huge benefit. Because what we're finding is that many of the cutting-edge applications are not coming out of the corporate headquarters. They're coming out of putting the technology in the hands of our people on the front lines. They find new and innovative uses. We then funnel them back up and leverage them across the entire client base.Murray: Yeah, it really gets to the importance of a culture of innovation at the company.Ucuzoglu: It is essential that our people feel empowered to take the latest and greatest and define new innovative ways to use it for productive purposes.Murray: Thank you, Joe.Ucuzoglu: Alan, it's a real pleasure.[End music]McGirt: Okay, Alan, so topic switch here. We're almost three years out from the uprisings of 2020, in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd. And we know that in that year, a lot of businesses made really big promises to their employees and customers and other stakeholders around equity and social justice. We know that because we covered it, and we lived it. But I think 2023 is the year we're really going to get to see if those promises are going to be kept in what form. I know, I'm going to be keeping an eye on it, on which companies are following through and what they're learning, which I think is going to be really important to understand.But Alan, there's something else that I've been wondering about related to all of that. And this is about politics and culture. And I know that we talk about this, and you have amazing insights into what this has meant over the years. Will business leaders respond to the political and cultural changes in 2023. We've had so many conversations with CEOs about the pressure to respond to societal issues and legislation that some people might feel as problematic, the inevitable  criticism of the woke CEOs that comes along with all of that. So from your view, is this pressure and the criticism still top of mind for CEOs? And do you think businesses are still going to be committed to the big lofty goals they have set over the past three years?Murray: Ellen, it's a great question, you know, will CEOs back off in the face of political pressure that's increasing among Republicans. You know, I had an interesting exchange with James Quincey from Coca-Cola on this. I mean, Coca-Cola is based in Atlanta, Georgia. Quincey himself was one of the people who criticized the the voting rights law that Republicans in Georgia were pushing through, and he got a lot of pushback for that. So in some ways, he's been right at the center of this political pushback. And here's what he had to say about how it's affecting Coke's ESG goals.I have to ask you, because as anyone here who's from the United States knows, we're in the midst of this sort of big political pushback to some of the things you were just saying. You've got a governor of Florida who's apparently going to run his presidential campaign by attacking large corporations, calls your company ""woke-a-cola."" You know, what, what do you make of that political pushback?Quincey: The weaponization of the soundbite is here to stay. And whichever weaponized soundbite works to advance your political agenda is going to happen. And businesses are going to stop using that phrase. ESG becomes toxic as a phrase, which it basically has in the U.S. It doesn't matter to me, I'm just going to stop saying ESG. But the idea that my basic product, I want to be water positive, because my product uses water. I want to have a circular economy on my packaging, because then I don't get beaten up for waste in the sea in the landfill. And the circular package has 90% less carbon in it. And I want to grow business with less sugar. You can call it anything you like. But no one with common sense says those are bad ideas.Murray: So the only change is a semantic one.Quincey: My business strategy is constant and clear and centered around the business and the things that consumers care about and fixes societal problems. If people want to attach labels to it, that's their issue. I'm saying this business will be great if I fix these problems. And it'll be good for the shareholders and it'll be good for society.Murray: You got a lot of nodding heads out there.[Clapping]McGirt: Alan, and the crowd goes wild. Wow. What I really like about where this ended up, is that it clear, it's clear that he steers away from polarizing terms and gets right to the purpose in the heart of the work. And I hope that can be a good tip going forward to be less distracting. I'm always curious about how people are going to benchmark and manage to this but that was a moment, Alan.Murray: Yeah. And he's clearly not alone. I mean, Vas Narasimhan of Novartis said something similar to what you just said about the importance of staying true to the purpose of the company, while you're pursuing benefits for both shareholders and society.Narasimhan: In the end, I think for all of us, we have to be super clear on the purpose and mission of our individual enterprises. Be super clear that when we deliver that purpose and mission, we actually do the biggest thing for ESG, forgetting all of the ESG rating stuff. Doesn't matter, right? If we actually deliver on our missions in a sustainable way, that's supposed to be why our corporations exist. And if we can articulate that, and that's maybe where we're not as good, articulate that clearly to our people, and the public. I hope, over time, we can win back the narrative because actually, in a sense, the whole fact that we have this whole ESG industrial complex means we a little bit lost the narrative. I mean, my company, the best thing we can do is just find medicines and give them to patients around the world. That's the best thing we can do, forgetting all the other stuff. And I'm sure that's true for all of the other companies in this room.McGirt: So Alan, you're a narrative guy. You have been a narrative person for a long time. Do you think companies can win back the narrative? And I'm asking that question specifically thinking about a stakeholder approach. What does that look like now?Murray: Look, we live in an age of skepticism and people are very skeptical when they hear companies or CEOs talk the way that James and Vas did just a minute ago. But the other thing to remember is that while while CEOs may not be fully trusted, they are according to surveys more trusted than government officials, than NGOs, than journalists to be sure. And so, you know, I do think they have an opportunity to win back the narratives and and you have to remember the business leaders are being asked to weigh in on the societal problems in part because government has failed in so many cases. So it's it's a void that they feel a need to fill. Here's what Vas had to say about that.Narasimhan: The underlying challenge is that talent in government has declined precipitously. I mean, talented people don't go into government. And so you have a void because you look up and you don't see government leaders that have the talent and capability that maybe we did a generation ago, I don't know. And people are looking for leaders to step into the void, which is why I think we're asked to comment on social topics, we're asked to comment on all of the various topics, all the CEOs in this room, have been asked to comment on.McGirt: I'm curious. Also, where the need for businesses to fill, governmental or other official voids is specifically an American problem. Your panel included some international perspectives, which is great. Anthony Tan, who we had on Leadership Next way back in 2021, is from Singapore. His app Grab serves millions of users across Southeast Asia. What did he have to say about all of this?Murray: Ellen, I'll tell you, but I should say, first of all, Grab is an amazing story. They operate in eight Southeast Asian countries. They are the leading ride sharing service, the leading fruit food provider, they're turning into kind of an on-the-road bank, financial services for people. So they're one of the super apps that is responding to many of the needs of society. And here's the way he talked about the societal challenge facing his part of the world.Anthony Tan: So the realities are, the legacy of the pandemic has left income inequality into a really bad place, especially in developing countries. And some of us come from there. And I can tell you that when there's an income inequality, there's digital divides, what takes place. Especially in election seasons in a region, we're seeing propaganda, we're seeing hate speech, we're seeing a lot of this polarization takes place. And when polarization takes place, what is most scary, at least for me, is we see extremism rise. And this is taking place. It's not just a Southeast Asian thing. We're seeing it in many places, unfortunately. And that causes actually, real, real social fragility, is causing real issues. So what can we do businesses? So this is a real call to action. I'll say this. I recall, we talked about this just now. You know, in at least for Grab, we think about which groups are vulnerable? Which groups are susceptible to extremism? We said bottom 40, bottom 60%. We said how do we target them? So for Grab, we basically said, anyone who has a motorbike, we'll power you, you do business immediately. Thirty minutes you're on. If you had an app, smartphone, we power you you do business from the sides of the street of Manila, Jakarta, or wherever it is. You start earning money. The best way to fight extremism, is creating rice bowls, is creating economy livelihood, is to create economy inclusion. That is the best way to fight real harsh extremism. And I can say this, it is, at least for me, it is not a just a moral responsibility. It is existential for us. So you know, I honestly believe businesses will fail if society fails.McGirt: That was such a unified field theory vision of what it means to transform a society, right? That was really inspiring. It's not just groceries. It's jobs. It's addressing people who are disconnected and getting ahead of extremism. It's a connecting device. It's really a wonderful way and I love the way he thinks about it and he clearly leads that way.Murray: Yeah, he is an impressive human being, an impressive leader. Ellen, I love going to Davos in January because it really gives me a good sense of what's top of mind for many of these business leaders for the year ahead. But what do you think?McGirt: Well, we need you to keep going and keep doing that so that we can help us with our editorial plans for the year which will not be replaced by a ChatGPT. That's my one of my predictions for this year. I am irreplaceable for 2023. And I do hate predictions but I can't resist them. And here's mine. I really gave this thought. Threats to the economy will compel companies to wobble seriously on their inclusion commitments, including canceling initiatives and laying off talent. In the cases of, you know, entertainment industry giants like HBO, Netflix, even eliminating teams responsible for diverse projects. And we've already seen that starting to happen, expect expect a spate of shareholder challenges to follow on this. But on the flip side, because I know you like good news, I'm predicting, we will see an uptick in diversity in the professional services supply chain, which I think is going to be really important for wealth building. This is more of a wish. But I'm also predicting an uptick in really smart investments in tech and finance and agrotech across Africa, which is going to be really important in the aftermath of food insecurity triggered by the war in Ukraine. And I do expect that political posturing around ESG to continue, but I expect, like you, that the big players will not blink.Murray: I think I agree with all of that. I hope you're wrong about the first prediction, which is the companies will start to back off their DEI commitments. But I have to tell you, what was clear in Davos is that the environmental piece of this, the the moving to net zero 2050 is now kind of baked into the cake. Every company is on board because their customers are doing it, their suppliers are doing it and they feel like they have to do it or they may not exist. I don't think we've reached the same point yet with the DEI commitments. I think it's going to take extra work to get it locked into the business logic. So companies realize if they don't do this, they are going to be letting some of their prime talent go, and they will suffer economically as a result. So I think there's more work to be done on that.McGirt: I absolutely agree with you. That seems exactly right to me.Murray: But I can't wait for the rest of season four. We're going to be back next Tuesday with a new episode.Leadership Next is edited by Alexis Haut.

443,e2ed08e4-a773-3bce-9251-43bf672dbf12,INCY,2023-02-02,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Incyte (INCY),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-why-growth-investors-174505696.html,1675273505,STORY,['INCY'],"[Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Incyte (INCY) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this specialty drugmaker a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Incyte is 58%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 47.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 7.7%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Incyte has an S/TA ratio of 0.64, which means that the company gets $0.64 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.17, it can be said that the company is more efficient.In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Incyte is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 16.1% this year versus the industry average of 15.6%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Incyte. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Incyte a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Incyte is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ROCK recently provided preliminary financial information and updated its GAAP earnings per share guidance for 2022.The company unveiled that it will incur a non-cash charge of $14 million or 35 cents per share, for the fourth quarter. This is to write down assets associated with the processing equipment business, which accounted for 10% of Agtech’s 2021 revenue. The processing equipment business was classified as held for sale as of Mar 31, 2022.Gibraltar now expects GAAP earnings per share in $2.50-$2.60 range, down from the prior estimated range of $2.90-$3.00. The company maintains its revenue and adjusted EPS ranges of $1.38-$1.43 billion and $3.30-$3.40, respectively.ROCK’s chairman and CEO, Bill Bosway, stated, ""The depressed dynamics of the cannabis and hemp processing equipment market led us to pursue a divestiture of these assets. As we continue our efforts to sell this business, we have determined that its estimated fair market value is less than its carrying amount and therefore will be taking a charge to adjust book value to estimated market value. We continue to focus on our core Agtech greenhouse solutions that support our growers in the produce, commercial and cannabis markets.""Shares of this leading manufacturer and distributor of industrial and buildings market products have jumped 4.45% on Jan 31, post news release. The company plans to release its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 22.Gibraltar has been benefiting from strong Residential and Infrastructure businesses. Its focus is on simplifying operations and margin recovery with 80/20 initiatives and business mix. Its revenue projection and adjusted EPS reflects a 3-6.7% and 15.1-22.3% year-over-year rise, respectively.Moreover, adjusted operating income of $150-$155 million is anticipated and adjusted operating margin is likely to be in 10.7-10.9% range. In 2021, adjusted operating income was $127.9 million and the adjusted operating margin was 9.7%. ROCK anticipates adjusted EBITDA of $184–$189 million, reflecting improvement from the year-ago figure of $159.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be 13.1-13.3% versus 12.1% in 2021. The earnings estimate for the quarter-to-be-reported reflects 29.6% growth despite a 3.1% revenue fall.However, the Agtech and Renewables segments have been experiencing supply chain woes and project delays.

Holdings, Inc. MDC reported mixed results for fourth-quarter 2022. Its earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year due to prevailing inflationary woes.Revenues topped the consensus estimate and rose year over year. Shares of this leading homebuilder inched up 1.29% on Jan 31, post earnings release.MDC noted that it experienced a rebound in order activity in December 2022, backed by an aggressive approach to pricing and incentives.Looking forward, MDC's executive chairman, Larry A. Mizel, said, ""As we head into the spring 2023 selling season, we have modified our strategy to focus more on quick move-in inventory as we believe that the majority of today's buyers want a shorter time between sale and close. In addition, we are requiring higher deposit amounts on build-to-order homes. We feel that these initiatives are the right approach for today's new home environment and should lead to better net sales results relative to the second half of 2022.""Earnings &amp; Revenue DiscussionThe company reported quarterly earnings of $1.08 per share, which lagged the consensus estimate of $1.53 by 29.4% and fell 51% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $2.21.

The value of net orders also declined 95% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $74.4 million due to 28% lower ASP of net orders. Cancellations, as a percentage of the beginning backlog, increased 1,590 basis points to 24.6% from 8.7%.

450,0add7273-a4ba-30d7-baf0-e41dd7f8ea2a,INTU,2023-02-02,The 7 Best Growth Stocks for the Next 5 Years,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-growth-stocks-next-162133142.html,1675009293,STORY,"['ENPH', 'NVDA', 'GOOGL', 'ASML', 'INTU', 'AN']","[While it’s too early to tell if the current bull run will last, investors with a long-term time horizon may want to consider the best growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. For one thing, if you are the optimistic type, the latest news should bolster broader sentiments. For one, President Biden touted the U.S. economy’s 2.9% annual growth rate in the fourth quarter.Two, even if 2023 ends up being a dud, at some point, the economy should gain its footing. For instance, one notable difference between current events and the factors leading up to the Great Recession is that nearly half of homes were equity rich last year. While this circumstance may change, people may have learned the harsh lessons of years past. Finally, societies always push forward, irrespective of ongoing challenges. Therefore, investors may want to pay close attention to the below best growth stocks to buy for the next half-decade.ASMLASML.$667.39GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$100.71NVDANvidia$203.65INTUIntuit$422.62ANAutoNation$121.38ENPHEnphase Energy$210.09ROVRRover Group$3.85InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsASML (ASML)Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboardSource: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockFocused on producing the lithography machines that undergird the world’s most advanced chips, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) represents one of the most important companies ever. That’s reason number one to rank it among the best growth stocks to buy. Another catalyst, though, stems from management’s upgraded sales guidance for 2023, anticipating a 25% jump. As things stand, ASML represents an overall solid enterprise for growth and earnings. Per data from Gurufocus.com, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 20.9%, beating out nearly 75% of the competition. As well, its free cash flow growth rate during the same period pings at 61.1%, outpacing over 85% of its peers.On the bottom line, ASML features a net margin of 27.5%, along with a return on equity of a staggering 58.9%, reflecting an extremely high-quality business. To be fair, it’s not the cheapest name out there with a trailing multiple of over 46. Still, given the relevancy and otherwise strong financials, ASML is one of the best growth stocks to buy.Story continuesAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comThe events of 2022 – soaring inflation, geopolitical flashpoints, digital advertising erosion – didn’t bode well for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and its Google ecosystem. Thus, it wasn’t terribly shocking to see the GOOG Class C shares tumble over 23% in the trailing year. Nevertheless, it could rank among the best growth stocks to buy because of its extraordinary relevance. Personally, I don’t think it’s a coincidence that GOOG gained almost 11% of equity value in the year so far. When people do anything on the Internet, they go to Google. That much is obvious when you consider its 92.58% global market share of the search engine industry. Unless you anticipate another competitor stealing Google’s fire, GOOG stock should be reasonably reliable.As well, despite last year’s turmoil, Alphabet remains a growth machine. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 25%, above 75% of sector players. Also, its FCF growth rate during the same period pinged at 45%, outpacing 80% of the field. As a long-term idea, GOOG easily ranks among the best growth stocks to buy.Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAlthough a consistently-relevant player in the broader technology sphere, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently absorbed more cyclical volatility. A leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), these components not only accelerate gaming protocols, they also undergird blockchain-mining enterprises. Therefore, when the cryptocurrency complex soared in 2021, it helped spark dramatic upside for NVDA. At the time, Nvidia unquestionably stood among the best growth stocks to buy. However, when circumstances soared on cryptos, the digital asset market sunk NVDA in its wake. In the trailing year, NVDA still slipped below nearly 10% below parity. However, circumstances look much better this year, with shares gaining over 38% of equity value.Yes, cryptos regained their moxie (for now). However, Nvidia represents an ever-competitive innovator, driving its expansionary ambitions. In the past three years, the company’s sales growth rate pinged at 31.3%, outpacing over 89% of its peers. Also, Wall Street analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy.Intuit (INTU)Stacks of coins hold up wooden blocks that spell out ""TAX."" FairTaxSource: ShutterstockTax and accounting software provider Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) might appear boring. To be completely fair, it is – painfully so. However, it’s also incredibly relevant, more than justifying its inclusion on this list of best growth stocks to buy. Fundamentally, as the workplace gradually pivots toward pre-pandemic norms, the gig economy may rise to prominence. If so, Intuit will provide a valuable service.According to analysts from Industry Research, the gig economy may reach a valuation of $873 billion by 2027. That’s only four years away. While outside observers go nuts for the sector’s projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.18% from 2022, it’s important to recognize the mundane details. Specifically, former employees that decide to go independent will fall under a different tax structure.Essentially, the IRS treats gig workers (or independent contractors) as business enterprises, meaning they must file more complex tax forms, like profit and income statements. It can be daunting for first-time gig workers. Therefore, Intuit enjoys significant relevance, making it one of the best growth stocks to buy.AutoNation (AN)assortment of cars in a parking lot representing GETR stock.Source: ShutterstockAt first glance, AutoNation (NYSE:AN) doesn’t seem like one of the best growth stocks to buy. If anything, outside fundamentals such as soaring inflation and the resultant interest rate hikes makes car buying a difficult proposition. Therefore, auto dealerships such as AutoNation might suffer. However, that’s not what the data suggests. In the trailing year, AN gained over 12% of equity value. Since the Jan. opener, the stock’s closing in on 10%. At the most elemental level, personal vehicles represent necessities. True, some folks go overboard, buying more car than they can afford. Still, for the vast majority (particularly for west coast residents), a car is a critical asset.Now, if you’re focused on the best growth stocks to buy over the next five years, AN offers an ideal profile. Basically, the cars on the road today already carry a record average age of 12.2 years. Over the next half-decade, you’ll see more breakdowns. Cynically, this will force consumers into used-car auto dealerships.Enphase Energy (ENPH)Solar penny stocks: a close up of a solar cell farmSource: Fit Ztudio / ShutterstockAdmittedly, Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) presents some difficulties regarding the best growth stocks to buy. While ENPH gained over 73% of equity value during the trailing year, that’s also the problem. It’s so hot, meaning that it’s possible ENPH is due for a cool down. Plus, other overlooked trades may have their year in 2023.It’s a fair point. No one wants to hold the bag. However, Enphase’s solar energy solutions – particularly its battery storage system – will speak to residents who have suffered blackouts. Further, if we continue to encounter unusually warm summer seasons, the blackouts may worsen. Therefore, well-to-do households will almost surely seek energy resilience platforms, boding well for Enphase. Appropriately for the best growth stocks to buy, that’s exactly what undergirds ENPH. Per Gurufocus.com, Enphase’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 45%, beating out nearly 95% of its peers. As well, it features solid profitability metrics, excellent ROE and a decent balance sheet.Rover Group (ROVR)a puppy and a kitten sniggling together. represents pet stocksSource: ShutterstockAs stated earlier, one of the biggest developments on the horizon centers on the gig economy. Organically, this circumstance augurs well for Rover Group (NASDAQ:ROVR). Connecting dog owners with individuals that provide dog-related services such as pet sitting, boarding and walking, Rover’s online marketplace should generate much interest. After all, Americans love their pets.Now, during the lockdowns, pet owners had all the time in the world to take care of their four-legged friends. However, with major enterprises putting an end to remote work, it’s likely that over time, the workplace will fully normalize. Unfortunately, this puts recalled workers with pets in a bind. However, Rover can help, giving owners greater peace of mind.For transparency’s sake, if you consider the broader financials for Rover, some viability concerns exist. However, ROVR features a consensus strong buy view from Wall Street analysts. Also, their average price target of $5.94 implies upside potential of over 58%. That makes ROVR one of the best growth stocks to buy over the next five years.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

My name is Tanya, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.Kevin Lobo: Welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Jason Beach, Vice President of Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Jason with the trends we saw during the quarter, Mako performance insights and updates on Vocera and Wright Medical. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results and 2023 guidance before we open the call to Q&amp;A. I will begin with the macroeconomic environment. 2022 was a year where we, alongside many companies, faced unprecedented supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures. We faced these challenges and delivered for over 130 million patients and for our customers all over the world.We also remain focused on the future, as we progress our pipeline of innovation, enabling a super cycle of new product launches across our portfolio in 2023 and 2024. I want to thank our 50,000 employees for their unrelenting determination and agility. In the fourth quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 13.2%, which brought our full year organic sales growth to 9.7%. During my 10-plus years in this role, these were record quarterly and annual growth rates. The growth was balanced across our businesses and regions in implants, disposables and capital equipment, and was highlighted by our Medical division, which had Q4 organic sales growth of over 25%. Additionally, for the fifth consecutive year, our international organic growth rate exceeded our U.S. growth rate, demonstrating the progress we are making on globalization.Story continuesThis was highlighted by Europe, Canada, Australia and emerging markets, which all posted double-digit growth in the quarter. International growth remains a significant opportunity in the years ahead that should continue to complement our strong U.S. business. Next, we delivered quarterly and full year adjusted EPS of $3 and $9.34, respectively, exceeding our latest guidance range. This was driven by our strong sales performance, which offset inflationary pressures and negative foreign currency. Also, we are progressing with our actions to address higher costs, which include both pricing and targeted restructuring plans. We have begun to see the impact of these initiatives and expect an improving trend over the course of 2023. We also expect the positive trends in procedural recovery to continue alongside strong demand for capital products.And while component availability will continue to be variable in 2023, we do expect that it will gradually improve throughout the year, lessening the need for spot buys. We will remain disciplined with our spend and we will continue to invest in innovation, including potential tuck-in M&amp;A. We remain confident in the outlook of our business and expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech, which is reflected in our full year 2023 guidance of organic sales growth of 7% to 8.5%. This growth combined with the continued challenging macro emit environment, our pricing and cost actions will translate to an adjusted EPS of $9.85 per share to $10.15 per share. I will now turn the call over to Jason.Jason Beach: Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on the current environment, as well as Mako, Vocera and Wright Medical. Procedural volumes continue to recover throughout the fourth quarter in most countries. Parts of Asia-Pacific, however, have continued to be more volatile due to ongoing COVID-related impacts. While volumes are recovering, hospital staffing pressures have continued in pockets around the globe and patient backlog remains. As mentioned on the Q3 call, these challenges will likely resolve gradually and we continue to expect this will be a moderate tailwind as we move through 2023. Additionally, demand for our capital products remained very healthy in the quarter, as seen from the double-digit organic growth of our Medical, Endoscopy and Instruments divisions.Even considering our finish, we exited the year with a very strong order book. Next, specific to Mako, we had a record quarter of installations in both the U.S. and internationally. We continue to be agnostic to the form these deals take and will continue to offer flexible options for our customers to acquire capital equipment. The great progress of our Mako offense has resulted in strong growth of our installed base alongside continued increases in utilization. In the U.S., we saw approximately 55% of knees and almost 30% of hips performed using Mako in the quarter. Also, in December, we surpassed our 1 million cementless knee procedure with cementless knees continuing to index higher in make accounts. So in addition to being the leader in robotic-assisted surgery, we are also well ahead on cementless knee adoption.Finally, we are making good progress with the development of our Mako spine and shoulder applications, and expect to have the initial launch of spine in the back half of 2024 and the initial shoulder launch at the end of 2024. Now to our key acquisition and integration activities, our Vocera integration continues to progress well, and as a reminder, we will anniversary in February of this year. Q4 results were consistent with our commentary on the last earnings call, as is the expected sales ramp beginning in Q2 of this year. Turning the page to Wright Medical, we have now passed the two-year mark of the integration of Wright Medical. This has been our largest acquisition to-date. Now complete, we have exceeded expectations on both our sales and synergy assumptions, as the cultural fit was strong and we implemented our integration playbook very effectively.Hospital, Diagnosis, TreatmentPhoto by Marcel Scholte on UnsplashAdditionally, it was a catalyst that drove the creation of three separate business units, allowing us to serve unique customers across core trauma, upper extremities and foot and ankle. All three businesses exited the year with terrific momentum and strong R&amp;D pipelines. Overall, this acquisition has proven to be a great success and we are excited about what the future holds. With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn.Glenn Boehnlein: Thanks, Jason. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. Our organic sales growth was 13.2% in the quarter. The fourth quarter's average selling days were in line with 2021. The impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable by 0.6%. We continue to see a positive trend from our pricing initiatives, particularly in our U.S. MedSurg businesses, which all contributed positive pricing for the quarter. Foreign currency had a 3.8% unfavorable impact on sales, the supply chain disruption somewhat lessened during the quarter and our capital order book continues to be very robust as demand from our customers remains strong.In the quarter, U.S. organic sales growth was 11.2%. International organic sales growth was 18.3%, impacted by positive sales momentum across most of our international markets. For the year, organic sales growth was 9.7% with U.S. organic sales growth of 8.9% and international organic growth of 11.7%. The impact from pricing in the year was unfavorable by 0.9% and 2022 had the same number of selling days as 2021. Our adjusted EPS of $3 in the quarter was up 10.7% from 2021, driven by higher sales and strict cost discipline, partially offset by inflationary pressures and the impact of foreign currency exchange translation, which was unfavorable $0.16. Our full year adjusted EPS was $9.34, which represents growth of 2.8% from full year 2021, reflecting the favorable impact of sales growth, lower net interest costs and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by inflationary pressures and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange translation of $0.31.Now I will provide some highlights around our quarterly segment performance. In the quarter, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had constant currency sales growth of 19.3%, with organic sales growth of 16.9%, which included 14.9% of U.S. organic growth and 22.5% of international organic growth. Instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 11.7%, led by double-digit growth in the Surgical Technology business. From a product perspective, sales growth was led by power tools, Steri-Shield, waste management and smoke evacuation. Endoscopy had U.S. organic sales growth of 9.7%, highlighted by strong growth in sports medicine, communications, video, general surgery and ProCare. Medical had U.S. organic sales growth of 22.9%, driven by our emergency care and acute businesses.The growth was fueled by double-digit growth across our emergency care and Prime Structure businesses, and also benefited from improvement in product supply throughout the quarter. Our U.S. Neurovascular business had organic sales growth of 1.5%, driven by continued market softness and competitive pressures. The U.S. Neurocranial business had impressive organic growth of 19.7%, which included double-digit growth in our Sonopet iQ, Signature High Speed Drills, silver glide bipolar forceps and Max space Neuro product lines. Internationally, MedSurg and Neurotechnology had organic sales growth of 22.5%, reflecting double-digit growth in all businesses. Geographically, this included strong performances in Europe, Australia and emerging markets.Orthopedics and Spine had constant currency sales growth of 8.3% with organic sales growth of 8.4%, which included organic growth of 6.2% in the U.S. and 13.6% internationally. Our U.S. hip business grew 11.3% organically, reflecting strong primary hip growth fueled by the recent launch of our Insignia Hip Stem, the ongoing success of the Mako THA 4.1 software upgrade and continued procedural growth. Our U.S. knee business grew 7.8% organically against a very strong Q4 2022 comparable of over 14%. This reflects our market-leading position in robotic-assisted knee procedures. Our U.S. Trauma and Extremities business grew 11.9% organically with strong performances across all three businesses, led by double-digit growth in upper extremities and foot and ankle, and strong performances in plating and nailing.Our U.S. Spine business grew 0.5%, led by performance in our enabling technology business, including the recently launched Q Guidance navigation system. U.S. Other Ortho declined organically by 18.7%, primarily driven by the impact of deal mix changes, specifically more rentals related to Mako installations in the quarter. Internationally, Orthopaedics and Spine grew 13.6% organically, which reflects strong performances in Europe, Australia, Canada and India. Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 62.7% was unfavorable, approximately 310 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2021 and in line with Q3 2022, reflecting the impact of the purchases of electronic components at premium prices and other inflationary pressures primarily related to labor, steel and transportation costs, and unfavorable business mix.Adjusted R&amp;D spending was 5.5% of sales, which represents a 90-basis-point decrease from the fourth quarter of 2021. Full year adjusted R&amp;D spending was 6.7% of sales, which was slightly higher than our 2021 adjusted R&amp;D spending of 6.6% of sales. Our adjusted SG&amp;A was 30.6% of sales, which was 150 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2021. This reflects the impact of increased focus on discretionary cost control and headcount discipline. In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 26.6% of sales, which was approximately 70 basis points unfavorable to the fourth quarter of 2021. This performance is primarily driven by the aforementioned inflationary pressures, primarily on gross margin and the negative impact, resulting from foreign currency exchange translation, somewhat offset by cost discipline.Other income and expense of $53 million for the quarter decreased from 2021, primarily due to net favorable interest income. For 2023, we expect a quarterly run rate of $65 million for other income and expense. Our fourth quarter and full year had an adjusted effective tax rate of 13.8% and 14%, respectively, reflecting the impact of geographic mix and certain discrete tax items. For 2023, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%. Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with $1.9 billion of cash and marketable securities, and total debt of $13 billion. Approximately $150 million of term loan debt was paid down in the quarter, which brings our year-to-date payments to $650 million. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations is $2.6 billion.This performance reflects the results of net earnings, partially offset by lower accounts receivable collections due to higher sales at the end of the year, the impact of higher costs for certain electronic components and pre-buying of certain other critical raw material inventory during the year. For 2023, we anticipate that capital spending will be approximately $600 million. Again, in 2023, we do not plan to do any share buybacks and we will continue to focus on further debt reduction. And now I will provide 2023 full year sales and earnings guidance. As we assess the current operating environment, we believe that there will continue to be macroeconomic volatility, including supply chain constraints, recession and inflationary risks and currency fluctuations.Despite this environment, we have positive momentum in many parts of our business heading into 2023, including continued procedural recovery, many new product introductions and a very robust order book for our capital products. Given the above, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 7% to 8.5% for the full year 2023 when compared to 2022. There are the same number of selling days in 2023 compared to 2022, with one extra day in Q1 and one less day in Q3. Based on the steady progress of our pricing actions, we would expect the full year impact of price to be between zero percent and minus 0.5%. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales and EPS will be modestly unfavorably impacted for the full year, being more negative in the first half of the year.This is included in our guidance. While we are not specifically guiding the quarters, keep in mind that as you compare the first quarter to the prior year quarter, Q1 2022 did not have the inflationary pressures that we are now experiencing. So despite a strong growth outlook, we do not expect Q1 EPS to be much better than Q1 2022. Finally, for the full year 2023, we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.85 to $10.15, representing a return to op margin expansion. This guidance range assumes a gradual improvement of the global operating environment, including a progressive easing of supply chain disruptions throughout the year. And now, I will open up the call for Q&amp;A.See also 13 Cheap New Stocks To Buy and 10 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

The company expects organic growth for total revenues to be 7-8.5% compared with 2022. It expects the good momentum to continue into 2023.

The company witnessed strong performance across the segments in the United States. International sales also improved on the back of strong performances in Europe, Canada, Australia and emerging markets.Per management, the company continues to face supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures. Moreover, ongoing negative foreign currency values are a concern. Stryker is taking action to lessen the negative price impact. It is also taking several cost-cutting initiatives, including restructuring plans. Stryker’s prospects in 2023 seem promising on the back of strong customer demand for its existing products as well as new launches. The company’s revenue and EPS guidance seems encouraging. Strong quarterly results and bright outlook for 2023 are likely to have swayed investors to drive Stryker’s share price up by 4.4% during after-hours trading on Jan 31.

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Korey Thomas.Korey Thomas: Thank you and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 conference call. Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with a presentation available on the Investors section of our website at wolffilcorp.com. Before we begin, I want to remind you that as we conduct this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements to assist you in better understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K, 10-Q and other periodic reports. We also want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures.We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the presentation and supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants to ask no more than two questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.Marc Bitzer: Thanks, Korey and good morning, everyone. Turning to our agenda on Slide 4. I will preview what we will discuss today. Two weeks ago, we announced the conclusion of a strategic review of EMEA alongside preliminary 2022 results and a preview of our '23 expectations. This morning, we will provide additional context on each, starting with our '22 results. And during the second half of 2022, we were in the midst of an unfavorable macro cycle. A short-term consumer sentiment and demand continued to reflect recessionary concerns. At the same time, inflationary pressures remained stubbornly high. While the combination of demand down, cost up is historically rather unusual for it best temporary it did impact our results negatively during Q4.Story continuesIn addition, our supply chain execution was not where we expected it to be in the fourth quarter. This was due to a one-off supply issue that has since been resolved but negatively impacted a number of our North American factories. Jim will provide more information on 2022 later in the call. Looking ahead into 2023, we do expect the tail end of this negative macro cycle to be felt during the first few months of the year. We foresee macro headwinds to slowly turn into tailwinds as the year progresses. Needless to say that it is difficult to predict the exact timing of the shift in the macro cycle but we would expect this to happen towards late Q2 or early Q3. Given this volatility, we remain relentlessly focused on the business levers which we can control.And we are fully confident that the medium-term demand drivers of our business remain intact. Our operational priorities in 2023 will be flawless execution of our supply chain and the delivery of very significant cost targets. After 2 years of inflationary cost increases, we will deliver $800 million to $900 million of total cost takeout. We have a high degree of confidence in delivering this target. Looking back on our history, Whirlpool has a strong record of successfully managing for challenging cycles and delivering substantial cost reductions. In 2007, we expected $400 million of raw material inflation as we entered the year. We responded to this high level of cost inflation with early and decisive actions delivering record results. In 2011 and 2012, we reduced our fixed cost in North America by more than $400 million.More importantly, we're not just starting this new cost initiative in January 2023. As mentioned in our prior earnings calls, we have initiated this during the second half of 2022. As a result, the maturity of the underlying actions has advanced significantly, thus giving us a high degree of confidence in the delivery of cost targets. Now turning to Slide 5. I will provide an update on our strategic review of EMEA and our portfolio transformation. I am very happy with the EMEA transaction its value creation and how it fits into the broader context of Whirlpool's portfolio transformation that we have been discussing. In April of 2022, we outlined how we would continue our multiyear journey of transforming Wolford into a high-growth, high-margin business.Let me first remind you why we are transforming our portfolio. As we sit here today, we are operating in a very different world than we were just 10 or 20 years ago. It is a less global world. Global scale was significant in the past but we're now experiencing diminishing advantages of that. The benefits from regional and local scale have become even more apparent and compelling. At the same time, Whirlpool has raised the bar for long-term value creation. It is with this mindset that we critically assess ourselves and we are focused on transforming our portfolio into a high-margin, high-growth business. Recent actions include adding to our already strong brand portfolio and agreeing to contribute our European major domestic appliance business into a newly formed entity with Arcelik.As you can see, the portfolio transformation is ongoing and we have made significant progress. I'm confident these actions have us well positioned to delivering growing shareholder value over time. As a reminder, as a result of our transactions we executed in 2022, we will see an increase in free cash flow of approximately $350 million in 2024. Now turning to Slide 6, I will share more about the strategic review of our EMEA business. We assessed a range of options with a goal of maximizing value for our shareholders, employees and consumers. We are pleased with the outcome of an agreement to contribute our European major domestic appliance business to a newly formed European appliance entity with Arcelik. Arcelik is a company where we know well, having executed a number of transactions with them.Our consumers will benefit from broad product and service offerings as we bring together the best of the best innovation, attractive brands and sustainable manufacturing. We will own approximately 25% of a new company and we expect the transaction to close during the second half of 2023, subject to regulatory approvals. The new company is expected to have over €6 billion of annual sales with over €200 million of cost, synergies. It is important to note that we are retaining our ownership of our EMEA KitchenAid business. Our global KitchenAid Small Appliance business is 1 of the 3 strong pillars of our value-creating business model with a structurally attractive margin profile. Turning to Slide 7, I will discuss our value creation expectations from the actions we have taken in the EMEA region.We expect to participate in the significant efficiency the new company will generate, including sustained productivity building upon already established purchasing capabilities and continued commitment to product design, innovation and sustainability. We have a potential to unlock long-term value creation for our ability to monetize our minority interest at an estimated net present value of $500 million. Even though we envision a long-term profitable relationship with Arcelik, a shareholder agreement includes a number of exit options at predetermined parameters after 5 years. Our 40-year Whirlpool brand licensing agreement will generate predictable cash flows of more than $20 million per year. Overall, we expect $750 million net present value of future cash flows.Separately, through the previously executed divestiture of our Russia business, we continue to expect up to $260 million of deferred payments. Now, I'll turn it over to Jim to review our fourth quarter results.Jim Peters: Thanks, Mark and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9. Our fourth quarter performance was impacted by a one-off supply chain disruption in North America and elevated cost inflation. Despite this, I want to highlight that our previously initiated cost actions remain on track. Additionally, raw material costs remain elevated but we are beginning to see improvement. In the fourth quarter, we delivered ongoing EPS of $3.89 and ongoing margins of 3.5% as results benefited from a full year adjusted effective tax rate of 4%. Turning to Slide 10. I'll review results for our North America region. As expected, the inflationary environment and increasing interest rates continue to weigh on demand and cost-based pricing actions partially offset elevated cost inflation.Our production volumes were impacted by approximately 5% due to a one-off supply chain disruption as mentioned before. This disruption involves one critical supplier providing a common platform of parts for multiple manufacturing locations and products and was resolved in mid-January. This disruption also negatively impacted price mix as we had previously committed investments in anticipation of value-creating holiday promotions. Given the confidential nature of the ongoing discussions with the supplier we will not share any additional information about this situation. Even with the supply challenges faced in the quarter, we successfully maintained our recent sequential quarterly share gains. We are confident that the actions we put in place have us positioned to win and we remain confident in the structural strength of our North America business.Turning to Slide 11. I'll review our results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and the divested Whirlpool Russia business, fourth quarter revenue was down approximately 9%. The region delivered breakeven EBIT margins during the quarter as cost-based pricing actions offset lower volumes and cost inflation. And as Marc mentioned, we completed our strategic review of EMEA. Until the close of the transaction, EMEA's performance will continue to be included in our ongoing results. Turning to Slide 12. I'll review results for our Latin America region. The region saw demand declines that were moderate compared to the steep declines experienced during the third quarter. The region's cost-based pricing and strong cost actions resulted in flat revenue and solid EBIT margins for the quarter.Turning to Slide 13. I'll review results for our Asia region. On a full year basis, excluding the China business and the impact of foreign currency, revenue grew by approximately 5%. Cost-based pricing actions were more than offset by weaker demand and continued cost inflation resulting in an EBIT margin of 2.7%. Now, I'll turn it over to Marc to discuss our perspective on 2023.Marc Bitzer: Thanks, Jim. Turning to Slide 15. I will share how we expect the current operating environment marked by softer demand and still elevated but easing costs to impact 2023. As we enter the new year, we continue to expect consumer sentiment to negatively impact demand. This is expected to be more pronounced at the beginning of the year, the first half demand to be down by 5% to 10%. And we expect demand will improve each quarter and to exit 2023 with flat industry volumes. We strongly believe in the favorable mid- and long-term demand tailwinds in particular in North America. The undersupplied aging housing stock is the oldest it has ever been and we expect this will drive new construction demand in the mid- to long term.In the short term, the sharp increase in mortgage rates has suppressed existing home sales but consumer equity remains very strong. As a result, we do expect a sustained high level of remodeling activities in the home and the kitchen in particular. Putting it differently, in the short term, consumers may be reluctant to buy a new house but they will use the strong balance sheet to remodel their home. From a go-to-market perspective, we expect 2023 promotional activity to be at similar levels as the second half of 2022. Also looking to the second half of 2023, we continue to expect the promotional environment to remain below pre-pandemic levels. From a raw materials perspective, we see raw material costs easing throughout the year. Steel spot rates have come down significantly and we have started seeing the benefits of this in our annual contracts.We also see improvements in resins and ocean freight. At the same time, there are still a number of commodities such as nickel and strategic components where we are faced with persistent high cost levels. Turning to Slide 16. Our 2023 operational priorities are clear. First, we aim for flawless execution of our supply chain. And let me start out by stating a flawless execution is easier said than done. Our supply chain model has served us very well over many decades but it is a cost efficiency driven supply chain model characterized by long transportation lanes from low-cost countries, a high degree of parts complexity and high percentage of single sourcing. This historic supply chain model is cost efficient but has not been resilient enough to cope with the unprecedented COVID-related volatility and disruptions.Over the past 2 years, we have reduced our parts complexity from well over 110,000 active parts to slightly more than 70,000 active parts. In the midterm, we do see a path to drive this number to well below 50,000 parts. At the same time, we significantly expanded our dual sourcing from single sourcing. We put our priority on high-value strategic parts and components and have come a long way in derisking this part of our supply chain but we still have a tail end of lower-value parts that are single source. This will be our focus in the coming months and years. As mentioned before, our second operational priority is a cost reduction of $800 million to $900 million. We expect to deliver $500 million in net cost takeout actions by removing over $250 million of premium costs and inefficiencies from our supply chain operations and continuing to be disciplined in our discretionary spending and headcount management.Compared to the summer of 2022, our current global salaried workforce is already down by 4% and we will remain very disciplined throughout 2023. In addition to these net cost takeout actions, we do expect $300 million to $400 million in raw material cost reductions adding up to $800 million to $900 million total cost target. As you look at the seasonality of this cost reduction, you will note that it is more skewed towards the second half of 2023. There are 3 factors explaining the seasonality which specifically impacts Q1. First, it's important to remember where we have higher cost inventory as we enter 2023, creating a lagging effect of easing raw materials. Putting it differently, even though costs are coming down because of inventory, it normally takes about 2 months to see this fully reflected in our P&amp;L.AppliancesPhoto by Clayton on UnsplashSecond, we're lapping periods of lower year-over-year inflation as cost increases peaked in the third quarter of 2022. Third, as you may recall, we have a variety of material contract lanes with quarterly and annual durations which creates somewhat of a lack. Now with many of our annual contract negotiations now complete, we have line of sight to deliver $300 million to $400 million of raw material cost benefit in 2023. Now, I'll turn it over to Jim to discuss our full year 2023 guidance on Slide 17.Jim Peters: Thanks, Marc. I'll review our full year 2023 guidance. In 2023, we expect a revenue decline of 1% to 2%, given softer consumer demand and sentiment, most notably in North America and EMEA, especially as the first half of 2023 continues to reflect the current macro cycles. As we reset our cost structure, we expect to expand ongoing EBIT margins to approximately 7.5% and deliver approximately $800 million in free cash flow. Our free cash flow delivery could be significantly impacted by the timing of the close of the EMEA transaction alongside the seasonality of cash generation from the region. We expect our ongoing tax rate to be 14% to 16% and our interest cost to be approximately $325 million which reflects the incremental debt from the Insyncrator acquisition.This represents a full year ongoing EPS range of $16 to $18. Turning to Slide 18. We show the drivers of our full year ongoing EBIT margin guidance. We expect price/mix to be negatively impacted by 225 basis points. As our availability improves, we expect to participate in value-creating promotions partially offset by positive mix driven by a strong lineup of new product introductions. Next, as we execute $500 million of strong cost takeout actions throughout the year, alongside raw material benefits, we expect a positive 425 basis point impact to margins. Continued investments in marketing and technology alongside currency headwinds are expected to negatively impact margins by 125 basis points. As we navigate temporary demand declines, an easing inflationary environment and execute our decisive cost takeout actions, we expect to deliver approximately 35% to 40% of our earnings in the first half of the year.We are confident that we have the right actions in place to navigate this macro environment and deliver approximately 7.5% EBIT margins. Turning to Slide 19, we show our regional guidance for the year. Starting with industry demand, we expect most of our regions to continue to be impacted by a subdued demand environment, particularly during the first part of the year as consumer sentiment is still impacted by the macro environment. In North America and EMEA, we expect a contraction of 4% to 6%. And in Latin America, we expect a contraction of 1% to 3%. In Asia, we expect industry to accelerate by 2% to 4%. Despite the expected declines, we expect industry volumes, particularly in North America, to be approximately 6% above 2019 levels. We expect EBIT margin expansion across all regions, driven by our strong cost takeout actions as well as raw material inflation tailwinds.In North America, we expect to deliver full year margins of approximately 12%, with the region exiting the year with margins of approximately 14%. We expect EMEA to deliver approximately 2.5% margins. In Latin America, we expect to deliver EBIT margins of approximately 7% as cost takeout actions are partially offset by continued macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility impacting demand. Lastly, we expect EBIT margins of approximately 5.5% in Asia, driven by top line growth and strong cost takeout actions. Now turning to Slide 20. I'll discuss our capital allocation priorities which remain unchanged. We have invested over $5 billion in capital expenditures and research and development over the last 5 years, reflecting our commitment to deliver a high-growth, high-margin business.During that same time period, we have returned over $5 billion cash to shareholders, including $900 million of buybacks in 2022 and a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend, representing the tenth straight year of dividend increases and nearly the 70th consecutive year of paying dividends. The continued strength of our balance sheet with $2 billion of cash at the end of the year, has given us the flexibility and optionality to pursue value-creating opportunities like the acquisition of InSinkErator in 2022. In 2023, we are prioritizing debt repayment driving an optimal capital structure and maintaining our strong investment-grade credit rating. Now, I'll turn the call over to Marc.Marc Bitzer: Thanks, Jim. Turning to Slide 21. Let me close with a few remarks. In our 111-year history, we have built a proven track record of successfully operating through challenging macro cycles and we're confident in our ability to deliver margin expansion in 2023. We will flawlessly execute on our supply chain initiatives, while our reset cost structure is expected to deliver $800 million to $900 million of benefit. In addition to these actions, the ongoing portfolio transformation will unlock value and enhance our financial profile. With the addition of incinerator and the MEA divestiture, we expect to deliver approximately $350 million of incremental free cash flow in 2024. The MEA transaction alone is expected to deliver a 200 basis point improvement to return on invested capital.along at a 150 basis point improvement in ongoing EBIT margin. These improvements, coupled with a healthy balance sheet of a foundation of our firm commitment to returning cash to shareholders. Let me remind you 2022 represents our tenth consecutive year of dividend increases with a 25% increase to our quarterly dividend. Additionally, we repurchased $900 million in shares, returning a total of $1.3 billion in cash to our shareholders. Also, in the future, we will continue to maintain a solid balance sheet while providing attractive returns to our shareholders. We are well positioned competitively, seeing favorable market share trends and will continue to benefit from long-term demand tailwinds to our industry. Now, we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions.See also 12 Best Performing Cybersecurity Stocks and 15 Cheapest New Cars for 2023.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

LYB is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings before the opening bell on Feb 2.The company surpassed Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters while missing it twice, the average earnings surprise being a negative 5%. It posted a negative earnings surprise of 33.8% in the last reported quarter.LYB's fourth-quarter results are likely to reflect soft seasonal demand, weaker volumes and elevated input cost inflation across its segments.The stock has lost 3.6% in the past year against the industry’s rise of 2.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $10,434 million, which suggests a decline of 18.7% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Olefins and Polyolefins – Americas division’s revenues is currently pegged at $2,858 million, implying a decline of 28.8% year over year.The consensus estimate for the Olefins and Polyolefins – Europe, Asia &amp; International division’s revenues currently stands at $2,236 million, indicating a decline of 36.7% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of LYB’s Advanced Polymer Solutions segment for the fourth quarter is $1,201 million, suggesting a decline of 4.2%.The consensus estimate for its Intermediaries and Derivatives segment is currently pegged at $2,936 million, which implies a 0.1% rise from the prior year’s levels. The same for LYB’s Refining segment is $2,924 million, suggesting a rise of 10.6%. The consensus estimate for its Technology segment stands at $168 million, which indicates a 34.6% decline from the year-ago reported figure.Some Factors to WatchLYB’s fourth-quarter earnings are likely to reflect higher feedstock, energy costs and demand pressures, which are expected to have weighed in on its margins. Weaker seasonal demand and volatile energy costs might have hurt the company’s performance in the fourth quarter in its Europe and Americas businesses.  However, styrene margins in the Intermediates and Derivatives segment are likely to have seen improvement due to lower feedstock costs. Oxyfuel margins are likely to have remained under pressure due to weak demand. Also, slight improvements in the automotive end market are expected to have provided support to the Advanced Polymers Solution segment. But elevated feedstock and energy costs might have weighed on margins in this segment.

For more companies, head on over to Top 5 Smartest Companies To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Surviving in the modern day corporate world is not for the faint of heart. Business is a ruthless endeavor, and shareholder and investor interest reign supreme for each company. The companies that have survived, and have turned into modern day giants and/or disrupted industries are ones that have beaten the competition by introducing unique products and services and capturing consumer attention through marketing campaigns. America, which has the largest and most developed corporate sector in the world (even the universe maybe, unless NASA finds aliens), is full of companies that disrupted industries and become corporate giants — even closing in on the African continent's GDP when it comes to market capitalization. Africa's nominal GDP is slated to be $3.14 trillion by 2023 according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), while the two most valuable American firms — Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) — have a combined market capitalization of $4.16 trillion.Both have led the charge and transformed entire industries. For Apple, its biggest strength is the manufacturing supply chain that enables it to pump out millions of iPhones each year. For Microsoft,  it has been the ability to target the highest growing industries and become a dominant player in them. The best example of this is the Azure cloud computing and data center platform, which grew 40% on a YoY basis in the second quarter of 2022.Marcin Balcerzak/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has taken a wager at trying to identify the smartest companies in the world.

468,53a12f0a-8200-3555-a1bd-ab4d2cb0eaae,VLO,2023-02-02,Investors Heavily Search Valero Energy Corporation (VLO): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-valero-energy-140002738.html,1675260002,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy (VLO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this oil refiner have returned +16.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Valero Energy falls in, has lost 1.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $6.65 per share, indicating a change of +187.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +37.5% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.10 points to a change of -20.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +27.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.48 indicates a change of -28.7% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +47.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Valero Energy is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $33.58 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -12.9%. The $148.81 billion and $136.66 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -15.6% and -8.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $41.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.3%. EPS of $8.45 for the same period compares with $2.47 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.04%. The EPS surprise was +13.42%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and Valero Energy (VLO) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 16.7% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this oil refiner well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. VLO meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 5.9% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for VLO is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.64. This indicates that the stock moves 64% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that VLO has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped VLO earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, VLO is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. VLO is currently trading at 0.31 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 31 cents for each dollar of sales.So, VLO appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to VLO, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick.

HUM reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.62, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11% and our estimate of $1.42. The bottom line climbed 30.6% year over year.The quarterly results benefited on the back of growing premiums coupled with solid segmental performances. However, the upside was partly hurt by an elevated operating expense level.Revenues of Humana amounted to $22,439 million, which rose 6.6% year over year in the quarter under review and our estimate of $21,977.4 million. The improvement came on the back of membership growth stemming from its individual Medicare Advantage business and state-based contract wins. Improved per-member individual Medicare Advantage premiums also contributed to the quarterly results. Yet, the top line fell short of the consensus mark by a whisker.Humana Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseHumana Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseHumana Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Humana Inc. QuoteOperational UpdateTotal premiums of Humana grew 7.3% year over year to $21,275 million. The figure outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21,181 million and our estimate of $20,680.9 million.Revenues from services came in at $1,004 million, which dropped 19.9% year over year in the fourth quarter. Investment income of $160 million compared favorably against the prior-year quarter’s investment loss of $34 million.The benefits expense ratio improved 60 basis points (bps) year over year to 87.3% on account of a decline in patient utilization within HUM’s individual Medicare Advantage business. The operating cost ratio of 15.9% improved 20 bps year over year, thanks to the divestiture of Humana’s 60% ownership stake in Kindred at Home (KAH) Hospice operations in August 2022.    Total operating expenses escalated 6.3% year over year to $22,315 million, higher than our estimate of $21,685.1 million. This was due to an increase in benefits, operating costs, and depreciation and amortization.Story continuesHumana reported a net loss of $18 million, wider than the prior-year quarter’s loss of $13 million.Realignment of SegmentsEarlier, HUM had three reportable segments - Retail, Group and Specialty, and Healthcare Services. In December 2022, it redistributed some of its businesses within its earlier segments. The realignment gave rise to two distinct segments: Insurance and CenterWell. The Insurance unit encompasses those businesses that were part of the Retail  as well as Group and Specialty segments. Earlier contained within the Healthcare Services unit, the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) business also forms a part of the newly formed Insurance segment. The second unit named CenterWell comprisees the payor-agnostic healthcare services offerings of Humana that includes pharmacy dispensing services, provider services and home services.InsuranceThe segment recorded revenues of $21,599 million, which advanced 7.3% year over year in the fourth quarter on the back of a growing customer base across its individual Medicare Advantage business and state-based contracts.Adjusted earnings came in at $53 million in the quarter under review, while a loss of $100 million was reported in the prior-year quarter. The benefits expense ratio improved 100 bps year over year to 87.5%. The operating cost ratio of 12.8% deteriorated 10 bps year over year due to elevated marketing expenses that Humana had incurred in 2022 to provide an impetus to its individual Medicare Advantage growth.   Total medical membership of the segment came in at 17.1 million as of Dec 31, 2022, which inched up 0.1% year over year.CenterWellThe segment’s revenues of $4,141 million increased 1.4% year over year in the fourth quarter, attributable to higher membership within HUM’s individual Medicare Advantage business, improved pharmacy revenues coupled with growing revenues from its provider business.Operating income of $263 million tumbled 12% year over year. The segment’s adjusted EBITDA slid 3.6% year over year to $325 million in the quarter under review.The operating cost ratio of 92.6% deteriorated 90 bps year over year.Financial Update (as of Dec 31, 2022)Humana exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $5,061 million, which soared 49.1% from the figure in 2021 end. Total assets of $43,055 million decreased 2.9% from the 2021-end level.HUM’s long-term debt totaled $9,034 million, down 14.3% from the figure as of Dec 31, 2021.

It had a leftover share repurchase capacity of $1 billion as of Jan 31, 2023. HUM also paid out dividends of $101 million to its shareholders during the quarter under review.2023 OutlookThis year, HUM anticipates revenues within $102.7-$104.7 billion, the mid-point of which indicates an improvement of 11.6% from the 2022 figure of $92.9 billion.Adjusted EPS is estimated to be a minimum of $28.00, which suggests minimum growth of 10.9% from the 2022 figure of $25.24.Revenues from the Insurance segment are projected within $99.5-$101 billion, the mid-point of which indicates a 12.9% rise from the 2022 figure of $88.8 billion. The CenterWell segment’s revenues are forecasted between $18 billion and $18.5 billion, the mid-point of which suggests 5.5% growth from the 2022 figure of $17.3 billion.Management anticipates individual Medicare Advantage membership to witness a minimum membership growth of 625,000 in 2023, up from the earlier projection of an increase in the range of 325,000-400,000.Group Medicare Advantage membership is likely to decrease by around 60,000, while the same from the Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plan is estimated to decline by around 800,000 members.The benefit ratio of the Insurance unit is estimated at 86.3-87.3% in 2023.

471,6a549cda-d908-36d0-8611-4cfdd33d6e9a,REG,2023-02-02,Regency Centers Corporation's (NASDAQ:REG) Stock Has Seen Strong Momentum: Does That Call For Deeper Study Of Its Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regency-centers-corporations-nasdaq-reg-134641919.html,1675259201,STORY,['REG'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Regency Centers' (NASDAQ:REG) stock increased significantly by 11% over the past three months. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on Regency Centers'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Regency Centers How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Regency Centers is:7.4% = US$461m ÷ US$6.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.07 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Regency Centers' Earnings Growth And 7.4% ROEWhen you first look at it, Regency Centers' ROE doesn't look that attractive. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 6.8%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. Having said that, Regency Centers has shown a modest net income growth of 15% over the past five years. Given the slightly low ROE, it is likely that there could be some other aspects that are driving this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesWe then compared Regency Centers' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 12% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is REG worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether REG is currently mispriced by the market.Is Regency Centers Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Regency Centers seems to be paying out most of its income as dividends judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 59%, meaning the company retains only 41% of its income. However, this is typical for REITs as they are often required by law to distribute most of their earnings. Despite this, the company's earnings grew moderately as we saw above.Besides, Regency Centers has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 117% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the higher expected payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Regency Centers certainly does have some positive factors to consider. That is, quite an impressive growth in earnings. However, the low profit retention means that the company's earnings growth could have been higher, had it been reinvesting a higher portion of its profits. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

(NYSE: EL) today reported net sales of $4.62 billion for its second quarter ended December 31, 2022, a decline of 17% from $5.54 billion in the prior-year period, including negative impacts from foreign currency. Organic net sales fell 11%. In the fiscal 2023 second quarter, the evolution of the COVID-19 environment, including restrictions in mainland China and the rising number of COVID cases (collectively ""COVID-related impacts""), led to stronger headwinds as the quarter progressed. As a result, tourism and product shipments to Hainan remained largely curtailed and traffic in brick-and-mortar in the rest of China was limited. These challenges were partially offset by broad-based strong organic net sales growth across developed and emerging markets globally. Organic net sales benefited from continued double-digit growth in Fragrance as well as strong holiday offerings and performance during the 11.11 Global Shopping Festival.The Company reported net earnings of $0.39 billion, compared with net earnings of $1.09 billion in the prior-year period2. Diluted net earnings per common share was $1.09, compared with $2.97 reported in the prior-year period, including the impacts of other intangible asset impairments. Excluding restructuring and other charges and adjustments as detailed on page 3, adjusted diluted net earnings per common share declined 49% to $1.54, decreasing 44% in constant currency, better than the Company’s expectations. These declines include a negative impact of 4% from certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations.Story continuesFabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer said, ""We delivered on our expectations for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, despite the incremental pressure of COVID-19 in China in December. Many developed and emerging markets around the world outperformed to realize our organic sales growth outlook and, given disciplined expense management and moderation of the stronger U.S. dollar, we exceeded our adjusted diluted EPS outlook. Fragrance excelled globally, while Makeup prospered in a great number of markets, as our brands are realizing the promise of the category’s renaissance as usage occasions resume.__________________________________1 Organic net sales represents net sales excluding returns associated with restructuring and other activities; non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures; as well as the impact from foreign currency translation. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP measure of organic net sales growth provides year-over-year sales comparisons on a consistent basis. See page 2 for reconciliations to GAAP.2 Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. which excludes net loss (earnings) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests for the second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 and noncontrolling interests for the second quarter of fiscal 2022.For fiscal 2023, we are lowering our outlook given the November and December disruption to travel and staffing levels in Hainan that slowed the expected normalization of inventory and the recently-announced potential roll-back of COVID-related supportive measures in Korea duty free. Together, these are creating a near-term, transitory pressure to our travel retail business. In the third quarter, this is more than offsetting the initial positive impact from the resumption of international travel by Chinese consumers, as well as favorable trends from our second quarter results, including outstanding performance across many developed markets in Western Europe and Asia/Pacific, as well as many emerging markets globally, and a less onerous currency environment. All told, our return to growth has shifted to the fourth quarter. We remain focused on investing in our brands, including for innovation, advertising, and entry into new countries, among others, to fuel our multiple engines of growth strategy.""Freda concluded, ""We are encouraged by both our strong momentum in numerous markets globally and improving macro trends. Moreover, so far this fiscal year, we have made exciting progress on several strategic initiatives to drive growth and resiliency in our business, with the opening of our China Innovation Labs as well as our first-ever manufacturing facility in Asia/Pacific, and with our deal to acquire Tom Ford, to name just a few. We have great confidence that we will emerge from this year even better positioned to realize the long-term growth opportunities of global prestige beauty.""Business UpdateThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to disrupt the Company’s operating environment through the first half of fiscal 2023, including the COVID-related impacts, affecting Asia travel retail, particularly Hainan, and retail traffic in mainland China. In Asia travel retail, these challenges led to prolonged store closures as well as the curtailment of travel and caused the tightening of inventory by certain retailers who had previously placed orders in anticipation of the return of travel that was since delayed.During the first half of fiscal 2023, the Company’s business was also negatively impacted by the strong U.S. dollar, along with inflationary pressures and recession concerns, which caused certain retailers in the United States to tighten inventory. While the Company’s monthly retail trends improved sequentially during the fiscal 2023 second quarter in the United States, the pace was slower than anticipated resulting in lower replenishment orders compared to the prior-year period.Fiscal 2023 Second Quarter ResultsProduct category and geographic region net sales commentary reflect organic performance.Reconciliation between GAAP and Non-GAAP Net Sales Growth(Unaudited)Three Months EndedDecember 31, 2022(3)As Reported - GAAP(1)(17)%Organic, Non-GAAP(2)(11)%Impact of the license terminations related to certain of the Company’s designer fragrances(1)Impact of foreign currency translation(5)Returns associated with restructuring and other activities—As Reported - GAAP(1)(17)%(1)Includes returns associated with restructuring and other activities(2)Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth excluding returns associated with restructuring and other activities; non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures (the license terminations related to certain of the Company’s designer fragrances); as well as the impact of foreign currency translation.(3)Percentages are calculated on an individual basisAdjusted diluted net earnings per common share excludes restructuring and other charges and adjustments as detailed in the following table.Reconciliation between GAAP and Non-GAAP - Diluted Net Earnings Per Share (""EPS"")(Unaudited)Three Months EndedDecember 3120222021GrowthAs Reported EPS - GAAP(1)$1.09$2.97 (63)%Non-GAAPRestructuring and other charges.02.03Change in fair value of acquisition-related stock options (less the portion attributable toredeemable noncontrolling interest)(.01).01Other intangible asset impairments.44—Adjusted EPS - Non-GAAP$1.54$3.01 (49)%Impact of foreign currency translation on earnings per share.15Adjusted Constant Currency EPS - Non-GAAP$1.69$3.01 (44)%(1)Includes restructuring and other charges and adjustmentsNet sales and operating income in the Company’s product categories and regions were unfavorably impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar in relation to most currencies.

Organic net sales decreased 8%.Net earnings3 were $0.88 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $2.45. In the prior year six months, the Company reported net earnings of $1.78 billion and diluted earnings per share of $4.85.__________________________________3 Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. which excludes net (earnings) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and noncontrolling interests for the six months ended December 31, 2021.During the six-months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded restructuring and other charges, other intangible asset impairments, and change in fair value of acquisition-related stock options, that, combined, resulted in an unfavorable impact of $219 million ($167 million less the portion attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest and net of tax), equal to $.46 per diluted share, as detailed on page 16. The prior-year period results include restructuring and other charges, change in fair value of acquisition-related stock options, and other income related to a gain on previously held equity investment in Deciem Beauty Group Inc. that, combined, resulted in a favorable impact of $22 million ($18 million after tax), equal to $.05 per diluted share.Excluding restructuring and other charges and adjustments referred to in the previous bullet, adjusted diluted net earnings per common share for the six months ended December 31, 2022 was $2.91, and declined 36% in constant currency. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on diluted net earnings per common share was $.22.Cash FlowsFor the six months ended December 31, 2022, net cash flows provided by operating activities were $0.75 billion, compared with $1.85 billion in the prior-year period. This reflects lower earnings before taxes, excluding non-cash items, and the negative impact from changes in working capital, primarily accounts payable, due to the timing of payments.Capital Expenditures decreased to $419 million compared to $459 million last year, primarily reflecting timing of investments.The Company ended the quarter with $3.73 billion in cash and cash equivalents after returning $0.71 billion cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.In November 2022, the Company announced it signed an agreement to acquire the TOM FORD brand. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter and to be funded through a combination of cash, debt and deferred payments to the sellers.Outlook for Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter and Full YearThe Company expects the remainder of the fiscal year to be volatile, including risks associated with the uncertain pace of recovery of consumers in travel retail, and pressured by the ongoing disruptions due to the evolving COVID-19 environment, inflation, supply chain disruptions, and the risk of a slowdown in certain markets globally.The Company remains optimistic about the prospects and future growth in global prestige beauty and plans to invest in its business during this difficult environment to support share gains and long-term growth, including investments in advertising, innovation, its innovation center in Shanghai and its manufacturing facility in Japan. In the near-term, these investments will have a greater impact to diluted net earnings per common share due to the expected decline in net sales. With multiple engines of growth across regions, brands, product categories and channels, the Company is well-positioned to drive diversified long-term growth across its portfolio.The second half outlook reflects the following assumptions and expectations:A shift in the return to growth in Asia Travel Retail and mainland China from the fiscal 2023 third quarter to the fourth quarter, reflecting:The normalization of inventory levels in Hainan, given the disruptions from the COVID-related impacts in November and December.The transitory pressure to the Company’s travel retail business with its Korean duty free retailers due to the potential roll-back of temporary COVID-related government supportive measures in Korea duty free.An acceleration of retail sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 in travel retail, primarily due to the resumption of outbound Chinese traveling consumers.A moderate return to net sales growth in mainland China, given the disruption from the COVID-related impacts in November and December that slowed expected brick-and-mortar retail traffic in the second quarter and is continuing to dampen traffic in the third quarter.Increased productive distribution throughout the year to retailers that provide new consumer reach and continued strategic entry into new countries for some of the Company’s brands.The mitigation of most inflationary pressures through strategic price increases, mix optimization and cost savings in other areas.Incremental savings from the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program and reinvestment in advertising and capabilities.Full-year effective tax rate of approximately 25.5%.The full year outlook does not reflect the net sales and the slight dilution to earnings per share from the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand that is expected to be completed in the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter.The Company is mindful of ongoing risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as risks related to the effects of the global macro environment, including the risk of recession; foreign currency volatility; increasing inflationary pressures; supply chain disruptions; social and political issues; regulatory matters, including the imposition of tariffs and sanctions; geopolitical tensions; and global security issues. The Company is also mindful of inflationary pressures on its cost base and consumer behaviors.Third Quarter Fiscal 2023Sales OutlookReported net sales are forecasted to decrease between 14% and 12% versus the prior-year period. This range includes:A shift in the return to growth in Asia Travel Retail and mainland China, as detailed above.A negative 3% due to foreign currency translation.The negative impact of 1% from the termination of the Company’s license agreements for the Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, Tommy Hilfiger and Ermenegildo Zegna product lines effective June 30, 2022.Organic net sales, which excludes returns associated with restructuring and other activities; non-comparable impacts from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures; as well as the impact of foreign currency translation, are forecasted to decrease between 10% and 8%.Earnings per Share OutlookReported diluted net earnings per common share are projected to be between $.32 and $.43.

If you want to see more top performing consumer staples stocks in January, go directly to 5 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January.Demand for many consumer staples does not change that much in the near term.While economic conditions might deteriorate, the overall demand for food will remain largely the same or increase as the population increases.Similarly, the overall demand for essential consumer products like toothpaste or detergent will not change very much despite changes in economic condition. Because toothpaste or detergent are considered essential and don't cost very much, many consumers keep buying the products and cut spending on more expensive and not as needed products in more difficult economic times.Individual Company Demand Can Change More Than the Overall Sector DemandWhile the overall demand for many consumer goods might not change as much, the individual demand for consumer good companies does change more frequently and sometimes quite substantially.If a competitor does a good job in terms of marketing, a leading consumer staple might lose market share and it might not make as much profit as the market expects.If the leading consumer staple does a good job in terms of launching new products or growing in new emerging markets, it could potentially make more profit than what the market expects even though the overall demand for a consumer staple remains largely the same.If there is a lot of inflation like what has occurred in 2022, some of the more premium consumer staples brands might not sell as much as consumers downgrade to cheaper alternatives to save money.Consumer Staples ETFIn terms of the consumer staples ETFs, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) ""seeks to provide an effective representation of the consumer staples sector of the S&amp;P 500 Index."" Specifically the ETF, ""seeks to provide precise exposure to companies from the food and staples retailing, beverage, food product, tobacco, household product and personal product industries in the U.S.""Story continuesIn terms of the ETF's characteristics as of January 30, 2023, The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) has a weighted price to earnings ratio of 20.97, a weighted price to book ratio of 5.44 and an est. 3-5 year EPS growth rate of 6.74%.The ETF has an inception date of December 16, 1998 and a gross expense ratio of 0.10%.Because many leading consumer staple stocks are dividend stocks given their relatively stable businesses, The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) has a 30 Day SEC yield of 2.55%.S&amp;P 500 Performance in JanuaryIn terms of January, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied 6.6% in the month as fourth quarter U.S. GDP growth has been stronger than expected and as inflation has shown signs of having potentially peaked last year.Given the Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates further this year, however, stocks could decline if economic data doesn't meet estimates. As a result it could be a good idea to have a well diversified portfolio of blue chip stocks across many different sectors.Niloo / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January, we took the 33 holdings of The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR® Fund (XLP) as of January 30.Of the stocks, we took the top 12 performing in terms of year to date performance as of January 31 according to Finviz.com.Given the leading consumer staple stocks aren't usually very volatile, many of the top 12 performing stocks have not exceeded the S&amp;P 500's 6.6% rally in January. In fact the 12 listed are the only 12 that are positive year to date as of 1/31 among the 33 holdings.12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January12. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 0.11%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is a leading grocery chain whose stock has increased by around 0.11% this year as of January 31. Although 0.11% isn't very good, the performance nevertheless ranks the stock #12 on our list of 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January given many other stocks in the sector are lower year to date.The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is currently trying to get regulatory approval to complete its purchase of Albertsons which would give the company more scale and bargaining power if the deal successfully closes. Currently, the companies hope the merger will successfully complete in 2024.Alongside The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is a top performing consumer staple in January.11. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 0.31%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) is a leading consumer staple with a portfolio of well known brands such as Arm &amp; Hammer and OxiClean. While Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) shares have increased 0.31% in January, they are still down 21.5% in the last year as inflation has been challenging for demand. In Q3, the company's organic sales declined 0.7% year over year due to a volume decline of 8.5%, partially offset by positive pricing of 7.8%. If inflation normalizes in the long term, however, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) could have more growth potential.10. SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 1.32%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY) has rallied 1.32% year to date as of the end of January as the leading food distribution company's valuation has improved slightly given the higher S&amp;P 500. Considering many investors own the stock for its dividend yield of 2.53%, the stock's valuation has decreased as interest rates have increased substantially in 2022.If interest rates normalize in the long term, there's potential for SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY) to potentially gain a higher valuation if it maintains its earnings growth. When interest rates normalize is up for debate, however, as many think it could be at least several years. SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY) ranks #10 on our list of 12 Top Performing Consumer Staples Stocks in January.9. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Year to Date Performance as of January 31: 1.47%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Leading discount retailer Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stock has approximately doubled since the beginning of 2013 given the company's organic growth and shares have rallied 1.47% in the month of January as company has benefited from the rise in inflation in 2022 with more customers shopping at its stores.

UDR is slated to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results on Feb 6 after market close. Results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share from the respective year-ago reported figures.In the last reported quarter, this Denver, CO-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 1.69% in terms of FFO as adjusted per share. The quarterly results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues, driven by robust operating trends and past accretive external growth investments.In the last four quarters, UDR’s FFO as adjusted per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on one occasion and met the same on the other three, the average surprise being 0.42%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. price-eps-surprise | United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Factors to ConsiderUDR has a geographically diverse portfolio and a superior product mix of A/B quality properties in the urban and suburban markets. Moreover, UDR’s portfolio comprises properties throughout the United States, including the coastal and Sunbelt locations. This strategy of maintaining a diversified portfolio across various geographies and price points limits volatility and concentration risks and helps UDR generate steady operating cash flows.However, for the U.S. apartment market, low consumer confidence and high inflation have taken a toll, with net demand for apartments ending in negative territory for calendar 2022, per a report from the real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage. Despite solid job growth and wage gains, there was weak demand for all types of housing.Amid this soft demand, new-lease apartment rents fell in December for the fourth consecutive month, declining another 0.4%. The cumulative rent drop was around 1.6% since September. Also, the national apartment vacancy surged from a record seasonal low of 2.5% one year ago to 5.0% in December 2022.This demand softness is likely to have impacted UDR as well. In its November 2022 Investor Presentation, for the fourth quarter, management expected 6-7% year-over-year effective blended lease rate growth.Also, management projected 96.7-96.9% of weighted average occupancy, with the same for October being 96.8%. Consequently, management projected 11.25-12.25% year-over-year straight-line same-store revenue growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is currently pegged at $399.8 million. This indicates a 15.2% year-over-year rise.UDR enjoys a decent balance sheet position and banks on technological moves and process enhancements to fuel growth. This residential REIT focuses on enhancing cost control through its Next Generation Operating Platform.Such efforts to find efficiencies throughout its operating platform are likely to have boosted workforce productivity and residents’ experiences in the fourth quarter. The adoption of technology is also anticipated to have bolstered UDR’s margin during the period under review.In its third-quarter earnings release, UDR projected its fourth-quarter 2022 FFO as adjusted per share in the range of 60-62 cents.Before the fourth-quarter earnings release, the company’s activities were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO as adjusted per share has remained unchanged at 61 cents in the past month. This suggests year-over-year growth of 12.96%.For 2022, UDR projected FFO as adjusted per share in the range of $2.32-$2.34. This projection is based on the company’s expectation of 10.75-11.25% year-over-year growth in same-store cash revenues and 13.25-14% growth in same-store NOI.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO as adjusted per share is pegged at $2.33. The figure indicates a 15.9% increase year over year on 17.9% year-over-year growth in revenues to $1.52 billion.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for UDR this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.UDR currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -1.82%.

The stocks were left for dead last year as mortgage rates jumped over 7%. Sales of existing, and new homes, plunged virtually overnight.Wall Street thought the homebuilders were doomed with higher mortgage rates. Many people believed that this could be a replay of 2008 with inventory soaring, foreclosures and short sales, and prices plunging. The last place you would want to be in 2008 2.0 is in the homebuilder stocks.Has Housing Already Bottomed? But rates have come down off 2022 highs and the 30-year fixed is around 6%. According to some of the national, publicly-traded, homebuilders demand has picked up again. Is it a boom time again? No. But orders aren’t as bad as last year.Even more importantly, homebuilder margins are remaining elevated as lumber prices have fallen and other material costs have come down even though the builders are giving out more incentives, cutting prices and doing mortgage rate buydowns.The “Hope” TradeThe homebuilder stocks have rallied over the last 3 months on the “hope” trade for the spring season but they remain cheap on a P/E basis.Should investors be diving back into the homebuilder stocks?3 Cheap Homebuilder Stocks1. PulteGroup, Inc. PHMPulteGroup is one of the largest homebuilders in the United States. When it reports earnings, Wall Street listens.PulteGroup recently reported Q4 2022 but it did not give guidance for the full year of 2023. It only gave margin guidance for Q1. PulteGroup saw demand rise very month in Q4, as well as the first full month of Q1, which was Jan 2023.Story continuesShares of PulteGroup surged 41% in the last 3 months but are still cheap, with a forward P/E of just 7.4. But earnings are expected to fall 30% in 2023 as sales remain depressed.Was 2022 peak earnings for PulteGroup2. D.R. Horton, Inc. DHID.R.

(NYSE:DHI)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-d-161836173.html,1675268316,STORY,['DHI'],"[D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at D.R. Horton’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for D.R. Horton Is D.R. Horton Still Cheap?Good news, investors! D.R. Horton is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $158.59, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, D.R. Horton’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from D.R. Horton?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of D.R. Horton, it is expected to deliver a highly negative earnings growth in the next few years, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although DHI is currently undervalued, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. I recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to DHI, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on DHI for some time, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. For example - D.R.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest airline have returned +26.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, which American Airlines falls in, has gained 16.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.American Airlines is expected to post a loss of $0.01 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +99.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +96.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +300%. This estimate has changed +41.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.71 indicates a change of +35.5% from what American Airlines is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +8.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for American Airlines.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for AAL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of American Airlines, the consensus sales estimate of $12.09 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +35.9%. The $52.4 billion and $54.21 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +7% and +3.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmerican Airlines reported revenues of $13.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +39.9%. EPS of $1.17 for the same period compares with -$1.42 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.22 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.22%. The EPS surprise was +2.63%.Over the last four quarters, American Airlines surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.American Airlines is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about American Airlines. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more companies in this selection, check out 5 Most Valuable Retail Companies In The World. Retailers are facing challenges due to the rapid changes happening in the industry. Only a small portion of executives are confident about increasing profits in the upcoming year. Most expect inflation to affect their margins and anticipate a decrease in consumer spending due to financial worries. Despite the challenges, retailers have developed resilience in recent years. The pandemic caused significant changes in consumer demand, which led retailers to modernize their systems to better adapt to these changes. This includes improved analytics and strategies to maintain customer loyalty in response to changing consumer preferences.The Retail Industry: An AnalysisAccording to Deloitte, retail sales growth is expected to be limited by a slowing economy. In a baseline scenario with a 55% chance of happening, GDP growth is predicted to decrease from 2% in 2022 to 0.9% in 2023. Although a strong labor market will continue to drive sales, there is a risk of a recession which could lead to economic contraction and higher unemployment.Physical retail stores and online platforms are becoming important sources of advertising for vendors. Retailers are earning more revenue by selling marketing space to vendors, which strengthens their partnerships. The sale of advertising space on websites, in-store displays, mobile apps, and streaming services is expected to increase among retailers, with the greatest growth coming from streaming TV.The top retailers in the US are at the forefront of maximizing retail media networks. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was quick to use its acquisition of Thursday Night Football streaming to sell advertising space to vendors and enhance its marketing. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)’s partnership with Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU) to sell commercials on the ad-supported CTV will become even stronger if its potential merger with Albertsons goes ahead. Similarly, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has a long history of working with vendors on retail media networks and has created its own network called Walmart Connect, which generated over $2 billion in revenue in 2021. The growth of advertising revenue, excluding website placements, is expected to increase 38% in 2023, reaching $6.5 billion. The growth of social commerce offers a new opportunity for retailers and brands. Story continuesIn addition to exploring the most valuable retail companies in the world, investors can also check out 15 Internet Retail Stocks To Buy, 10 Best Retail Stocks To Buy Now, and Largest Retailers in the US. Our Methodology We used stock screeners to identify the most valuable retail companies in the world based on market capitalization as of January 31, 2023.

The company’s second quarter earnings were slightly below consensus estimates; however, the outlook for the rest of the year showed steady growth despite difficult comparisons with the second half of 2021. O’Reilly Automotive continues to grow its store base and has recently announced an expansion into Mexico.

Strength in the second quarter was driven by better-than-expected sales of consumable items. Guidance for the remainder of the year was increased. In addition to solid earnings, forecasts for the increasing expectations of a recession drove positive sentiment towards consumer discretionary companies with more predictable revenue like dollar stores.”12. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Market Capitalization as of January 31: $78.566 BillionTarget Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is a general merchandise retailer in the United States, offering food assortments, grocery, apparel, accessories, home decor products, electronics, toys, seasonal offerings, beauty products, and household essentials.

Although sales were slightly better than expected, Target saw a slowdown in discretionary sales. Gross margins were below expectations with higher markdowns, increased shrink, and incremental costs. Long-term, we expect Target to be able to return to operating margins in the 6% to 8% range as inventories return to normal levels as well as seeing a normalization in supply chain costs.”11. The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX)Market Capitalization as of January 31: $94.479 BillionThe TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) was incorporated in 1962 and is headquartered in Framingham, Massachusetts.

(NYSE:TJX) in its fourth quarter 2022 investor letter:“In the fourth quarter, the Consumer Discretionary sector was the largest positive contributor to our relative performance, in part driven by contributions from The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX). TJX is a leading off-price apparel and home goods retailer. After a couple of years of bumpy performance due to closing stores during the height of the pandemic and absorbing rising supply chain costs, sales and margins have reverted towards more normal levels. We believe TJX’s consumer value proposition remains terrific and they will continue to gobble up market share from department stores over the long term.”10. JD.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:JD) is one of the most valuable retail companies worldwide. Here is what Argosy Investors has to say about JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We sold JD as a result of the furor over Chinese stocks during the quarter. We had been concerned about China’s lack of respect for investor rights for some time, and Beijing has become significantly more aggressive in asserting itself of late. In addition, the legal structure Chinese companies use to come public in the U.S., a Cayman Islands shell corporation leaves American investors with an unsure path to recovering value should these companies cease to trade on U.S. exchanges. Because of the uncertainty, we exited our position in JD completely. We still love JD’s long-term prospects, but we cannot estimate the legal/regulatory risk associated with these companies anymore. More broadly, we are freeing up cash for some other positions we already own which have declined in this market, and after additional review, remain attractive.”9. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Market Capitalization as of January 31: $115.255 BillionCVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) was founded in 1963 and is headquartered in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. It is a health services provider that operates through Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, and ​​Retail/LTC segments. The company's Retail/LTC segment sells prescription and over-the-counter drugs, consumer health and beauty products, and personal care products. The company was priorly known as CVS Caremark Corporation and changed its name to CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in September 2014. Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”8. Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)Market Capitalization as of January 31: $124.357 BillionLowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) and its subsidiaries function as home improvement retailers worldwide.

(NYSE:LOW) is one of the most valuable retail companies globally. Baron Funds made the following comment about Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is the second-largest home improvement center in the U.S. The company has several competitive advantages including scale, distribution efficiencies, interconnected retail through stores/internet, excellent management, and a strong balance sheet. The company is valued at only 14 times estimated earnings per share versus its long-term average P/E multiple of approximately 18 times estimated earnings per share.The shares of Lowe’s Companies, Inc. increased 7% in the most recent quarter following better-than-expected quarterly business results. Lowe’s is the second largest home improvement center in the U.S. The company has several competitive advantages including scale, distribution efficiencies, interconnected retail through stores/internet, excellent management, and a strong balance sheet. We believe the shares are attractively valued at only 14 times estimated earnings per share versus a long-term average P/E multiple of approximately 18 times estimated earnings per share.”7. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Market Capitalization as of January 31: $196.394 BillionNIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) designs, develops, and markets athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories worldwide.

(NYSE:NKE) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Adobe and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) were solid performers in the quarter as some of the doom and gloom narratives around these companies have waned as they both saw strong recent business results. Nike has been dealing with weak demand in China (mostly due to rolling COVID lockdowns) but also a bloated inventory position in North American apparel as well. Supply chain issues caused delays in last year’s inventory shipments. As those were overcome, newer orders came in earlier than expected causing the spike in inventory. On its most recent earnings call, it became clear to us that this inventory spike is a temporary supply issue and narrowly focused in apparel. Demand for Nike products is strong, especially for footwear where nearly every geography grew over 30% in constant currencies in the past quarter. The company expects the inventory issue to be largely behind it in the next two to three quarters and is already seeing inventory levels decline sequentially.”6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Market Capitalization as of January 31: $224.875 BillionCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates membership warehouses in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, France, Iceland, China, and Taiwan, offering branded and private-label merchandise products.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the leading retail companies worldwide.Madison Funds made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Valuable Retail Companies In The World.  Suggested articles:15 Biggest Neuroscience Companies in the World10 Recent Spinoff Companies Hedge Funds Are Buying15 Countries that Produce the Most Hydropower Disclosure: None. 15 Most Valuable Retail Companies In The World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Dan?Dan Houston: Thanks, Humphrey, and welcome to everyone on the call. This morning, I will discuss the milestones we achieved in 2022 as we executed on our strategy, along with key highlights from our fourth quarter and full year 2022. Deanna will follow with additional details on our fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results, our current financial and capital position, as well as an update on LDTI. In 2021, we outlined our strategic path forward, one balanced with a focus on a higher growth, more capital efficient portfolio and a commitment to return more capital to shareholders. This guided our successful execution in 2022 despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. We've made meaningful progress towards our goals and continue to invest in our long-term growth drivers of retirement, global asset management and benefits and protection.In January, we announced an agreement to reinsure our U.S. retail fixed annuity and universal life insurance with secondary guarantee blocks of business. The transaction closed in May and was a key milestone reinforcing our strategic focus on continuing to evolve into a higher growth, higher return, more capital efficient portfolio while improving our overall risk profile. We delivered on our strengthened capital deployment strategy and our commitment to rightsize, return the excess capital that we have built up during the pandemic with $2.3 billion returned to shareholders in 2022 through share repurchases and common stock dividends. We've continued to adapt to the volatile and uncertain macro environment and have taken appropriate actions to manage our expenses with pressured revenue while continuing to serve the needs of our customers, invest for growth and deliver strong total shareholder return.Starting on Slide 2, we reported $1.7 billion of full year 2022 non-GAAP operating earnings, or $6.66 per diluted share. Excluding significant variances, earnings per share increased 2% over 2021, a strong result given the pressured macroeconomic environment. As shown on Slide 3, we reported $422 million of non-GAAP operating earnings or $1.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. We ended 2022 with $635 billion of total company managed AUM. Unfavorable equity and fixed income markets pressured AUM throughout 2022 and $23 billion was transferred out in the second quarter as part of the reinsurance transaction. Turning to investment performance on Slide 5, our long-term performance remained strong, particularly in our specialty fixed income strategies.The volatile markets impacted our short-term investment performance throughout 2022 as our investment style, which is focused on high-quality growth stocks was out of favor for much of the year. During a volatile and pressured year for asset managers, we generated a positive $3.9 billion of full year total company net cash flow. This was $1 billion higher than our 2021 net cash flow and included $4.4 billion of positive PGI managed net cash flow. This was a very strong result during a period of outflows across the industry. The positive net cash flow in 2022 was driven by strong institutional flows across equities, real estate and specialty fixed income highlighting the value of our diversified distribution through our institutional, retail and retirement channels.Fourth quarter total company net cash flow was negative $3 billion. Net cash flow is typically negative in the fourth quarter for both PGI and RIS-Fee. Similar to other asset managers, we experienced retail platform outflows during the quarter as customers moved cash to the sidelines. While market volatility can impact the timing of when new mandates fund, we are seeing positive momentum with our institutional clients. Early in 2023, we have meaningful commitments for several of our fixed income and special equity strategies, which are expected to fund in the first quarter. The committed pipeline for our real estate products is healthy, which will likely start funding in the second half of the year. Turning to our growth drivers and some additional highlights for the year.In Retirement, we continue to solidify our position as a top retirement provider as we completed the integration of the IRT business in early 2022. The acquisition provides us with new capabilities, additional revenue-generating opportunities and expanded distribution relationships. RIS-Fee contract lapses contributed to negative account value net cash flow in the quarter. The fourth quarter is typically the highest quarter for lapses as plans often change providers at the end of the year. Roughly one-third of the lapsed account value was related to a single, low-fee large case with no principal managed assets. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we anticipate positive net cash flow in light of our sales pipeline. The underlying fundamentals of the Retirement business were strong throughout 2022.Compared to full year 2021, total recurring deposits increased a very strong 26% with a 14% increase on our legacy block. This was driven by employment growth and wage inflation, as well as increases in participant deferrals, company matches and higher incentive compensation. We also saw great opportunities in the future with the passage of SECURE 2.0, a bill for which we advocated. This legislation expands the U.S. retirement market overall, creating greater access to retirement savings plans for businesses and improving long-term savings in financial security for Americans. While it will take time and won't have an immediate impact, we expect that the bill will drive increases in new plant formations employer matches as well as employee participation in deferrals, all of which will help support better retirement readiness and long-term growth in our business.We're uniquely positioned to benefit from SECURE 2.0, thanks to its focus on small and midsized businesses and its support for more cost-effective start-up plans. We're already leaders in this market and applaud the additional options for workers to save more for retirement. Outside the U.S., we continue to focus on markets with compelling growth opportunities where we can leverage our local and global asset management capabilities and lean into established local partners. During the fourth quarter, we extended and strengthened our asset management partnership with CIMB in Southeast Asia. And at the end of the year, we closed our transaction with China Construction Bank Pension Management Company, acquiring a minority ownership stake in the pension company.This is expected to be immediately accretive and grow over time. Both opportunities expand our existing partnerships of more than 17 years with these market-leading wealth management, mutual fund and pension distributors. In Global Asset Management, we continue to unify our investment footprint across more than 80 markets we serve, demonstrated by the launch of Principal Asset Management in October and increasing integration with Principal International. We continue to expand our specialty offering in 2022. As an example, our direct lending team doubled its committed capital and increased their foothold in the middle market throughout the year. Principal Asset Management has once again been named the Best Place to Work in Money Management by pensions and investments.Office, Work, ColleaguesPhoto by Damir Kopezhanov on UnsplashThis is the 11th consecutive year we have earned this recognition, and it's a testament to the work of our employees to create a positive culture and deliver results for our customers. In Benefits and Protection, our focus on the small to medium-sized business delivered strong results in 2022. The businesses we serve prioritize providing benefits to attract and retain employees throughout the year. Record sales, strong retention and employment growth is evident in Specialty Benefits results. We deepened our relationships with existing customers, attracted new customers and expanded our market share. In Specialty Benefits, premium and fees increased a robust 11% year-over-year, exceeding the top end of our guidance range, with over half of the growth coming from net new business.Full year sales increased 19% compared to 2021 with continued strong momentum early in 2023. Our focus on business owner and our diversified set of solutions continues to drive results in Individual Life insurance. Full year business market sales hit record levels up 73% year-over-year. This growth included record non-qualified COLI sales. Approximately 50% of these sales were with our retirement plan customers, highlighting the value of our integrated business model. We're delivering on our go forward strategy, transforming our portfolio businesses, resulting in a higher multiple and increased shareholder value. We have de-risked our portfolio, reduced our balance sheet risk and our less capital intensive. We have sharpened our focus on higher growth markets, investing in our business and leveraging our competitive advantages all while returning more capital to shareholders.While 2023 presents its own challenges, we have a good line of sight and confidence in achieving our long-term financial targets. Deanna?Deanna Strable: Thanks, Dan. Good morning to everyone on the call. This morning I'll share the key contributors to our financial performance for the quarter and full year, our current financial and capital position, as well as an update on LDTI. Full year reported net income attributable to principal was $4.8 billion, excluding income from exited businesses net income was $1.5 billion for the full year with manageable credit losses of $48 million. Fourth quarter non-GAAP net income, excluding exited businesses was $504 million with $12 million of credit losses. As a reminder, the income from exited business is non-economic and is driven by the change in the fair value of the funds withheld embedded derivative. Importantly, it doesn't impact our capital or free cash flow and can be extremely volatile quarter-to-quarter.We also had positive credit drift during the year further demonstrating the quality of our balance sheet. We reported full year non-GAAP operating earnings of $1.7 billion or $6.66 per diluted share including $422 million or $1.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. Excluding significant variances full year non-GAAP operating earnings was $1.7 billion or $6.77 per diluted share, this included $420 million in the fourth quarter or $1.69 per diluted share. Compared to full year 2021, we increased earnings per share 2% as the benefit from share repurchases and strong customer growth was partially offset by macroeconomic pressures on earnings. As detailed on Slide 15, we had several significant variances that virtually offset and had a slight net positive impact on non-GAAP operating earnings during the fourth quarter.On a pre-tax basis, benefits from lower DAC amortization higher than expected Latin American Encaje performance and favorable Brazilian inflation more than offset lower than expected variable investment income. These had a net positive impact to reported non-GAAP operating earnings of approximately $5 million pre-tax, $2 million after tax, and $0.01 per diluted share. While variable investment income was positive for the quarter, we experienced lower than expected alternative investment returns, prepayment fees and real estate sales. Macroeconomic volatility continued in the fourth quarter and pressured earnings in our fee-based businesses. The S&amp;P 500 daily average decreased 3% from the third quarter of 2022, 16% from the fourth quarter of 2021 and 4% on a full year basis.Relative to our 2022 outlook, the full year 2022 S&amp;P 500 daily average was 17% lower than we expected heading into the year and fixed income returns were approximately 18% lower. This unfavorable market performance negatively impacted AUM, account values, fee revenue margins and earnings in RIS-Fee and PGI throughout the year. Headwinds from foreign exchange rates pressured reported pre-tax operating earnings by a negative $5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and a negative $21 million for the full year. It was immaterial compared to the third quarter of 2022. Throughout 2022, we took actions across the enterprise to manage expenses as fee revenue was pressured as we have during previous periods of unfavorable macroeconomics. Our efforts have paid off, on a full year basis, compensation and other expenses excluding significant variances were 3% lower than 2021 and fourth quarter expenses were 8% lower than the fourth quarter of 2021, despite approximately $15 million of elevated severance and restructuring expenses across the fee-based businesses in the quarter.Some expenses naturally adjusted throughout the year like incentive compensation and other variable cost, and we took actions to reduce other expenses while continuing to balance investments for growth. As a result, we didn't see the typical 7% to 10% increase in compensation and other expenses this fourth quarter relative to the average of the first three quarters. Turning to the business units, the following comments on fourth quarter and full year results exclude significant variances. RIS-Fee's margin improved in the fourth quarter, but end of the year below guidance as the benefit from IRT expense synergies was more than offset by unfavorable market performance, which pressured fees and net revenues throughout the year. Through the end of 2022, we've realized more than $80 million of run rate expense synergies and are well on track to realize the full $90 million in 2023.RIS-Spread net revenue growth and pre-tax margin exceeded our post-transaction guidance for the full year. Favorable investment income, a benefit from rising short-term interest rates and growth in the business helped offset the impacts of the reinsurance transaction. We completed $1.9 billion of pension risk transfer sales in 2022, including more than $750 million in the fourth quarter. The PRT pipeline remains very strong as we head into the first quarter. PGI's pre-tax margin was 39% for the full year and at the low end of our guidance range despite significant macro headwinds throughout the year. The overall management fee rate of approximately 29 basis points remain stable. And Principal International pre-tax operating earnings were pressured throughout 2022 as underlying growth in the business was masked by the regulatory fee reduction in Mexico and foreign exchange headwinds.On a constant currency basis, full year pre-tax operating earnings increased 5% over 2021 with strong growth in Brazil and Chile. In Specialty Benefits, pre-tax operating earnings and premium fees both increased the strong 11% over full year 2021. This was fueled by record sales as well as strong retention and employment growth while maintaining disciplined expense management and a stable loss ratio. Turning to capital and liquidity, despite the volatile environment, we remain in a strong financial position heading into 2023. We ended 2022 with $1.5 billion of excess and available capital. This is above our targeted levels as we felt it was prudent to be disciplined due to the uncertain and volatile macro environment. This included approximately $1 billion at the holding company, $200 million above our $800 million target, $425 million in our subsidiaries, and $80 million in excess of our targeted 400% risk-based capital ratio estimated to be 406% at the end of the year.Our leverage ratio is low at 22% and within our 20% to 25% targeted range. We have the financial flexibility, discipline, and experience necessary to manage through this time of macro volatility and uncertainty. As shown on Slide 4, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders in 2022, including nearly $1.7 billion of share repurchases and more than $640 million of common stock dividends. We also deployed $300 million to debt reduction and approximately $200 million towards M&amp;A bringing our full year capital deployments to $2.8 billion. In the fourth quarter, we returned more than $400 million to shareholders with $250 million of share repurchases and $156 million of common stock dividends. Last night, we announced a $0.64 common stock dividend payable in the first quarter in line with our targeted 40% dividend payout ratio.We remain focused on maintaining our capital and liquidity targets at both a life company and the holding company and will continue with a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment as we head into 2023. Our investment portfolio is high quality and a good fit for our liability profile. The commercial mortgage loan portfolio is very high quality with an average loan to value of 46% and an average debt service coverage ratio of 2.5 times. We have a diverse and manageable exposure to other alternatives and high risk sectors, and importantly, our liabilities are long-term and we have disciplined asset liability management. Additional details of our investment portfolio are available in the appendix of the slides. As a reminder, LDTI goes into effect in the first quarter.Importantly, this doesn't change our underlying economics, free cash flow generation or our capital position, but it will have an impact on our reported financial results. We plan to release a recast fourth quarter supplement on March 1, the night before our 2023 outlook call. The most notable impact to total company non-GAAP operating earnings is a change to the geography of some variable annuity fees, moving the hedging related fees below the line. This will reduce our operating earnings by approximately $60 million on an annual basis with no corresponding impact to net income, free cash flow generation or our capital position. In addition, there will be impacts to segment earnings that will largely offset at a consolidated level. More details will be shared during our upcoming outlook call.Moving to equity, the transition impact from the adoption of LDTI will decrease total stockholders' equity by approximately $5.3 billion as of January 1, 2021 with nearly all of the impact in AOCI. Sitting here today, we expect the impact of stockholders' equity from LDTI to be slightly positive as of the fourth quarter of 2022, as interest rates have risen significantly from where they were at the beginning of 2021. 2022 was a transformative year for Principal as we completed the reinsurance transactions mid-year, executed on our go-forward strategy and strengthened our capital management and deployment approach. We're focused on maximizing our growth drivers of retirement, global asset management and benefits and protection, which will drive long-term growth for the enterprise and long-term shareholder value.This concludes our prepared remarks.

Net earnings were $185 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared with $1.0 billion, or $1.57 per diluted share a year ago. The large decline in net earnings for the fourth quarter reflects significant foreign exchange-related net investment losses recognized in the current quarter as compared with significant net realized gains a year ago.Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2022 included net investment losses of $521 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, compared with net investment gains of $243 million, or $0.37 per diluted share a year ago. These net investment losses were driven by net losses on certain derivatives and foreign currency activities of $684 million, which was partially offset by $207 million of net gains from sales and redemptions, both of which were largely driven by changes in exchange rates. Net investment losses also included a $28 million loss from a decrease in the fair value of equity securities and a $16 million increase in the company's current expected credit losses (CECL) reserves and impairments.Adjusted earnings* in the fourth quarter were $806 million, compared with $850 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, reflecting a decrease of 5.2%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share* increased 0.8% to $1.29 in the quarter.

The decline in the portfolio is principally driven by the weaker yen and higher interest rates.Shareholders' equity was $22.4 billion, or $36.35 per share, at December 31, 2022, compared with $33.3 billion, or $50.99 per share, at December 31, 2021.

The annualized adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact* in the fourth quarter was 12.9%.AFLAC JAPANIn yen terms, Aflac Japan's net earned premiums were ¥306.1 billion for the quarter, or 4.1% lower than a year ago, mainly due to limited pay products reaching paid-up status and slightly declining inforce. Adjusted net investment income decreased 1.7% to ¥86.2 billion, mainly due to lower variable investment income. Total adjusted revenues in yen declined 3.6% to ¥393.3 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings in yen for the quarter declined 0.4% on a reported basis to ¥100.5 billion, primarily due to decreased revenues offset by lower benefits recognized during the quarter.

For the full year, total new sales were essentially flat at ¥54.8 billion, or $416 million, reflecting constrained sales in the first half of the year due to ongoing pandemic conditions offset by a new cancer product launch and first sector product updates in the second half of the year.AFLAC U.S.Aflac U.S. net earned premiums declined 0.2% to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, impacted by lower persistency. Adjusted net investment income decreased 2.5% to $192 million, largely due to lower variable investment income. Total adjusted revenues were up 0.1% to $1.6 billion.

For the full year, total new sales increased 16.1% to $1.5 billion.CORPORATE AND OTHER For the quarter, total adjusted revenues increased 325.7% to $79 million, primarily due to higher adjusted net investment income resulting from lower federal tax credit investments, higher interest rates, and an increase in amortized hedge income, partially offset by a reduction in total premiums as a result of significant yen weakening. Pretax adjusted earnings were a loss of $44 million, compared with a loss of $155 million a year ago, primarily reflecting an increase in adjusted net investment income.For the full year, total adjusted revenues increased 52.6% to $267 million, primarily due to a $114 million increase in adjusted net investment income, partially offset by a reduction in total premiums as a result of significant yen weakening. Pretax adjusted earnings were a loss of $223 million, compared with a loss of $298 million a year ago.DIVIDEND AND CAPITAL RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERSThe board of directors declared the first quarter dividend of $0.42 per share, payable on March 1, 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2023.In the fourth quarter, Aflac Incorporated deployed $600 million in capital to repurchase 8.9 million of its common shares. For the full year, the company deployed $2.4 billion in capital to repurchase 39.2 million of its common shares. At the end of December 2022, the company had 116.6 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase.OUTLOOK Commenting on the company's results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: ""When adjusting for a material weakening in the yen, Aflac delivered another quarter of solid earnings results capping off a year of overall strong performance. Pandemic conditions in Japan are gradually improving, but impacted operations throughout the year, while in the U.S. they have largely subsided.""Looking at our operations in Japan, I am encouraged by the sales increase of 11.4% in the fourth quarter and 10.8% in the second half of the year, which reflected a new cancer product launch and first sector product updates. Persistency remained strong in the fourth quarter. We continue to monitor evolving pandemic conditions, which resulted in a slow start to 2022. The slow start negatively impacted sales for the full year, but we are working to build on the momentum we experienced in the quarter as we look to 2023. As anticipated, our benefit ratio returned to a more normal level in the fourth quarter. ""In the U.S., I am pleased with the 17.4% sales increase in the fourth quarter and 16.1% sales increase for the year. This reflects continued improvement in the productivity of our agents and brokers as well as contribution from the buildout of our acquired platforms, namely network dental and vision and group life and disability. We continue to work toward reinforcing our leading position and building our momentum into 2023.""As always, we are committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. We continue to generate strong investment results while remaining in a defensive position as we monitor evolving economic conditions. In addition, we have taken proactive steps in recent years to defend cash flow and deployable capital against a weakening yen. With the fourth quarter's declaration, 2022 marked the 40th consecutive year of dividend increases. We treasure our track record of dividend growth and remain committed to extending it, supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows. At the same time, we remain in the market repurchasing shares with a tactical approach, focused on integrating the growth investments we have made in our platform to improve our strength and leadership position.""*See Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures section for an explanation of foreign exchange and its impact on the financial statements and definitions of the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures used in this earnings release, as well as a reconciliation of such non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.ABOUT AFLAC INCORPORATEDAflac Incorporated (NYSE: AFL) is a Fortune 500 company helping provide protection to more than 50 million people through its subsidiaries in Japan and the U.S., paying cash fast when policyholders get sick or injured.

The financial measures exclude items that the Company believes may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in insurance operations because they tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with insurance operations.Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where the functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on reported results. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. Consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current period results in relation to the comparable prior period, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current period results in relation to the comparable prior period. A significant portion of the Company's business is conducted in yen and never converted into dollars but translated into dollars for U.S. GAAP reporting purposes, which results in foreign currency impact to earnings, cash flows and book value on a U.S. GAAP basis. Management evaluates the Company's financial performance both including and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation to monitor, respectively, cumulative currency impacts and the currency-neutral operating performance over time. The average yen/dollar exchange rate is based on the published MUFG Bank, Ltd. telegraphic transfer middle rate (TTM).The company defines the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release as follows:Adjusted earnings are adjusted revenues less benefits and adjusted expenses. Adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are the adjusted earnings for the period divided by the weighted average outstanding shares (basic or diluted) for the period presented. The adjustments to both revenues and expenses account for certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside management's control. Adjusted revenues are U.S. GAAP total revenues excluding adjusted net investment gains and losses. Adjusted expenses are U.S. GAAP total acquisition and operating expenses including the impact of interest cash flows from derivatives associated with notes payable but excluding any nonrecurring or other items not associated with the normal course of the Company's insurance operations and that do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance. Management uses adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share to evaluate the financial performance of the Company's insurance operations on a consolidated basis and believes that a presentation of these financial measures is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of the Company's insurance business. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are net earnings and net earnings per share, respectively.Adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact are computed using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable prior-year period, which eliminates fluctuations driven solely by foreign currency exchange rate changes. Adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact is adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact important because a significant portion of the Company's business is conducted in Japan and foreign exchange rates are outside management's control; therefore, the Company believes it is important to understand the impact of translating foreign currency (primarily Japanese yen) into U.S. dollars. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact are net earnings and net earnings per share, respectively.Adjusted return on equity is adjusted earnings divided by average shareholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). Management uses adjusted return on equity to evaluate the financial performance of the Company's insurance operations on a consolidated basis and believes that a presentation of this financial measure is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of the Company's insurance business. The Company considers adjusted return on equity important as it excludes components of AOCI, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management's control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted return on equity is return on average equity (ROE) as determined using net earnings and average total shareholders' equity.Adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact is adjusted earnings excluding the current period foreign currency impact divided by average shareholders' equity, excluding AOCI. The Company considers adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact important as it excludes changes in foreign currency and components of AOCI, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management's control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact is ROE as determined using net earnings and average total shareholders' equity.Amortized hedge costs/income represent costs/income incurred or recognized as a result of using foreign currency derivatives to hedge certain foreign exchange risks in the Company's Japan segment or in Corporate and other. These amortized hedge costs/ income are estimated at the inception of the derivatives based on the specific terms of each contract and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the hedge. The Company believes that amortized hedge costs/income measure the periodic currency risk management costs/income related to hedging certain foreign currency exchange risks and are an important component of net investment income. There is no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for amortized hedge costs/ income.Adjusted book value is the U.S. GAAP book value (representing total shareholders' equity), less AOCI as recorded on the U.S. GAAP balance sheet. Adjusted book value per common share is adjusted book value at the period end divided by the ending outstanding common shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted book value and adjusted book value per common share important as they exclude AOCI, which fluctuates due to market movements that are outside management's control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted book value and adjusted book value per common share are total book value and total book value per common share, respectively.Adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses is adjusted book value plus unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses. Adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses per common share is adjusted book value plus unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses at the period end divided by the ending outstanding common shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses, and its related per share financial measure, important as they exclude certain components of AOCI, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management's control; however, it includes the impact of foreign currency as a result of the significance of Aflac's Japan operation. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses and adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses per common share are total book value and total book value per common share, respectively.Adjusted net investment income is net investment income adjusted for i) amortized hedge cost/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and certain derivative activity, and ii) net interest cash flows from foreign currency and interest rate derivatives associated with certain investment strategies, which are reclassified from net investment gains and losses to net investment income. The Company considers adjusted net investment income important because it provides a more comprehensive understanding of the costs and income associated with the Company's investments and related hedging strategies. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted net investment income is net investment income.Adjusted net investment gains and losses are net investment gains and losses adjusted for i) amortized hedge cost/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and certain derivative activity, ii) net interest cash flows from foreign currency and interest rate derivatives associated with certain investment strategies, which are both reclassified to net investment income, and iii) the impact of interest cash flows from derivatives associated with notes payable, which is reclassified to interest expense as a component of total adjusted expenses. The Company considers adjusted net investment gains and losses important as it represents the remainder amount that is considered outside management's control, while excluding the components that are within management's control and are accordingly reclassified to net investment income and interest expense. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted net investment gains and losses is net investment gains and losses.RECONCILIATION OF NET EARNINGS TO ADJUSTED EARNINGS(UNAUDITED – IN

Widodo blamed Freeport's smelter delay on the pandemic.Freeport Indonesia said last week its copper output in 2023 is seen at about 1.6 billion pounds (725,748 tonnes).

Evernorth, Cigna’s largest segment, includes a broad range of coordinated and point solution health services that include pharmacy services, benefits management, care solutions, and data analytics provided to health plans, employers, government organizations, and healthcare providers.Cigna’s other primary segment, Cigna Healthcare, comprises Cigna’s U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government, and International Health businesses that provide comprehensive medical and coordinated solutions to clients and customers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs for Regeneron, it offers investors unique exposure to biomedicine with the company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of treatments targeting serious medical conditions. Regeneron’s portfolio includes nine marketed drugs that treat serious eye diseases, asthma, arthritis, and lung cancer, among other diseases and health conditions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCigna Quarterly EstimatesCigna’s fourth-quarter earnings are expected at $4.84 per share, which would be up 1% from Q4 2021. Sales are forecasted to be virtually flat year over year for Q4 at $45.58 billion. This would round out Cigna’s fiscal 2022 with earnings up 13% at $23.14 per share and total sales rising 3% to $180.34 billion.Story continuesPlus, FY23 earnings are projected to rise another 7% to $24.81 per share with sales expected to jump another 5%. Even better, FY23 sales projections of $189.41 billion would represent 289% growth over the last five years with 2018 sales at $48.65 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegeneron Quarterly Estimates Pivoting to Regeneron, Q4 earnings are projected at $9.68 per share, a -59% decline from Q4 2021 EPS of $23.72 a share after an outstanding prior-year quarter. Fourth quarter sales are expected to be down -36% year over year to $3.17 billionRegeneron would round out fiscal 2022 with EPS at $42.50 compared to its mind-boggling earnings of $74.66 a share in 2021. Fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to dip another -3%. Total sales for fiscal 2022 would be down - 26% at $11.84 billion but are expected to rise 4% in FY23.More impressive, fiscal 2023 sales projections of $12.34 billion would still be an 84% increase over the last five years with 2018 sales at $6.71 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance &amp; Valuation Both Cigna and Regeneron stocks have indeed been valuable investments in terms of defensive safety acting as a hedge against inflation. Over the last year, Cigna stock is up +36% Vs. Regeneron’s +21% as both largely outperformed the S&amp;P 500’s -14% with the Nasdaq down -19%.Furthermore, in the last decade, Cigna’s +405% and Regeneron’s +354% have also topped the performance of the broader indexes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $313 per share and just 12.7X forward earnings, Cigna stock continues to stand out from a valuation standpoint. Shares of Cigna trade 37% beneath its decade-long high of 20.3X and are on par with the median of 12.4X.At around $758 a share and 20.6X forward earnings, Regeneron stock also trades attractively relative to its past. Shares of Regeneron trade 76% below its decade-long high of 86.4X and at a 24% discount to the median of 27X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line With healthcare insurance and biomedicine being very lucrative areas of the economy in terms of growth investors may want to consider adding Cigna and Regeneron stocks to their portfolios as they have continued to outperform the broader market.More importantly, the guidance and outlook the companies are able to give during the fourth quarter reports will give insight into the possibility of their strong performances and growth continuing with Cigna stock sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment and Regeneron landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

America, which has the largest and most developed corporate sector in the world (even the universe maybe, unless NASA finds aliens), is full of companies that disrupted industries and become corporate giants — even closing in on the African continent's GDP when it comes to market capitalization. Africa's nominal GDP is slated to be $3.14 trillion by 2023 according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), while the two most valuable American firms — Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) — have a combined market capitalization of $4.16 trillion.Both have led the charge and transformed entire industries. For Apple, its biggest strength is the manufacturing supply chain that enables it to pump out millions of iPhones each year. For Microsoft,  it has been the ability to target the highest growing industries and become a dominant player in them. The best example of this is the Azure cloud computing and data center platform, which grew 40% on a YoY basis in the second quarter of 2022.Marcin Balcerzak/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has taken a wager at trying to identify the smartest companies in the world.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report.

The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Regeneron (REGN) earns a Zacks Rank #3 two days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 3, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $10.09 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $10.09 Most Accurate Estimate and the $9.68 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Regeneron has an Earnings ESP of 4.23%.REGN is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Gilead Sciences (GILD).Gilead Sciences, which is readying to report earnings on February 2, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.53 a share, and GILD is one day out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gilead Sciences is $1.50, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.71%.Story continuesREGN and GILD's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. In light of that, when we looked at Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Union Pacific, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$9.9b ÷ (US$65b - US$5.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Union Pacific has an ROCE of 17%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 14% generated by the Transportation industry. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Union Pacific compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Union Pacific.How Are Returns Trending?Over the past five years, Union Pacific's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at Union Pacific in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. This probably explains why Union Pacific is paying out 45% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Union Pacific's ROCEIn summary, Union Pacific isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Since the stock has gained an impressive 85% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.Like most companies, Union Pacific does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

509,0cecd974-f92f-38b7-bc09-0af362c35573,UNP,2023-02-02,7 Industrial Stocks That Will Be Big Winners,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-industrial-stocks-big-winners-203759511.html,1675024679,STORY,"['UPS', 'LMT', 'PCAR', 'UNP', 'DOV', 'CLF']","[On the surface, it may seem as if now’s not the time to buy industrial stocks. With macro issues still unresolved, and the threat of a 2023 global recession still looming, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the near-term operational performance of companies in the industrial sector.However, that uncertainty is not a reason to sit on the sidelines. For starters, for some stocks, high uncertainty equals favorable opportunity. That is, there are plenty of cyclical industrials still trading at heavily discounted valuations, as their prospects remain murky. Some stocks in this category have become overly discounted, creating a favorable risk/reward proposition.In other cases, there are industrial names currently benefiting from more positive trends. For example, companies with exposure to recent geopolitical conflicts, as well as companies with exposure to secular growth trends. Between these two categories, there are plenty of industrial stocks worth buying in today’s market, including these seven. All of them are reasonably-priced, and have catalysts that could each one to “crush it” in the years ahead.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCLFCleveland-Cliffs$21.62DOVDover$144.98LMTLockheed Martin$459.60PCARPACCAR$110.63SQMSociedad Química y Minera de Chile$94.61UNPUnion Pacific$202.39UPSUnited Parcel Service$182.09Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comCleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) has traded wildly over the past twelve months. Skyrocketing on the heels of the commodities supply shock caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine early last year, this steel stock gave back most of its gains (and then some), thanks to poor quarterly results.However, investors have responded favorably to the company’s recent price hikes for steel products. As the company supplies steel based on fixed price contracts, these price increases point to higher profitability going forward. Although analyst forecasts call for Cleveland-Cliffs to earn just $1.99 per share this year, and $2.26 per share in 2024, increased steel prices, plus a rebound in automotive demand, could mean much better-than-expected results. On a longer timeframe, as InvestorPlace’s Larry Ramer recently argued, the forthcoming infrastructure spending boom could provide a further boost for the CLF stock price.Story continuesDover (DOV)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comDover (NYSE:DOV) may be best known for its “dividend king” status. This industrial conglomerate has increased its dividend payouts an impressive 66 years in a row. Yet besides its steady, growing quarterly payouts (current forward yield of 1.41%), there’s another reason why DOV is one of the best industrial stocks to buy.Trading for 17.8 times earnings, DOV stock trades at a discount to industrial conglomerate peers like Danaher (NYSE:DHR) and Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW), which trade for 27.6 and 26.1 times earnings, respectively. Sure, one may argue this is due to low expected earnings growth for DOV. Yet while earnings growth is expected to slow in 2023, analyst forecasts call for around 9.3% earnings growth in 2024. A resumption of earnings growth, plus a modest amount of multiple expansion, could mean strong price appreciation for DOV in the years ahead.Lockheed Martin (LMT)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chartSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comOutperforming the market in 2022, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) continues to perform well. With geopolitical uncertainty serving as a tailwind, the LMT stock could continue to stay strong, as the company continues to report solid results. As seen in recent headlines, Lockheed Martin continues to secure big-ticket contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, such a recent $656.77 million contract win by its Sikorsky aircraft unit.Alongside the prospect of steady results, LMT remains appealing thanks to its dividend policy. Raising its payout annually over the past twenty years, the company recently raised it again, to $3 per share quarterly. This gives LMT stock a forward yield of 2.61%.PACCAR (PCAR)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comOver the last few months, shares of Paccar (NASDAQ:PCAR) have been recovering nicely. That’s not surprising, given that this commercial truck manufacturer continues to beat expectations with its quarterly results, despite the overhanging fears of an economic slowdown, which in theory could impact demand for its products. Admittedly, some analysts are hesitant about PCAR stock, after its hot run over the past few months. For instance, analysts at Credit Suisse earlier this month stressed that Paccar’s rally may not be sustainable, as economic challenges could start to affect results in 2023.However, with shares trading for just 13 times earnings, even as shares have surged, the risk of an earnings slowdown could still be accounted-for in its valuation. Don’t forget, either, that Paccar has “green wave” catalysts as well. The company is working on the technology necessary to make battery electric and hydrogen-powered versions of its semi-trucks.Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comSociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) may not be a household name in the United States, but plenty of American investors have caught onto the opportunity with the U.S.-listed shares of this Chilean-based industrial company. That’s mostly, due to its high exposure to the lithium boom. Better, with lithium demand expected to climb with the electric vehicle boom, this leading miner of lithium is poised to continue experiencing strong growth for years to come.With this, SQM stock isn’t only one of the top industrial stocks out there. As Louis Navellier put it earlier this month, it’s also one of the best large-cap stocks to buy for the long haul. Besides the long growth runway, other factors that make this stock a strong buy-and-hold opportunity are its low earnings multiple (8.7), and its high dividend yield (9.51%).Union Pacific (UNP)Source: ShutterstockAmong stocks in the industrial sector, railroads may be some of the most appealing out there. There are several large publicly-traded U.S. Class 1 railroads out there you can buy, but Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) in particular stands out, namely for the two ways it is returning capital to shareholders. Why? First, UNP stock offers a slightly-higher dividend compared to peers like CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC). UNP’s forward yield currently comes in at 2.58%, versus 1.33% for CSX, and 2.24% for NSC.Second, UNP is aggressively buying back shares. Last year, it initiated a new share repurchase program. Through 2025, the company is authorized by its board to repurchase up to 100 million shares. Given this railroad has 642.88 million shares outstanding, this could have a tremendous impact on earnings per share (or EPS), and UNP’s stock price.United Parcel Service (UPS)white keyboard with ""buy"" written on a green enter key (stocks to buy)Source: ShutterstockTo cap off this list of top industrial stocks, let’s look at another high-profile transportation stock: United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). The current economic slowdown has had an impact on the performance of shares in this package transportation company.Surging during 2020 and 2021, as the pandemic’s “stay at home economy” boosted results, UPS stock has moved lower since 2022, when pandemic headwinds dissipated, and macro headwinds emerged. That said, as I argued earlier this month, this uncertainty has pushed shares to a low valuation.At today’s prices, UPS trades for only 14.1 times earnings. For most of the past ten years, this top transportation stock has traded for between 15 and 20 times earnings.

Earnings have increased year over year, albeit at a slower pace than revenues. Inflationary headwinds, supply chain challenges and labor shortages, however, continued for the sector, hurting the bottom line amid recovering demand for medical products and services. Per the latest Earnings Preview, 8.9% of the companies in the Medical sector, comprising 28.4% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings till Jan 25. Of these, 80% beat earnings estimates, while 20% surpassed revenue estimates. Earnings increased 5% year over year on 7% higher revenues.This scorecard highlights the Medical sector’s continued resilience amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Throughout the fourth quarter, the companies saw rising demand for surgery-related procedures. However, most players in the industry were reeling under continued inflationary pressure across the world. Mounting raw material costs, labor-supply constraints and supply-chain disruptions hampered the entire production and distribution process. Meanwhile, an increase in the prices of products and services is likely to have aided the Medical sector.Overall, fourth-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to decline 10.9%, while sales are expected to increase 2.9%. This compares with the third-quarter reported earnings decline of 3.3% and revenue growth of 5.1%.Medical Device Quarterly SynopsysIntegral to the broader Medical sector, Medical Device companies’ collective business growth is likely to have recorded an improvement compared with the last year, with a significant reduction in COVID-led fatality across the United States and other developed countries. Added to this, notable Medical Device players have been undertaking consistent efforts to mitigate staffing shortages that have disrupted business growth since the pandemic’s beginning. These factors are likely to have been advantageous for the base businesses of Medical Device stocks.Story continuesYet, Medical Device companies continue to be burdened by the global shortage of semiconductors chips that produce life-saving medical equipment like pacemakers, blood-pressure monitors, insulin pumps and defibrillators. This ongoing challenge is expected to have significantly hampered performance across several businesses in the Medical Device industry in Q4.Overall, the rebound in the base business through the months of the fourth quarter is expected to have been impressive. Medical Device companies like Becton Dickinson and Company BDX, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated DGX and CONMED Corporation CNMD are likely to have shown improvement in revenues, while margins are likely to have been hurt.Let’s take a look at the MedTech players scheduled to announce results on Feb 2.Becton Dickinson: Becton Dickinson’s Life Science segment has been registering strong growth across both Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences business units, despite supply constraints. This is likely to have significantly driven up segmental revenues. BD Research Cloud and CerTest VIASURE Monkeypox molecular research use-only assay are likely to have aided top-line growth during the quarter. However, the continued decline in COVID-only testing revenues is likely to have weighed on BD’s Life Sciences segmental revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Strong growth in Peripheral Intervention sales, and Urology and Critical Care revenues are likely to have aided BD Interventional segment revenues.

The Dow Jones Market Data added that the S&amp;P 500 has soared 6.2% so far this year, notching its best January gains since 2019. Lest we forget, the broader index, particularly, had a painful 2022, with the index tanking nearly 20% and registering its worst annual performance since the financial crisis way back in 2008.The Dow, meanwhile, gained 2.8% for the month of January, and the tech-laden Nasdaq surged 10.7%, marking its best January performance since 2001, added the Dow Jones Market Data. Interestingly, the rally in tech comes despite bigwigs executing layoffs and other cost-cutting measures.A slowdown in U.S. pay growth gave upside support for stocks. Per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, wages and benefits increased by 1% in the final three months of 2022, but that’s less than the 1.2% increase during the July-September quarter.Thus, a slowdown in wage growth is expected not to fuel inflation higher and has given assurance that the Federal Reserve won’t be accelerating its interest rate hikes this year. Needless to say, the rate hikes last year to tame sky-high inflation had increased the cost of borrowing, curtailed consumer spending, and derailed economic growth.Last year, in December, interest rates were hiked by 50- basis- points, which followed a 75-basis-point increase four times consecutively. But now market pundits are expecting a rate increase by only 25 basis points this month. This is primarily because inflation has started to show signs of cooling off, with the consumer price index advancing by 6.5% year-over-year in December, down from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June.The International Monetary Fund (IMF), by the way, now expects global economic growth to increase by 2.9% this year, more than its October estimate of a 2.7% rise. The IMF believes that an upbeat labor market, improvement in consumption patterns, and the reopening of the Chinese economy following the coronavirus pandemic would surely boost economic growth and crush recessionary concerns. IMF’s upbeat outlook on global economic growth too drove stocks higher and gave enough hope that the rally will last for the rest of 2023.Story continuesGiven such bullishness, we have highlighted five stocks that have not only made the most of the January rally but also are poised to gain further this year, banking on a less aggressive Fed and better global economic growth prospects. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

This means being mindful of how our products are made and used and taking steps to address potential negative impacts. Cisco strives to design and build technology in ways that respect human rights, promote inclusion, and protect privacy and security-so that everyone can benefit from a more connected world.Cisco Systems Inc., Wednesday, February 1, 2023, Press release pictureWhen it comes to Powering an Inclusive Future for All, respect for human rights is a fundamental innovation principle. Privacy, security, and inclusion must be central in the design methodology, especially when it comes to artificial intelligence and machine learning. Training data sets often determine how product design and user experience take shape-the adage ""goodness in, goodness out"" certainly applies. Developers must take steps to ensure these data sets are robust, diverse, and representative of all users. Failing to do so can result in inaccuracies, disappointing user experiences, and unintended bias.Take, for example, Webex virtual backgrounds, which are designed to hide users' surroundings to enhance privacy, security, professionalism, and fun. Early research versions of this feature, which reflected the state of the art at the time, did not perform well for certain hair textures and styles, or lighting conditions. In some cases, they inadvertently filtered out portions of a user's appearance. Our engineers recognized that broader, more diverse training data sets that were representative of the Webex user base were required, and addressed this during the design phase before releasing the feature. By applying data that was anonymized, ethically sourced, user-contributed, open-source, provided with explicit consent, and respectful of individual privacy in other ways, we made the training data more robust. This resulted in more representative images and algorithms, and a much better and more inclusive user experience for all.Story continuesIn 2022, we built on the learnings from the Webex team and launched our Responsible AI Framework based on six principles: Transparency, Fairness, Accountability, Privacy, Security, and Reliability. Our Responsible AI Working Group continuously drives adherence to these principles by putting new technologies through Responsible AI Impact Assessments, offering guidance on how to manage risk to human rights, and providing accountability via incident reporting of human rights, privacy, and security concerns.To learn more about the progress we're making to power a more inclusive future, visit our Cisco ESG Reporting Hub, where you can read our 2022 Cisco Purpose Report.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/737672/Valuing-Privacy-and-Inclusion-in-Software-Design]"
