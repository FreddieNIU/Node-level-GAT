0,07d041a6-b3ea-3dee-8548-587c8026b302,SCHW,2023-02-12,Investing in Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) three years ago would have delivered you a 77% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-charles-schwab-nyse-schw-120029148.html,1676203229,STORY,"['SCHW', 'SCHW-PD', 'SCHW-PJ']","[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) shareholders have seen the share price rise 70% over three years, well in excess of the market return (19%, not including dividends).So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for Charles Schwab To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Charles Schwab achieved compound earnings per share growth of 9.7% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 19% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Charles Schwab's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Charles Schwab the TSR over the last 3 years was 77%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThe total return of 8.6% received by Charles Schwab shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -8.4%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 10%, each year, over five years. If the stock price has been impacted by changing sentiment, rather than deteriorating business conditions, it could spell opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  Charles Schwab is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Charles Schwab is not the only stock insiders are buying.

2,88480a9d-b91a-3012-8ab6-a5765667a38d,TXN,2023-02-12,7 Dividend Stocks to Buy for a Reliable Income Stream,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-stocks-buy-reliable-100722471.html,1675937242,STORY,"['JNJ', 'SNA', 'UPS', 'CSCO', 'DOX', 'TSCO', 'TXN']","[With 2022 featuring a deluge of red ink, the temptation this year centers on scooping up popular names for cheap. Though investors shouldn’t ignore the relatively boring option of dividend stocks to buy. True, companies that provide reliable passive income don’t generate much excitement. However, with so many variables ahead of the markets, a dull but dependable route may be more prudent.For this list of dividend stocks to buy, every company features a payout ratio – or the proportion of earnings a company pays its shareholders via dividends – below 70%. As well, each enterprise carries a consensus rating among analysts of moderate buy or its equivalent. That way, prospective investors can also enjoy capital gains potential.TXNTexas Instruments$176.50UPSUnited Parcel Service$186.36DOXAmdocs$95.21TSCOTractor Supply$231.24SNASnap-on$251.20JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$163.61CSCOCisco$46.96InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTexas Instrument (TXN)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comOne of the top technology firms in the nation, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally. So far, TXN has avoided the wild volatility that impacted its peers. In the trailing year, shares gained over 6%. In contrast, the Nasdaq Composite index dropped nearly 15% during the same period.Currently, Texas Instruments carries a forward yield of 2.7%. This ranks conspicuously above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Further, its payout ratio pings at 59.28%. As well, the company commands 19 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Therefore, it’s unlikely that management will give up this trend without a fight.Financially, Texas Instruments features a stable balance sheet (an Altman Z-Score of 12.85) and excellent profitability margins. These attributes may have contributed to Wall Street analysts rating TXN as a consensus moderate buy. Further, TipRanks notes that hedge fund sentiment rates as “positive.” Therefore, it offers a solid choice among dividend stocks to buy.Story continuesUnited Parcel Service (UPS)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA stalwart in the shipping and receiving industry, United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) represents a critical cog in the broader supply chain management complex. Admittedly, though, circumstances have been challenging for UPS amid 2022’s spike in inflation. However, the situation appears to be turning around, with shares gaining over 7% since the January opener.Presently, UPS carries a forward yield of 3.44%. This rates better than the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. Notably, the company’s payout ratio is 52.73%. In addition, UPS features 14 years of consecutive dividend increases.Despite wider challenges, UPS commands a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.4%, outpacing 75% of the competition. Also, its net margin stands at 11.51%, beating over 68% of its rivals.Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg UPS as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target is $194.94, implying potential upside of 3.53%. While not particularly exciting, UPS ranks among the dividend stocks to buy this year.Amdocs (DOX)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockA multinational software firm, Amdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) specializes in software and services for communications, media and financial services providers and digital enterprises. Contrary to many of its tech peers, Amdocs performed very well in 2022. For instance, in the trailing 365 days, DOX gained nearly 22%. It’s still up almost 4% since the January opener.At the moment, DOX carries a forward yield of 1.83%. Though not the highest yield, it still rates better than the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, Amdocs features a low payout ratio of 26.75%, meaning investors can depend on it for reliable passive income. Plus, the company enjoys 10 consecutive years of dividend increases.Financially, DOX might attract investors for its value proposition. The market prices shares at a forward multiple of 16.77. As a discount to forward earnings, Amdocs ranks better than 72%.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg DOX as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $99, implying 4% upside potential. Combined with its strong market performance, DOX represents one of the dividend stocks to buy.Tractor Supply (TSCO)7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right NowSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee, Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) is an American retail chain of stores that sells products for various purposes. These include home improvement, agriculture, lawn and garden maintenance, livestock, equine and pet care for recreational farmers and ranchers, pet owners, and landowners.Although a boring entry among dividend stocks to buy, Tractor did what it does best: keep the ship afloat. In the trailing year, shares gained nearly 5%. While not particularly impressive, it’s a heckuva lot better than falling into negative territory.Presently, Tractor Supply carries a forward yield of 1.58%. To be fair, this slips a bit below the consumer discretionary sector’s average yield of 1.89%. However, the payout ratio sits at 31.69%, making TSCO one of the more dependable dividend stocks to buy.Finally, Wall Street analysts assess TSCO as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target pings at $245.78, implying upside potential of almost 6%.Snap-on (SNA)dividend stocks: A calculator projecting the word ""DIVIDEND"" rests on a pile of gold and silver coins.Source: ShutterstockNot to be confused with the similar-sounding social media firm, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) is an American designer, manufacturer and marketer of high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry. These sectors included the automotive, heavy duty, equipment, marine, aviation and railroad industries.Though another boring behind-the-shadows example of dividend stocks to buy, SNA proves that boring can be profitable. In the trailing year, shares gained nearly 20% of equity value. Further, since the Jan. opener, SNA moved up 11%.At time of writing, Snap-on carries a forward yield of 2.55%. This rates higher than the consumer discretionary sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Further, the payout ratio sits at 36.65%, making it one of the reliable dividend stocks to buy. As well, Snap-on enjoys 13 years of consecutive dividend increases.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg SNA as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $281, implying upside potential of over 10%.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Source: ShutterstockFounded in 1886, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) represents an American icon. As a business enterprise, Johnson &amp; Johnson develops medical devices, pharmaceuticals and consumer packaged goods. However, JNJ hasn’t posted a great performance recently. In the trailing year, it fell nearly 5%. And since the January opener, JNJ faces a deficit of more than 8%.Nevertheless, this may open the door for contrarians to pick up one of the dividend stocks to buy on discount. Currently, the healthcare giant carries a forward yield of 2.77%. This ranks notably higher than the underlying sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Also, its payout ratio of 41.5% provides prospective investors with confidence. Lastly, regarding the passive income, it’s on a 61-year consecutive streak of dividend increases.Looking to Wall Street, analysts peg JNJ as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $186.11, implying upside potential of nearly 14%.Cisco Systems (CSCO)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in San Jose, California, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a digital communications technology conglomerate. Per its website, Cisco develops, manufactures, and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment and other high-technology services and products. However, CSCO hasn’t been a great performer last year. In the trailing 365 days, CSCO lost almost 14% of equity value.Even in the year so far, Cisco presently posts unimpressive numbers, slipping a few basis points below parity. Nonetheless, for bargain hunters, CSCO may be one of the best dividend stocks to buy. Currently, the company offers a forward yield of 3.18%. In contrast, the tech sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%. Moreover, the payout ratio offers confidence, coming in just under 40%. Lastly regarding dividends, it features 12 years of consecutive payout increases.Right now, analysts peg CSCO as a consensus moderate buy. Additionally, their average price target stands at $54.70, implying upside potential of over 14%.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Eight other states currently have active legislation or ballot initiatives aimed at legalization, according to AGA. However, California’s most recent shot at sports gambling flopped, and legislation in Florida fell flat.On top of that, the race toward the top of the sports gambling hierarchy has proven pricey.Profitability concerns have consumed earnings calls for American-based mobile sportsbook operators like DraftKings (DKNG), Caesars Entertainment (CZR), MGM Resorts (MGM), Penn National (PENN), and Wynn (WYNN).Story continuesDraftKings, which is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 17, has already reported a $671.8 million adjusted EBITDA loss through the first three quarters of 2022.Philadelphia Eagles fans gathered on the steps of Montgomery County Courthouse for a pep rally in advance of Super Bowl LVI on February 10, 2023. (Photo by Mark Makela/Getty Images)Its competitor Caesars Digital unit, which includes Caesars Sportsbook, reported a $661 million loss in the same category for its first three quarters of the year.Most of those losses for Caesars trace back to the first quarter of 2022 when the company lost $554 million. Caesars promoted heavily leading up to last year’s Super Bowl, offering system credit match up to a deposit of $3,000. The operator also added a $300 bonus, meaning if a user deposited $3,000 into their account, they would have $3,300 of free play money courtesy of the sportsbook.This helped Caesars gain early market share, but it didn’t translate to sustained success. The company started the year ahead in monthly gross gaming revenue, per the New York State Commission, but finished 2022 handily in third place.""We're going to target our promotional spending at our profitable customers, which is going to be a much smaller subset of that larger group,"" Caesars CEO Reeg told investors after the first quarter.'It's going to continue to grow'Since adding customers at any cost hasn’t proven to be a sustainable model, industry leaders are steering customers toward areas where their sportsbook stands to profit more handsomely.Sportsbooks are heavily promoting their live betting offerings.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase Microchip Technology's shares on or after the 17th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 7th of March.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.36 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.43 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Microchip Technology has a trailing yield of approximately 1.7% on its current stock price of $82.6. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether Microchip Technology can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for Microchip Technology Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Microchip Technology paying out a modest 31% of its earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. The good news is it paid out just 20% of its free cash flow in the last year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see Microchip Technology has grown its earnings rapidly, up 57% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, Microchip Technology has increased its dividend at approximately 7.4% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpIs Microchip Technology an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We love that Microchip Technology is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about Microchip Technology, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.So while Microchip Technology looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Microchip Technology and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

(NASDAQ:ALGN) shareholders (or potential shareholders) will be happy to see that the President, Joseph Hogan, recently bought a whopping US$1m worth of stock, at a price of US$342. There's no denying a buy of that magnitude suggests conviction in a brighter future, although we do note that proportionally it only increased their holding by 1.6%. View our latest analysis for Align Technology Align Technology Insider Transactions Over The Last YearNotably, that recent purchase by President Joseph Hogan was not the only time they bought Align Technology shares this year. They previously made an even bigger purchase of US$2.0m worth of shares at a price of US$298 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of US$316. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. Happily, the Align Technology insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.Align Technology insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any.

Answer: Google.The long-running internet joke works because it is so believable. Microsoft’s search engine has been a punchline practically since its launch, always in the shadow of its wildly-popular and lucrative rival.Despite persistent efforts to dethrone it, Google’s search engine has become one of the most profitable inventions in history.The billions of queries logged each day on the service brought in $163bn (£135bn) for Google’s parent company last year. More than half of Alphabet’s sales came from the search engine despite a technology empire spanning smartphone software, YouTube and cloud computing.However, alarm bells are now ringing at the company’s Mountain View headquarters after Microsoft’s Bing, the butt of the joke, signed a landmark deal to integrate artificial intelligence engine ChatGPT.The announcement last week has triggered a “code red” at Google as its cash cow search engine comes under real threat, arguably for the first time in its history.Yet the company’s flat-footed response has exposed the growing sluggish nature of a business once regarded as Silicon Valley’s premier innovator. Mounting bureaucracy and bloat has left insiders complaining that it is becoming harder to get things done at Google and challenge the status quo.Bing rocketed to the top of the App Store download charts after its relaunch last week, threatening to consign Google to second place for the first time in its history.The old joke about Microsoft's search engine doesn’t seem so funny anymore.Satya Nadella's Microsoft is challenging Google's cash cow search engine for the first time - AP Photo/Stephen BrashearGoogle, which was launched on a Stanford university computer in 1996 and to the public two years later, has remained remarkably similar for two decades. A time travelling web user from 2000 would be baffled by Instagram, the iPhone and Alexa, but Google’s blue links would be instantly familiar. Largely, that is a function of its success.However, last week may be remembered as a turning point. On Tuesday, Microsoft unveiled an overhaul of Bing powered by an upgraded version of ChatGPT, the wildly popular artificial intelligence chatbot from the California start-up OpenAI.Story continuesThe revamped search service, first available as a preview before a wider release in the coming weeks, lets Bing users ask questions rather than just search. A simple, human-like answer is provided alongside the array of links.Ask Bing for holiday recommendations that are less than three hours away and it will suggest, in plain English, why you might want to try Malaga or Florence. Ask what budget TV you should buy and it will outline the pros and cons of the most popular models.Microsoft’s chief executive Satya Nadella said the launch marked a “new day for search”, and was unambiguous about his ambition for the product.“This new Bing will make Google come out and dance, and I want people to know that we made them dance,” he told technology website The Verge.Google is already scrambling. Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, has told staff that the chatbot is a “code red” moment, and even the company's hermit-like founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, have re-emerged to push for a response.The perception that Google is falling behind will be difficult to stomach at the company. After taking over from Brin and Page in 2015, Pichai sought to position Google as an “AI-first” organisation. The business pays handsomely to pluck the brightest engineers and researchers from university labs.It even had a big hand in the development of ChatGPT: the “T” in the name stands for Transformer, a machine learning system introduced to the world by Google’s AI lab in 2017. That the company enjoyed such a vast lead and has failed to capitalise will be troubling.Sundar Pichai - JOSH EDELSONUnder the leadership of Pichai, a McKinsey consultant before joining Google, a company that was once a model of youthful capitalism has faced growing criticism that its size and success has turned it into a risk-averse bureaucracy.Last month, employees circulated a memo comparing the company to “slime mould”.“Google is a place that prides itself on moving quickly to tackle world-scale problems,” the former employee behind the memo wrote.“But more recently it's started to feel way, way slower. Accomplishing even seemingly simple things seems to take forever.”The note outlined how a millefeuille of managers and departments held up new ideas at the company. Others say that new features are created but then forgotten, following a pattern of “Launch, Promote, Abandon” that explains why much-hyped projects in areas like cloud gaming and virtual reality fail to take off.Pichai acknowledged that the company had become bloated last month when he announced 12,000 job cuts, amounting to 6pc of parent company Alphabet's workforce. “We hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today,” Pichai said, adding that Google would “direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities.”Dysfunction has been most apparent within Google’s AI department. In 2020, hundreds of employees revolted when a researcher claimed she was fired for raising concerns about bias in AI. Last year, an engineer was fired for claiming that Google’s AI chatbot had become sentient. Former Googlers have started a string of chatbot start-ups, claiming that the company’s approach stifled their ideas.Insiders acknowledge that Google’s position means it is unable to launch products as rapidly as start-ups such as OpenAI. The company has been under immense political scrutiny over allegations it has broadcast misinformation and conspiracy theories about everything from elections to vaccines.It must tread carefully to avoid any perception of political bias and US Republicans have already turned on ChatGPT for answering queries about Joe Biden more positively than those about Trump.Microsoft’s tie-up with ChatGPT, the result of the Windows maker’s $10bn investment in OpenAI, has forced Google into action.Microsoft's Yusuf Mehdi outlined OpenAI's integration into Bing search last week - AP Photo / Stephen BrashearLast week, the company responded by announcing its own chatbot, named Bard, and confirming that its own search engine would feature chatbot-style results.In comparison to Microsoft’s slick launch, observers were left underwhelmed. Google announced merely that its technology was in testing. An event showing off some of its capabilities revealed little.Worse, a promotional image showed Bard delivering a wrong answer to a question about a Nasa telescope. The error only added to the impression that Google was struggling to play catch up. On the same day, shares fell by almost 8pc, wiping more than $100bn off the company’s value.Analysts brushed off last week’s early mishaps as mere ripples. “Google has been preparing for AI for years [and] we think [it] likely has superior technology for search,” said analysts at Bank of America.The company also has a significant head start, given millions of people around the world reach for Google as their default.“[Google’s web browser] Chrome is a moat for search, Android [Google's mobile operating system and smartphones] is a moat for search,” says Colin Hayhurst, the chief executive of British search engine Mojeek.“They’ve got agreements with the phone manufacturers, particularly Apple.”Google pays Apple an estimated $15bn a year to be the default search engine on the iPhone. While consumers can switch, few do.Even if Google emerges victorious, it could come at a great cost. Processing chatbot-style answers requires a vast amount of computing power, which comes at great expense. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that each natural language answer could cost Google up to 2 cents, five times more than the current cost of dealing with search queries. Answering half of searches with a chatbot could cost the company $6bn a year, equivalent to 10pc of 2022’s profit.Nor is it clear how advertising might work with chatbots. While drawing eyeballs to sponsored search results has made Google rich, inserting ads into human-sounding language is more tricky. Neither Microsoft nor Google are yet to outline exactly how they plan to incorporate adverts, although both are expected to do so.Google turns 25 this year, middle aged by Silicon Valley standards and older than many of its staff. With its search engine still largely unchanged, perhaps it's time for the product to grow up.]"

Compare that to the combined all-time high net profit of almost $180 billion from Chevron (CVX), ExxonMobil (XOM), Shell (SHEL), BP (BP), and TotalEnergies (TTE). The five Big Oil majors individually posted record annual net profit after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent crude prices close to $130 per barrel.""They made a ton of money benefitting from high crude oil and natural gas prices. They were in the right place at the right time."" Andy Lipow of Lipow Oil Associates recently wrote in a note to clients, noting the comparison with Big Tech profits.The energy industry's windfall is a reversal of fortune from two years ago. ""During the pandemic, when crude prices fell to $20 per barrel, they lost tons of money,"" said Lipow.'It's outrageous'Though Big Tech is often under antitrust scrutiny, Big Oil's record profit is repeatedly the target of politicians' criticism, especially from the White House.“You may have noticed that Big Oil just reported record profits,"" President Biden said during his State of The Union address this week. ""It’s outrageous. They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production and keep gas prices down.""Gasoline hit $5 per gallon last year before retreating but could be headed towards $4 again by April. This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.'Cautious Investing'Energy companies have been using their cash during boon times to pay down debt, and return money to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buyback programs.Story continues""Cautious investing Capital discipline has emerged as one of the most important themes in the energy sector,"" analyst Peter McNally of Third Bridge recently told investors.When Chevron announced a $75 billion buyback program in January, the move was quickly blasted by the White House. However Apple bought back almost $90 billion worth of its shares in its fiscal year 2022, which ended last September. Over the last decade, the tech giant has shelled out more than $550 billion to buy back its own stock.Last week Meta announced a $40 billion buyback program, despite a slowing ad revenue environment and recent layoffs.""It is fair to compare them [oil vs tech profits] because I think it's unfair, to go after the energy companies as much as the politicians do,"" Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak told Yahoo Finance.""It cost a boatload of money to invest in the extraction of oil,"" adding oil executives often ask ""Why would we do that if you're telling us that you're gonna put that stuff out of business?""In January, ExxonMobil announced capital and exploration expenses of $23 billion to $25 billion for 2023.Chevron expects to spend about $17 billion this year to explore and for production. That's about 25% more than in 2022. Last year the oil giant acquired Renewable Energy Group, a biodiesel production company, for $3.15 billion. The move though, is probably not enough to appease Big Oil critics, according to Third Bridge's McNally.""Chevron's $3 billion investment in U.S.-based Renewable Energy Group are unlikely to sway the White House,"" said McNally, noting Chevron's share buyback program is equivalent to more than four times its planned 2023 capital expenditure.Energy stocks far outperformed the broader markets in 2022, while technology and communication services equities fell. Though oil and gas companies may not repeat the record profits of last year, it's expected they will still do well this year.""Now that China, Europe, and the U.S. are in the midst of an economic recovery, as global demand rises, crude oil prices are expected to hit $100 per barrel in the upcoming months, and $120 per barrel prices are very possible during the summer months when there is peak demand,"" Louis Navellier of Navellier Investing told Yahoo Finance.""I overwhelmingly prefer energy stocks over technology stocks, simply because energy has much stronger forecasted revenue and earnings, plus continues to trade well below the PE ratio for the S&amp;P 500,"" he added.Ines is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

If you want to see more set-it-and-forget-it stocks to buy according to financial media, go directly to 5 Set-It-and-Forget-It Stocks to Buy According to Financial Media.Some stocks of leading companies are forever stocks in the eyes of many in the financial media.Those set-it-and-forget-it stocks have substantial scale and are very well known.They have been around for a while and they very likely will be around for a long time in the future too.Some of the leading companies rank among America's leading banks and thus are very important in terms of the American economy and the future of American growth. If America does well and those leading banks maintain their market share, those leading banks will likely do well in the long term.Some of the leading companies are what the financial media regards as 'Big Tech'. Those companies are huge profitable companies with substantial resources.Many of those big tech companies are also leaders in AI since they are the ones with the computing power, data, and financial resources.Companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are currently in an AI war, for instance. Late last year, OpenAI launched its ChatGPT AI chatbot which has offered substantial utility to many users even if it makes mistakes. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) previously invested $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019 and the company agreed to invest another $10 billion in 2023.Furthermore, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is planning to incorporate ChatGPT into Bing to potentially gain market share from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google.In response, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google is planning on launching multiple AI products this year, including its own AI search tool, Bard. Although Bard also makes mistakes, both will improve over time as the technology advances.Story continuesGiven its leading market share in cloud computing, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) likely will help power the computer processing of many AI applications in the future. Companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have invested substantial amounts into AI technologies and will likely have new AI incorporated products and services of their own in the future as well.Some other leading companies that the financial media likes are leading consumer staple conglomerates such as The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) that have long histories of increasing their annual dividends through multiple recessions.While the set-it-and-forget-it leading companies in the market have compelling qualities in the long term, they still have downside if the economy worsens or if their results do not meet expectations. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.AmazonPhoto by Bryan Angelo on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 10 Set-It-and-Forget-It Stocks to Buy According to Financial Media, we selected the stocks that have been highly regarded by the financial media as stocks that could do well in the long term.For those of you interested, check out 15 Stocks That Have Increased Their Dividends for Over 25 Years.10 Set-It-and-Forget-It Stocks to Buy According to Financial Media10. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $125.73 billionAlthough it isn't one of the big four biggest American banks, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is Wall Street's most prestigious investment bank. As a result, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is viewed by many in the financial media as the leading bank to the world's rich and powerful. Being a leading bank to the rich and powerful can be a pretty good business to be in the long term even if Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) employees are very well paid. In the last ten years, the stock of the leading investment bank has more than doubled. As of February 10, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) also has a dividend yield of 2.69%.Alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a set-it-and-forget-it stock to buy according to financial media.9. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $285.44 billionBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is one of the 'big four' American banks with a market capitalization of $285.44 billion, ranking #9 on our list of 10 Set-It-and-Forget-It Stocks to Buy According to Financial Media. Given its scale and importance in the financial sector, many in the financial media view big banks like Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) as systematically important. Although being systemically important doesn't mean good returns, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) nevertheless does also have substantial normalized earnings power and management is returning capital back to shareholders with a dividend yield of 2.47% as of 2/10. On average, analysts expect the bank to earn $3.12 per share for 2022, $3.48 per share in 2023, $3.76 per share in 2024, and $4.23 per share in 2025.8. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $326.18 billionThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is viewed by many in the financial media as a Dividend Aristocrat or a stock that has raised its annual dividend for at least 25 straight years. In terms of its dividend, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has actually raised its annual dividend for 67 straight years, meaning the leading consumer staple has been financially strong enough to increase payouts through multiple recessions. Although higher inflation has been a headwind for demand for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) recently, the company has long term earnings power if inflation normalizes.7. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $413.70 billionJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is regarded by many in the financial media as one of America's best big banks given the company's strong profitability and arguably great CEO in Jamie Dimon. Like Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a systemically important institution, giving it more importance in the media. Although an economic slowdown or recession could decrease earnings in the near term, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has long term EPS growth potential given its earnings power and eventual stock buybacks which could begin as early as this year.6. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $423.94 billionJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is viewed by the financial media as another leading Dividend Aristocrat that has increased its annual dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. In Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s case, the healthcare conglomerate has actually increased its annual dividend 61 consecutive years. Although shares of the stock are down 5.45% in the last year, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) increased its full year 2022 sales by 1.3% year over year to $94.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 3.6% year over year to $10.15 per share. Shares currently trade for a forward P/E of 14.84, which could be attractive in terms of the long term if the conglomerate maintains its market share.Like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are set-it-and-forget-it stocks to buy according to financial media.

That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Sysco Sysco Insider Transactions Over The Last YearNotably, that recent sale by Sheila Talton is the biggest insider sale of Sysco shares that we've seen in the last year. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$77.58, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 17% of Sheila Talton's holding.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Sysco better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Sysco Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Sysco. In total, Independent Director Sheila Talton sold US$191k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Does Sysco Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 0.2% of Sysco shares, worth about US$68m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Sysco Insiders?An insider sold Sysco shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Sysco makes money, and is growing profits. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. We'd practice some caution before buying! While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

Essentially, consumer goods represent anything that regular folks buy for personal use. This contrasts with capital goods, which companies utilize to produce other goods. Further, many of the businesses undergirding consumer goods stocks tend to feature some level of demand inelasticity. In other words, no matter what happens in the economy, people will continue to acquire certain products. Although it’s a cynical way to profit, it’s also incredibly effective. That might be even more so due to present troubling circumstances.For this list of intriguing publicly traded companies, we’re going to discuss financially stable enterprises that feature a consensus analyst opinion of moderate buy or its equivalent. So, without further ado, below are the most promising consumer goods stocks for 2023.INGRIngredion$101.74KOCoca-Cola$59.83UNFIUnited Natural Foods$42.15KRKroger$44.19ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$81.77BGBunge$99.66NATRNature’s Sunshine$9.34InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIngredion (INGR)Ingredion Canada Inc head office in Brampton, Ontario, CanadaSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comA multinational ingredient provider, Ingredion (NYSE:INGR) mainly produces starches, non-GMO sweeteners, stevia, and pea protein. For one of the consumer goods stocks – which tends to be a boring sector – INGR enjoyed a solid start. Since the Jan. opener, shares moved up over 3%. And in the trailing year, they gained nearly 17% of equity value.Although it’s not the most robust organization in terms of financials, Ingredion holds its own. On the balance sheet, the company posts an Altman Z-Score of 3.3, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate of 5.1% beats out the median stat of 4.5%. On the bottom line, Ingredion’s net margin of 5.77% ranks better than 65.28% of the competition.Looking to Wall Street, covering analysts peg INGR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $111.67, implying upside potential of nearly 11%. Also, sentiment among hedge funds rates as “very positive.”Story continuesCoca-Cola (KO)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA company that needs no introduction, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) represents more than just a name among consumer goods stocks. Rather, it’s emblematic of American-style capitalism. Further, during times of economic stress, Coca-Cola’s products provide cheap pick-me-ups. Despite its relevancies, KO stock presently provides a discount, shedding almost 5% of equity value since the January opener.Astute investors may want to consider picking up the discount. For one thing, Coca-Cola features an Altman Z-Score of 4.32, reflecting low bankruptcy risk and an overall stable balance sheet. Operationally, it’s three-year revenue growth rate of 3.7% beats out the median metric of 0.8%. Also, its free cash flow (FCF) growth during the same period stands at 22.4%, inside the top 25% of the industry.On the bottom line, Coca-Cola’s net margin hit 23.44%, outpacing over 94% of its rivals. As well, its return on equity (ROE) of nearly 43% reflects a high-quality business. According to covering analysts, KO ranks as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $67, implying upside potential of almost 12%.United Natural Foods (UNFI)On a white table sits bowls of nuts, fruit, and seeds, while vegetables like brocolli, carrots, and mushrooms sit on the tableSource: Tatjana Baibakova / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Providence, Rhode Island, United Natural Foods (NYSE:UNFI) is a natural and organic food company. So far, UNFI performed very well amid trying broader circumstances. Since the Jan. opener, UNFI gained over 11% of equity value. In the trailing year, shares moved up nearly 7%.To be fair, United Natural doesn’t feature the greatest attributes on its balance sheet. To its credit, though, it enjoys an Altman Z-Score of 4.5, reflecting low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, circumstances improve, with its three-year EBITDA growth rate jumping to 92.2%, ranked better than nearly 98% of the competition. Also, its ROE hit 13.7%, above over 65% of its peers.Perhaps most notably, the market prices UNFI at a forward multiple of 8.36. As a discount to earnings, United ranks better than nearly 90% of sector players. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg UNFI as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $48.60, implying nearly 14% upside potential. Thus, it makes for an intriguing case for consumer goods stocks to buy.Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comA supermarket and multi-department store operator, Kroger (NYSE:KR) represents one of the top dogs of consumer goods stocks to buy. Better yet, because the company focuses on the core essentials, Kroger should enjoy a basic level of economic insulation. Interestingly, though, KR stock sits at parity for the new year. In the trailing 365 days, KR actually dipped a bit more than 2%.Still, this may turn out to be nothing more than minor inconveniences in the end. Presently, Kroger enjoys a decently stable balance sheet, with an Altman Z-Score of 4.25 indicating low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, it gets the job done, with a three-year revenue growth rate of 6.4% beating out over 64% of rivals.What’s particularly enticing is the valuation proposition. Currently, the market prices KR at a forward multiple of 10.44. As a discount to earnings, Kroger ranks better than nearly 85% of the competition. Unsurprisingly, then, Wall Street analysts peg KR as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $52.57, implying over 18% upside potential.Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) is a multinational food processing and commodities trading firm. Mainly, the company processes cereal grains and oilseeds for use in food, beverage, nutraceutical, industrial and animal feed markets worldwide. In the trailing year, ADM gained nearly 8% of equity value. However, in the year so far, ADM dipped almost an identical number.However, astute investors may want to pick up ADM on discount. Consistently, it ranks among the enticing consumer goods stocks to buy. For instance, its Altman Z-Score hits 5.82, reflecting very low risk of bankruptcy. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate of 16.5% beats out nearly 83% of sector competitors. Also, its ROE stands at 18.25%, outpacing 83% of its rivals.Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg ADM as a consensus strong buy. As well, their average price target pings at $104.20, implying upside potential of slightly over 26%. Therefore, it’s easily one of the most promising consumer goods stocks to buy in 2023.Bunge (BG)A Photo of a blue sign in an industrial campus showing the Bunge (BG) logo.Source: JHVEPhoto/ShutterStock.comHeadquartered in Missouri, Bunge (NYSE:BG) is an agribusiness and food company. Well known for exporting soybeans, it’s also involved in food processing, grain trading and fertilizer. As you might suspect, it’s a rival to Archer Daniels Midland. In the year so far, BG gained almost 4% of equity value. However, in the trailing year, shares dipped about 2%.On the financials, Bunge offers decent stability in the balance sheet. Currently, its Altman Z-Score pings at 4.46, within the safe spectrum of fiscal resilience. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate of 6.3% is again decent, above the sector average of 4.5%. More notably, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period stands at 28.5%, outpacing 80.52% of its peers.Plus, the market prices BG at a forward multiple of 8.27. This compares very favorably to the industry median of 16.22, making it one of the most undervalued consumer goods stocks. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg BG as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target of $125.67 implies upside potential of 27%.Nature’s Sunshine (NATR)Couple shopping at grocery store together. Consumers. Consumer stocks.Source: Prostock-studio / ShutterstockAs a manufacturer and multi-level marketer (MLM) of dietary supplements, Nature’s Sunshine (NASDAQ:NATR) has exceptional risks. Primarily, MLMs don’t carry the greatest reputation. To be fair, Nature’s Sunshine from personal research doesn’t appear to be a predatory MLM network. Still, impressionable folks can get the wrong idea, leaving depleted finances and a bruised corporate brand.Taking that risk factor aside, the financials appear quite solid. For instance, Nature’s commands a cash-to-debt ratio of 2.85 times, ranking better than 74% of the competition. Also, its equity-to-asset ratio stands at 0.62 times, outpacing 63.44% of its rivals.Operationally, Nature’s benefits from excellent EBITDA growth during the past three years. As well, the company’s gross margin stands at 71.59%, outstanding compared to the underlying industry.Turning to Wall Street, NATR carries a single-analyst “consensus” view of moderate buy. However, the experts believes NATR will rise to $15. If so, that implies upside potential of nearly 60%, making it one of the best consumer goods stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:LUV)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-consider-buying-southwest-airlines-145354859.html,1676127234,STORY,['LUV'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$40.08 and falling to the lows of US$32.19. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Southwest Airlines' current trading price of US$34.57 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Southwest Airlines’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines What's The Opportunity In Southwest Airlines?Good news, investors! Southwest Airlines is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $55.92, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Southwest Airlines’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Southwest Airlines generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Southwest Airlines. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since LUV is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on LUV for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy LUV. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

If you want to see more set-it-and-forget-it stocks to buy according to financial media, go directly to 5 Set-It-and-Forget-It Stocks to Buy According to Financial Media.Some stocks of leading companies are forever stocks in the eyes of many in the financial media.Those set-it-and-forget-it stocks have substantial scale and are very well known.They have been around for a while and they very likely will be around for a long time in the future too.Some of the leading companies rank among America's leading banks and thus are very important in terms of the American economy and the future of American growth. If America does well and those leading banks maintain their market share, those leading banks will likely do well in the long term.Some of the leading companies are what the financial media regards as 'Big Tech'. Those companies are huge profitable companies with substantial resources.Many of those big tech companies are also leaders in AI since they are the ones with the computing power, data, and financial resources.Companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are currently in an AI war, for instance. Late last year, OpenAI launched its ChatGPT AI chatbot which has offered substantial utility to many users even if it makes mistakes. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) previously invested $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019 and the company agreed to invest another $10 billion in 2023.Furthermore, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is planning to incorporate ChatGPT into Bing to potentially gain market share from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google.In response, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google is planning on launching multiple AI products this year, including its own AI search tool, Bard. Although Bard also makes mistakes, both will improve over time as the technology advances.Story continuesGiven its leading market share in cloud computing, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) likely will help power the computer processing of many AI applications in the future. Companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have invested substantial amounts into AI technologies and will likely have new AI incorporated products and services of their own in the future as well.Some other leading companies that the financial media likes are leading consumer staple conglomerates such as The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) that have long histories of increasing their annual dividends through multiple recessions.While the set-it-and-forget-it leading companies in the market have compelling qualities in the long term, they still have downside if the economy worsens or if their results do not meet expectations. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.AmazonPhoto by Bryan Angelo on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 10 Set-It-and-Forget-It Stocks to Buy According to Financial Media, we selected the stocks that have been highly regarded by the financial media as stocks that could do well in the long term.For those of you interested, check out 15 Stocks That Have Increased Their Dividends for Over 25 Years.10 Set-It-and-Forget-It Stocks to Buy According to Financial Media10. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $125.73 billionAlthough it isn't one of the big four biggest American banks, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is Wall Street's most prestigious investment bank. As a result, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is viewed by many in the financial media as the leading bank to the world's rich and powerful. Being a leading bank to the rich and powerful can be a pretty good business to be in the long term even if Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) employees are very well paid. In the last ten years, the stock of the leading investment bank has more than doubled. As of February 10, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) also has a dividend yield of 2.69%.Alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a set-it-and-forget-it stock to buy according to financial media.9. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $285.44 billionBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is one of the 'big four' American banks with a market capitalization of $285.44 billion, ranking #9 on our list of 10 Set-It-and-Forget-It Stocks to Buy According to Financial Media. Given its scale and importance in the financial sector, many in the financial media view big banks like Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) as systematically important. Although being systemically important doesn't mean good returns, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) nevertheless does also have substantial normalized earnings power and management is returning capital back to shareholders with a dividend yield of 2.47% as of 2/10. On average, analysts expect the bank to earn $3.12 per share for 2022, $3.48 per share in 2023, $3.76 per share in 2024, and $4.23 per share in 2025.8. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $326.18 billionThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is viewed by many in the financial media as a Dividend Aristocrat or a stock that has raised its annual dividend for at least 25 straight years. In terms of its dividend, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has actually raised its annual dividend for 67 straight years, meaning the leading consumer staple has been financially strong enough to increase payouts through multiple recessions. Although higher inflation has been a headwind for demand for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) recently, the company has long term earnings power if inflation normalizes.7. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $413.70 billionJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is regarded by many in the financial media as one of America's best big banks given the company's strong profitability and arguably great CEO in Jamie Dimon. Like Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a systemically important institution, giving it more importance in the media. Although an economic slowdown or recession could decrease earnings in the near term, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has long term EPS growth potential given its earnings power and eventual stock buybacks which could begin as early as this year.6. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $423.94 billionJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is viewed by the financial media as another leading Dividend Aristocrat that has increased its annual dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. In Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s case, the healthcare conglomerate has actually increased its annual dividend 61 consecutive years. Although shares of the stock are down 5.45% in the last year, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) increased its full year 2022 sales by 1.3% year over year to $94.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 3.6% year over year to $10.15 per share. Shares currently trade for a forward P/E of 14.84, which could be attractive in terms of the long term if the conglomerate maintains its market share.Like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are set-it-and-forget-it stocks to buy according to financial media.

The fact that insiders chose to dispose of US$24m worth of stock in the past 12 months even though prices were relatively low could be indicative of some anticipated weakness.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger Schlumberger Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, Abdellah Merad, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.0m worth of shares at a price of US$57.20 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$56.36. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Insiders in Schlumberger didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Schlumberger Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Schlumberger. In total, insiders dumped US$17m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Does Schlumberger Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Schlumberger insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$175m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Schlumberger Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought Schlumberger stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But since Schlumberger is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To assist with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Schlumberger.But note: Schlumberger may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The big game is a billion dollar business. Major companies like T-Mobile (TMUS), Budweiser (BUD), General Motors (GM), Netflix (NFLX) and Uber (UBER) and set to spend millions of dollars to air a commercial during the broadcast. Betting will also take center stage, with over 50 million people expected to wager billions on sites like DraftKings (DKNG), MGM (MGM) and more. Food prices will also dominate the night; while chicken wings and avocados are cheaper this year, beer prices are on the rise.Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith, Dave Briggs, Josh Schafer and Alexandra Canal take a look at the finances behind the big game.Key Video Takeaways.05:00 - DraftKings CEO Jason Robins11:45 - Governor Katie Hobbs, (D) Arizona18:00 - Philadelphia Eagles Defensive Tackle Ndamukong Suh30:00 - Halftime show expectations42:00 - the big business of Super Bowl ads49:00 - How stocks perform based on the winning team55:00 - Rising food costsVideo TranscriptDAVID BRIGGS: Hey, everybody, Dave and Seana.

And, also, the number of people expected to bet on the Super Bowl-- 50 million Americans, one of the big prop bets, what's going to be the color of that Gatorade shower? What do you think?DAVID BRIGGS: I'm going red.SEANA SMITH: I'm going orange. I was going to go yellow. Reds a bold bet. I like it. We will see who the winner is.Story continues[MUSIC PLAYING]DAVID BRIGGS: Hey, everybody. Welcome into our Super Bowl LVII coverage. I'm Dave Briggs, alongside Seana Smith. Cannot wait for this game. We've got a lot coming your way over the next hour. I'm really excited for the game itself, but I want you to go first on what you're eyeing in the game, or outside the game.SEANA SMITH: Well, in the game-- I'm going to say an overall thing-- it's going to be the Eagles, my hometown team. I am very, very excited for them going for their second title in the last six years. Specific, Jalen Hurts, it's all about him. He's got to keep the momentum. I'm excited about that. Aside from the game, the halftime show. Apple is now going-- is the official sponsor of the show this year, taking over from Pepsi. Rihanna is back on the live music stage. I'm excited.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm just out of the loop on Rihanna. I'm sorry. I don't want to offend anybody. I just don't get it. But I know she's awesome. I'm excited because, look, I think the Eagles have a far superior roster. I do acknowledge that. But Andy Reid always has something interesting up his sleeve. Something you have never seen before, and Patrick Mahomes has that Harry-Potter-like wand. He has magic. I think they actually should be a 7 or an 8-point underdog. I think the Eagles are a much better team. But the Chiefs can really surprise you, but I'll be honest, what I'm really looking forward to is my only Super Bowl tradition, my wife's buffalo chicken dip. It's awesome. Like, that's all that matters for me on Super Bowl Sunday.SEANA SMITH: You're going to bring over the leftovers on Monday, then.DAVID BRIGGS: There won't be any, dude.SEANA SMITH: Well, maybe you should--DAVID BRIGGS: I'll be, like, scraping--SEANA SMITH: --leave a little bit--DAVID BRIGGS: --the bowl with my fingers when the chips run out.SEANA SMITH: I got to get the recipe after this show. All right, well, this might be the biggest Super Bowl yet for the gambling industry. Lots to look forward to this weekend. The American Gaming Association releasing its predictions for Super Bowl LVII, estimating that about 50 million Americans will bet roughly $16 billion on this year's game. That's more than double last year's total, but our own, Josh Schafer, has been looking further into this number, what it really means for the sportsbook operators. What do you got for us, Josh?JOSH SHAFER: That's right, Seana. So that's $16 billion number is, obviously, a massive number, but not all of that is going to go right to the sportsbook. So for starters, that number includes both bets placed legally and illegally. It's also an estimate. And if we take a look at last year's estimate, 7.61 billion translated to just $950 million of legal handle. That's according to the AGA's assessment of state data.So less than 15% of last year's estimation ended up as legal handle. Now, the total amount at legal books, and then if you have to think about how these sportsbooks make money, right? So you take that handle-- that legal handle, that $950 million and then you subtract what's known as the gross winning margin, or you multiply it by that gross winning margin, which is only 10% on average.Then when you multiply those, you end up only getting $95 million as the total legal handle-- or, sorry, the gross gaming revenue, which is what goes back to the sportsbooks. That's the number that ends up getting taxed, and that can be taxed, guys, at about an average of a 20% rate. So there are $95 million then taxed at 20%, it's just not quite as big as that $16 billion number we like to talk about all the time, but it is still a huge week, Dave. The stocks have been roaring headed into the Super Bowl. The three or four of the gambling stocks here over the last month, so it certainly is an exciting time.DAVID BRIGGS: You just took like an extra large pizza and boiled it down to one slice.JOSH SHAFER: But that slice could be delicious. That slice could be absolutely delicious.DAVID BRIGGS: And it's still a pretty solid slice. It's a New York-sized slice. But the game is not in New York. It's in Arizona. And that's the first time we've ever had a legal sports gambling state host a Super Bowl. What does that mean? What are the implications?JOSH SHAFER: Well, it means that people can bet well they're sitting in the stadium, right? And that's the biggest thing that we're going to be watching, and really what I want to point out here too is the tax rate. So Arizona taxes mobile betting at a 10% rate, and why I'm watching that number is because Arizona is probably going to have a higher handle this Sunday than they normally would. They're going to get a 10% rate on that. They're going to get a lot of state revenue, guys. And I'm curious how that leads moving forward. As we continue to see gambling grow, are more states going to want the Super Bowl to bring in a lot of gamblers, get people excited for the game and get more state revenue? Seems like a decent deal to me.DAVID BRIGGS: Where's the game next year? Vegas, baby. I mean--JOSH SHAFER: Not a bad place for gambling.DAVID BRIGGS: That seems like it'll work out well. Great stuff. 50. 50 million Americans expected to throw down $16 billion in bets on Super Bowl LVII. Let's dig into those numbers with DraftKings CEO, Jason Robins. Jason, good to see you, man. 33 states now legal. How big is this weekend for you guys compared to anything you've seen in the past? What are your expectations?JASON ROBINS: Oh, I mean, given the growth of the industry, this is almost certainly going to be our biggest Super Bowl ever. And hard to know, it's always-- we always have predictions around the office going in because it's such a fun time. But one thing we know is it's going to be a big day. We know it's going to be our biggest customer acquisition day, and we're all excited to see the results. By the way, I heard in the other set, you're betting on red for the Gatorade? Is that-- I hear that right?DAVID BRIGGS: Do I have the wrong color, bro?JASON ROBINS: Listen, I don't know, but somebody told me, and you should verify this because I did not verify myself that there has never been red Gatorade poured on the winning coach in the Super Bowl. So maybe this is the year, but just a little hot take for you to check out. And I could be totally wrong on that. It was something somebody told me, but you should check that out.DAVID BRIGGS: Betting scoop. I appreciate that, buddy. That is solid. I had my eye on like an Eagles Green, so I'm going to have to look at the odds here on DraftKings.SEANA SMITH: Jeez, I think I picked orange. Hopefully, my odds are a little bit better than what Dave is facing right now, but, Jason, you talk about the popularity of sports betting, certainly we have seen massive growth over the last several years. With the Super Bowl in Arizona, like we're talking about, the first state with statewide legalized sports gambling here, in terms of the number of users that you are expected to add, can you put a number on that?JASON ROBINS: We can. I mean, one, we actually have earnings next week. So I've got to be careful about saying anything like that, but, also, it's just tough to predict. I mean, so much comes in towards the end and the last day, and even in the last hours. And so hard to say, but I know that we think it'll be our biggest day ever, and that's been the case for the last three Superbowls, or last-- excuse me, four Super Bowls since legalized sports betting as well.JOSH SHAFER: Jason, I'm curious what you're seeing out of the live betting space. Obviously, I think it being in Arizona probably helps, right? With people being excited while they're at the game, to probably bet during the game while they're sitting in the stands. I know often we talk about that Europe number, right? Maybe getting to 70, 75% of all bets, or all handle being in that live betting space. Do you think we eventually get there? Or is that where things are headed? How have you sort of seen those trends?JASON ROBINS: You know, live betting continues to increase. I think whether we get there or higher or a little lower, I don't know. But I think it's going to continue to grow. I think more and more people are starting to see that you can make bets during the game. And that doesn't just mean things like what's the next play or something like that.Some people decide, hey, maybe at halftime, they want to double down on the bet they made before the game. Or maybe they want to switch sides or something like that. So lots of options throughout the game.We also, you mentioned Arizona. This is the first year since legalized sports betting outside of Nevada that you will have a Super Bowl in a state with legal sports betting. So really excited to see how that plays out. I agree with you. I think it's going to have a tremendous halo effect on the state.Because not only the people at the game, but all the people that are in Arizona that know that the Super Bowl is here and are paying attention. And we're doing everything we can to let all the people coming in from out of town know, hey, while you're here, you can make a bet. And I think you're going to see a lot of fans take us up on that.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, that is interesting. And next year it'll be the second in a row because it's in Vegas.JASON ROBINS: Yeah.DAVID BRIGGS: But in terms of the big picture, certainly all the momentum is on the side of the sports gambling. But those three big states are out there-- California, Texas, and Florida. What went wrong in California? And when do you see any of those three states turning legal?JASON ROBINS: Well, I mean, California, it's pretty simple. We had over $200 million in opposition spent against us. I think, you know, eight times maybe is close to that, the next biggest opposition spend of any campaign. So, you know, we were literally attacked with a barrage of ads, many of them pushing false narratives. But not much you can do in a short cycle. And people hear what they hear. And, unfortunately, I think some incorrect facts got out there.So, you know, I think, first, we're going to try to work with the tribes. Obviously, that's a much easier path than trying to fight them. And nobody wants that. We actually had in our ballot initiative revenue going to the tribes. We had tethering to the tribes. Everything had to flow through the tribes.And, you know, we're going to hopefully get another year, another, I guess, two years from now. Well, one year from now, we're going to be able to potentially take another shot. And I think we have to learn from last time and educate a little better and be smarter about it. So we'll see on that.One Texas is in play this year. I think there's a live bill that has a decent shot of advancing. We'll have to see. Obviously, a lot to play out in the legislative session. So, you know, I think those are the two biggest states.Florida, you mentioned also, you know, tribal state, so has some of the same dynamics. But in that case, it's really one tribe, the Seminoles. So, you know, trying to figure out a way to collaborate with them, I think.And, hopefully, that's where the industry is going. There's just more collaboration. And everybody realizes that a rising tide will lift all ships. And, you know, I think that's something that we're seeing slowly but surely to try and move towards. But still a lot of work to do there, and especially in those big states. They're big prizes. So there's obviously going to be a lot of interest and a lot of stakeholders.SEANA SMITH: All right, Jason Robins, CEO of DraftKings, always great to have you. Thanks so much. Have fun this weekend.JASON ROBINS: OK, thank you so much.SEANA SMITH: All right, well, Arizona, like we've been talking about, is hosting this year's Super Bowl. Hundreds of thousands of fans are already there, getting ready for the big game. Yahoo Finance contributor Kevin Cirilli is doing just that. And Kevin, I know you spoke with a lot of key voices down there. I've got to say, I'm very jealous. I wish I was in your shoes right now. Give us a lay of the land. What's it like down there in Arizona right now?KEVIN CIRILLI: Well, when the plane landed at Sky Harbor, I thought I was in Ireland. Because all I kept seeing was green. There are literally-- I mean, there's-- I've seen like maybe one or two Chiefs fans. But, I mean, it's all Eagles fans everywhere. So, I mean, I feel like I'm at home here in sunny Scottsdale. Camelback Mountain behind me, if you know the area.Look, I was at the Phoenix Open, the Waste Management Open earlier this week, which has really become a business private partnership, a public private partnership, really a hub that Jack Selby, who's the managing director for Peter Thiel's family, and he's got his own venture capitalist investing $110 million here in the state. He started this thing. And it's really gone global.And one of the folks he was able to get out there was governor Katie Hobbs, the newly-elected Democratic governor of Arizona. And she noted the economic impact that the Super Bowl, that the Phoenix Open that that's having on this state. Take a listen to what she told me on the 17th hole.KATIE HOBBS: It is huge. It is huge. We have 160,000 workers in our tourism and hospitality industry that are ready to welcome the visitors that are already here, making sure they have a great experience. That gets return visits. And that helps our economy. The last time we had the Super Bowl in 2015, the economic impact was over $700 million.- $700 million?KATIE HOBBS: Yeah, yeah With over 100,000 visitors. So we're expecting to top that. And the lasting benefits for our economy, because we've become sort of-- we have a great track record with these kind of big events. And it's just going to attract more of them in the future.KEVIN CIRILLI: So when you look at the numbers, last year alone, $24.2 billion worth in the sports and tourism industry contributed to Arizona's GDP. They're expecting that the Super Bowl alone will increase that number to more than $1,000,000,000. So you could see a five percentage increase in that regard.But a lot of economic development here outside of sports. The semiconductor chip manufacturing that's being conducted here in the state, something that President Biden talked about in his State of the Union address earlier this week. Remember, Intel, TSMC building their fab factories down here.The governor is excited about that. Jack Selby is excited about that. A lot happening. They're trying to give Austin a run for their money.DAVID BRIGGS: All right, quickly, I know you're a big fan. I know you think Philly is going to win. Give me a score. And what's the particular edge you think that Philly has over KC?KEVIN CIRILLI: All right, well, one, the fans. That's the edge, clearly. Two, they're going to essentially be playing in a home stadium. And, three, I'm thinking it'll be 27-24, Birds. I do think it's going to be a nail-biter. I heard you compare-- I heard you compare the Chiefs to Hogwarts. And I got to say, that is not the case, OK? Like the Eagles are Gryffindor, let me just put it that way. How's that?DAVID BRIGGS: First off, it was Patrick Mahomes is Harry Potter, has a bit of wizardry to him. Let's get it straight, Cirilli, all right?KEVIN CIRILLI: OK.DAVID BRIGGS: Good luck, brother. Enjoy it out there, OK?KEVIN CIRILLI: I appreciate it. That's awesome, awesome. I'll talk to you guys later. Thank you for having me.DAVID BRIGGS: All right, we're going to be taking a look now at some prop bets through the hour. Our Josh Schafer, he is our resident junky gambler. And he's going to break it down for us. I need some prop action. So what do you got?JOSH SCHAFER: We've got some fun ones here for you guys. We're going to start with Gatorade, which sounds like it's a hot topic for you two. And--DAVID BRIGGS: Yep.SEANA SMITH: Yes.JOSH SCHAFER: --I'm not going to lie, where did we pick? Who had red? Someone had red, right?DAVID BRIGGS: I took red.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, all right, you're with 8% of the handle here. That's plus 450 odds, Dave. So what you're looking at is where people are betting. So the most bet on Gatorade is yellow. 40% of the money is on yellow. And then you've got 20% of the money on blue, 20% of the money on orange.SEANA SMITH: That's my pick.JOSH SCHAFER: My pick-- I've got to step out of the way here-- is purple. Because I think Riptide Rush is the best Gatorade. And that's simply all I'm picking off of. There is some fun stats, if you guys want to go deep into this, right? Orange is the most picked. That's probably why Seana picked it. It's come up the most times since 2001.SEANA SMITH: I did my research.JOSH SCHAFER: And then yellow is also very popular right now among Eagles fans. So yellow was poured on Doug Pederson at the NFC Championship and the Super Bowl the last time the Eagles won. And Nick Sirianni two weeks ago had yellow Gatorade poured on him.DAVID BRIGGS: Oh.SEANA SMITH: I love that flavor.JOSH SCHAFER: We like yellow.DAVID BRIGGS: That's a solid scoop. There are some of these colors, Josh, that are a little bit in between, that there's like a greenish-blue. You know what I mean, that greenish-blue Gatorade.JOSH SCHAFER: Green-blue, well, we've got yellow-green.DAVID BRIGGS: Right, I'm looking at it--JOSH SCHAFER: We're going to have to call back up Jason Robins--SEANA SMITH: You're the one that's disputing the color of Gatorade.JOSH SCHAFER: --and dispute what color you had. Because yellow-green is the only unclear one here. Then you've got red-pink.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, that would be pretty clear.DAVID BRIGGS: But like, pink?SEANA SMITH: That's going to be a tough one to argue with.DAVID BRIGGS: Is that even a Gatorade?JOSH SCHAFER: That's why I'm going with purple. It's simple.DAVID BRIGGS: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: I don't know if it's ever happened.SEANA SMITH: I'm going orange.JOSH SCHAFER: But I'm going purple.DAVID BRIGGS: OK, all right, that's a good job.JOSH SCHAFER: All right, coming up, Eagles defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh who competes for his second Super Bowl ring on Sunday also boasts an impressive investing portfolio. He'll tell us more about it next.[MUSIC PLAYING]No shortage of storylines ahead of Super Bowl LVII. We've got the first ever meeting of Black quarterbacks, the first ever meeting between two brothers in Jason and Travis Kelce, and the third Super Bowl with three different teams from one of the greatest defensive linemen in NFL history. I'm talking about Eagles five time all-pro defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, who joins us now.Great of you to find the time during this busy week, my friend. So three teams, three Super Bowls. What makes this experience different for you?NDAMUKONG SUH: The experience each and every single year is different. No matter what team you're with, whether you've been with the team for 10 years or two years, every year is different. Every team is different and always going to continue to be that way, unfortunately. But that's part of the business. But it's exciting to have an opportunity to get back to the Super Bowl and have another opportunity to win.SEANA SMITH: Ndamukong, it's great to see. You're playing for my hometown team. So I am clearly rooting for you on Sunday. You're playing this time for Nick Sirianni. Who's not that much older than you. From your time with the Eagles this year, what have you learned from him just in terms of the leadership and his success that he's clearly having so early in his career?NDAMUKONG SUH: He's a great coach. Having played against him last year in the playoffs when I was down in Tampa and we took care of business that first round, but he's a great coach. He understands all the different nuances, has an opportunity to be a leader on the offensive side of the ball, but also understand the defense and how we want to particularly rush up front and get off the quarterbacks. And I think from the standpoint of his leadership, he just understands, it's all about keeping detail-oriented process, focusing on the things that count the most when it comes to situational ball and going from there.DAVID BRIGGS: I mentioned that quarterback match-up, which is so intriguing. Tell me about the key to defending, to stopping, to containing Patrick Mahomes. And if I could ask a double, you shut down your quarterback, Jalen Hurts, this time last year a bit earlier. How much has he grown in that one year?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, we'll start first with Patrick Mahomes. He's a great talent, very, very elusive, to say the least. I've been going against him in years past, but most notably in the 2021 Super Bowl that I won with Tampa. He's just always extending the play. And that's something that as a defensive line that we have to focus on.There's no end in rushing. Until that ball either incomplete or you got a sack and he's fully, fully down, you've got to keep rushing. Because he loves to extend plays and make things happen and getting balls to the receivers, especially 87.And so when it comes to transitioning to Jalen, I think Jalen has grown tremendously. He's found a way to not only hurt people with his feet, but as well as his arm. And I think the GM Howard did an amazing job defining great talent around him and adding some pieces, for example, AJ Brown.DAVID BRIGGS: Boy, has he come a long way in just one year. Speaking of, you've come a long way over your career. You were once voted the dirtiest player in the league. You've been fined more than $600,000. But, recently, you played peacekeeper against the Niners. How do you think you have evolved over these 13 years? Or were you just misunderstood?NDAMUKONG SUH: I've always said it, if people ever take the time to really get to understand me and get to know me and really truthfully be unbiased when it comes to my personality and my character, they wouldn't have made those votes and they wouldn't have had that particular characteristics around me as a person. I've always been some sort of a peacekeeper or, if you want to call it that. But I know Trent well. So when he saw me getting in front of him and it wasn't about anything other than the game is pretty much over, let's move on, let's get to the next play and go from there.SEANA SMITH: You've clearly had a lot of success on the field. You've also had a lot of success off the field as well. I know you have invested in over 30 companies. One of your mentors is actually Warren Buffett. Talk to us just about that relationship, the biggest lessons that you've learned from him, and how that's really helped shape your investment career.NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think the biggest thing that I've learned from Mr. Buffett is just being able to have good people around you. And as you see, he has multiple companies. He trusts those folks and puts them in places and empowers them.And that's something that I like to do, not only in my foundation with my family and my wife, but also being to be able to empower people, whether it's in the real estate realm, having a development company, being able to build multifamily housing, being able to take care of other people and finding ways to find affordable housing for folks that should be afforded to them at all times. And it's tough in this day and age, especially going through the pandemic. You saw that it's probably its worst. And so hopefully we can continue as a collective to get better in that space. But when it comes to investing, I just have fun with it.I love learning. I love being able to sit down with folks. I actually sat down with one of our owners yesterday to have a great conversation of how he built his company with KKR. I've done some work with them. And so it's a fun opportunity for me to just be able to build relationships and learn from folks and then being able to be involved and be hands-on.SEANA SMITH: You mentioned your involvement in real estate there a moment ago, some of your initiatives, how you're looking to tackle housing affordability. From your perspective from your involvement in the space over the last several years, what more do you think needs to be done? And how do we better address this issue?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think it's-- I think one of the key things that we could do, especially when it comes to affordable housing, is kind of take it out of the city and state's hands. If we privatize it in a manner and incentivize private real estate people, it'd be great. Because if you really look at it and break down the numbers from a perspective how I look at it, it's one of the most expensive housing just because of the rules and regulations that go into it, which I understand and respect. But if we potentially looked at it being privatized, I think would be a lot faster and to be able to be something that is afforded to people a lot quicker.SEANA SMITH: You're involved in over 30 companies here. I think a lot of people at home are asking, how do you have the time for this? How involved are you with each investment?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think I'm very, very involved in every single day, finding time to be able to do it. But it's really being able to compartmentalize things. Obviously, playing football pulls me away from it a fair amount. But I've been at it for 13 years. I understand how I need to study, how I need to focus, even going into a very important week like this week with the Super Bowl, I can still look at things. I probably won't as detailed and push it off just a week or two.But, for me, I still look at opportunities and find time to do it. And I think one of the greatest things that helps you keep you sharp. Because if you get overloaded in one particular thing, then you don't have the capacity to go and look at other things and find ways to keep your mind sharp when it comes to, one, playing football and knowing what you need to accomplish.DAVID BRIGGS: That is a super sharp man and a likely future Hall of Famer Ndamukong Suh. Well, if you don't have a ticket to the Super Bowl, you're not too late. And the trends are, in fact, going in your favor. So maybe be patient. You will, though, have to shell out a ton of cash to go to this game.We're taking a look at the prices all through this week. The cheapest tickets selling for $4,300. That was Monday, according to StubHub. But that number gradually declining through the week, the opposite trend that we usually see-- dropping $200 Tuesday, a huge drop of $500 on Wednesday. And we're finishing out the week with the cheapest ticket costing $3,100. Still a ton of cheddar, but it's come down considerably from the beginning of the week.All that data is for the cheapest ticket to the game. That's in the nosebleeds. If you want the good seats, if you want to bring a friend that you're trying to impress, you've got to really shell out. And here's the cost.You can sit in section 138M, row 44, main end zone. Tickets are a cool $87,000 each. So you and a friend will pay over $174,000 to see the game. You better-- well, we won't go on.Some other trends we're watching, Eagles fans are outselling Chiefs fans by more than double, according to StubHub. That fits what we're hearing from Kevin Cirilli on the ground in Arizona. The ticket vendor seeing a last-minute sales spike in Mexico, the top, number two top selling country outside of the US, behind Canada. And most US buyers are coming from these five states-- no surprise, Pennsylvania, California, New Jersey, Arizona, and Florida. Chiefs fans in Missouri and Kansas accounting for a combined 8% of sales. What's going on, Chiefs fans? You've got a couple of days to try to change that dynamic.Coming up, Apple will be in the spotlight at Super Bowl LVII. Find out what a big Sunday could mean for that company. And we asked you if Rihanna will bring out any surprise guests during the Apple-sponsored Super Bowl halftime show. Roughly 60% of you said ""yes."" We will discuss coming up who that might be. Some of you made predictions. We've got A$AP Rocky, Miley Cyrus, JAY-Z, even Beyoncé as a possible guest. More on what else to expect coming up next.[MUSIC PLAYING]SEANA SMITH: A huge part of the Super Bowl is the halftime show, with many people tuning into the game just for that big performance. This year, Apple is the official sponsor and Rihanna is taking the stage with her first live performance in years. I know I'm very excited for the game. Allie Canal is very excited for the game. She's on the set. Now you don't have to look any further than that jersey that she's wearing for who she's rooting for this weekend.ALLIE CANAL: Go Birds. Go Birds.DAVID BRIGGS: She's chair dancing, man.SEANA SMITH: She's chair dancing.ALLIE CANAL: I'm, like, in such a great mood. I'm so excited.SEANA SMITH: There we go. We're ready.ALLIE CANAL: Right.JOSH SCHAFER: You might have to hide on Monday. I don't know.SEANA SMITH: Lots of hype here. All right, Al, let's talk about the halftime show, right? Because lots of money going into it, lots of hype ahead of this show. What can we expect? And how expensive is it for these musicians?ALLIE CANAL: Well, the NFL, you know, famously doesn't pay the halftime performers. But it does pay for all the upfront costs. So think about the stages, the background dancers, the lighting. That's all the NFL. And that could amount to a pretty hefty price tag, around $17 million.That was a reported cost for last year's show. You know RiRi. She's going to want the production value. It could be even more for that. And for Rihanna, she was asked to do the halftime show back in 2019. She said no in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick.Now she's back. She said she's ready for this moment. She's apparently changed her setlist 39 times. So I am ready for this. And it's going to be very big for her in terms of her streams on those music platforms like Spotify, like Apple Music.If you take a look at the past, last year's performance, which featured Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem, and 50 Cent, each and every one of those performers saw a boost to their personal catalogs. Dr. Dre saw 183% increase in album sales, a 105% bump in on-demand streams. Mary J. Blige, her album sales jumped almost 1,000%, with Snoop Dogg's rising 361%.And then if you take a look at the five years prior, we have The Weeknd, J.Lo, Shakira, Maroon 5, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, all an uptick in digital downloads, album sales, Spotify streams. So the exposure here is unbelievable. And that's really why it's worth it for a lot of these artists. And we've seen an uptick in the amount of viewers that are actually tuning in and watching this halftime show. Last year, for example, viewership was up 7% compared to 2021 with more than 130 million people tuning in. So we'll have to see if Rihanna can get those numbers up even higher, which I think she can.DAVID BRIGGS: Do you really?ALLIE CANAL: I do. People are excited about this.DAVID BRIGGS: I know, I know. I'm excited. Don't get me wrong. A lot of people want to know, opening song and special guest. We've seen a lot of that in recent years. What do you got?ALLIE CANAL: Opening song, I've got ""Run This Town."" That just feels to me like an opening song. Special guest, I think it has to be JAY-Z. JAY-Z's Roc Nation is a producer of the halftime show. Rihanna is also signed to the Roc Nation label. So I feel like he's going to help out his girl. He's featured on a lot of her songs. So that's my prediction. That's where I'm going with it.DAVID BRIGGS: We're going to go around the horn real quick. I'm going to go totally outside the box. I think she is unconventional. I don't think she's going to do anybody predictable. It's going to be a country star. It's going to be like Zach Bryan--SEANA SMITH: That would be a curveball.DAVID BRIGGS: --or Zac Brown Band.JOSH SHAFER: Chris Stapleton stays after the National Anthem?DAVID BRIGGS: Oh, that'd be amazing, my favorite singer of all time. But I think someone-- Sugarland, someone like that. Unconventional, brings in a different portion of the audience.SEANA SMITH: I've got to agree with Allie. I was going to go JAY-Z before we even heard her pick. I think that makes the most sense. We know he has shown a little bit of resistance against the Super Bowl halftime show in the past. I would not be surprised if we see him on that stage on Sunday.JOSH SCHAFER: They always make fun of on the sports shows when everyone picks the same team, right, and we all have the same little icon on the bottom. Because I'm going to pick JAY-Z too.SEANA SMITH: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: So that's when they normally say that's not going to happen. But I don't know. It's my favorite song. ""Run This Town"" is my favorite song. JAY-Z is, obviously, very involved, as Allie said. So that was my pick before everyone else picked. So we've got to stay with it.SEANA SMITH: All right, I like ""Umbrella.""DAVID BRIGGS: Wow.ALLIE CANAL: She's predicting ""Umbrella.""SEANA SMITH: ""Ella-ella-ella.""ALLIE CANAL: ""Umbrella"" as a finale-- I could see a bunch of umbrellas out there.SEANA SMITH: Yes, exactly. It could be a good one. We'll see.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, I like that.SEANA SMITH: Clearly, we are very excited for the halftime show. David, you've got to jump on board here, you know?DAVID BRIGGS: I am, man.SEANA SMITH: We're going to get you to become a Rihanna fan.ALLIE CANAL: He's such a boomer. Dave is a boomer.SEANA SMITH: Sooner rather than later.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm gonna be honest, that's when I get my Buffalo chicken dip, man, whatever.SEANA SMITH: All right.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm here for the game.ALLIE CANAL: OK, boomer.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, thanks so much. Well, Apple, like we've been talking about, replacing Pepsi as the official sponsor for this year's Super Bowl halftime show. $250 million deal spans five years. This is according to the ""Sports Business Journal."" Let's discuss what this means for the tech giant.For that, we want to bring back Dan Ives, Wedbush managing director, its senior equity analyst. Dan, it's great to see you here. So, clearly, a huge move for Apple, now being the sponsor of the halftime show. How big of a win do you think it is for the company?Dan, I think you're muted. And we love the Eagles jersey, by the way. Got it?DAN IVES: OK, so part of what Cook and Cupertino are focused on is really on the NFL and live sports. And this is an important part of, ultimately, what we see Apple doing more and more of over the coming years. I think it's a huge win. And especially in this macro period, Apple doing this further flexes the muscles.SEANA SMITH: Dan, when you talked about Apple here going forward, I think lots of questions just about the amount of money that they have spent or are going to spend on the halftime shows over the next several years. When you see that, does that make sense for them, given the fact that there's no guaranteed return on this type of investment?DAN IVES: But Apple, they're tacticians in terms of how they spend. And this is something they don't just do quickly. And if you look at the history, I mean, they have basically made big bets that have been home successes. And I also I think at this juncture, it's very important that they're investing at a time where some others maybe be are pulling back. And I think that's an important time, especially going into more iPhone launches as well as some other technologies I'd expect them to introduce over the coming months.DAVID BRIGGS: You thought they were going to take a big swing at the Sunday NFL Ticket package. What happened there? Did they end up making a bid? Did it just get out of the range they wanted to spend? And do you think they'll take another pass at an NBA, NFL type of property?DAN IVES: Yeah, and, look, I think there was significant involvement. I think some reports have talked about it. I just think it got to a point where they're only going to spend a certain amount. Ultimately, they were not going to go to that level.But live sports is the key to streaming. I mean, that is one of the keys for Apple when it comes to the streaming piece. I don't think they're stopping here. I think they're going to go after major sports over the coming years. When you look at that content strategy, I mean, it just further highlights whether it's streaming in terms of on TV or what we see with Apple Music, services, under the radar, has actually morphed into a pretty massive business.DAVID BRIGGS: How much will live sports mean for this tech battle? We just discussed Apple. You've got Google who made the big play for Sunday NFL Ticket, $2 and 1/2 billion a year, rumored to be per year, and then Amazon, of course, already in with Thursday Night Football. Or is it not that important in terms of the overall growth investor story?DAN IVES: I think it's a golden jewel, I mean, in terms of what big tech is focused on with streaming. Live sports is what is ultimately-- and that's why the value continues to go up. Because that's just traditional media. I think big tech is going to take significant bets on live sports over the coming year, especially as you look into '23, '24, '25, '26, a lot sort of come up for renewal. And I think streaming is going to be a big part of that over the coming years.SEANA SMITH: Dan, we don't have to ask you who you're rooting for, very clear. Got to ask you about the score. What do you think it's going to be on Sunday?DAN IVES: I see Eagles by 10.SEANA SMITH: OK.DAN IVES: I think, ultimately, yeah, I think between Hurts and that defense, I see a lot of happy fans in the 215 area code.SEANA SMITH: I hope you are right. 215 area code is my hometown. Dan Ives, great to see you. Thanks so much.DAN IVES: Thank you.SEANA SMITH: All right, Josh has another bet that he's watching over there. What do you got now, Josh?JOSH SCHAFER: All right, guys, we've got the coin toss now. You can bet on a 50/50 coin toss. I know, how exciting, right? But people will do it.And we asked our viewers what they picked. And they like heads. We had 55% or just about 55% of people say that they would vote heads or bet heads. But then when you look actually at where the money is right now at a place like Caesars Sportsbook, the money's on tails.58% of people betting on tails. You can see the odds right there, -102 and -102. Of course, even odds because, again, it's a 50/50 bet. Now, if you want to go fun stats, four out of the last five Super Bowls were heads.DAVID BRIGGS: That is nice research.SEANA SMITH: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: So I don't know if that makes you think your tails is due or--SEANA SMITH: What would you bet, Josh?JOSH SCHAFER: I would go heads.SEANA SMITH: You would go heads?JOSH SCHAFER: Yes, in a former life, I did the coin toss all the time. I always went heads. You've got to play the same one every time. I think you have to do a strategy on a 50/50.SEANA SMITH: Stick with it.DAVID BRIGGS: Real quickly, I want your pick with the spread. It's Philly by 1 and 1/2. Who do you got?JOSH SCHAFER: Dave, I have a lot of bets set up. Why don't we talk about that in about 10 minutes?DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, all right. Nice tease.JOSH SCHAFER: Coming up next, the Super Bowl ad landscape is getting a makeover. Find out why sports betting platforms like FanDuel could be a winning bet on Sunday.[MUSIC PLAYING]- It's called the kick of destiny.- What the heck is kick of destiny?- Good luck. See you in Phoenix. Don't miss.- Oh, boy.DAVID BRIGGS: Oh, it's going to be live, 45 yard field goal for Gronk FanDuel's Kick of Destiny campaign starring Rob Gronkowski, getting plenty of buzz ahead of the big game. Who else is getting bang for their 7 million bucks? John Connors is the co-founder and CEO of marketing and communications agency Boathouse. He joins us now. John, good to see you, man.So last year was labeled the Crypto Bowl. How significant a presence is gambling making? Did they replace crypto?JOHN CONNORS: Yeah, I think to your point, this year is going to be the-- you know, the booze, chips, and gambling bowl all combined. And I love the fact that you led with Gronk.SEANA SMITH: Well, speaking of it being the booze, chips, and gambling bowl, let's talk about the gambling aspect of it with the booze. Because Molson Coors is back in the Super Bowl after more than 30 years. They're teaming up with DraftKings. And what's interesting about this initiative is that they're allowing users to bet on who they think, for example, what beer is going to appear first, what dog is going to be used in the commercial. From your perspective, just the engagement aspect of this, how smart is that? And what do you think we'll hear from other alcohol brands this Sunday?JOHN CONNORS: Yeah, I mean, I think, to your point, you can't separate gambling from the Super Bowl, right? And so the ability to make that brand connection and to get that engagement, these days, everyone's trying to figure out how they can drive up that engagement value, how they can drive up that social value, how they can drive up the conversation. And so I think FanDuel and DraftKings have done masterful jobs, sort of between the Gronk bet and the betting on Coors Miller and all the other pieces of driving up as much conversation as possible.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, the live element of the FanDuel ad, have we ever seen anything like that? And how big do you think that will pay off?JOHN CONNORS: I think we've seen things like that, but not in the Super Bowl, right? So I think at this level, I mean, I think you've seen a lot of categories try and launch a lot of new ideas all the way back to Apple in 1984. It's always a massive platform for new launches. And I think as those two exchange blows to sort of capture attention, capture volume, I think it's a masterful play.SEANA SMITH: Well, John, for the big ads, they're pricing out just around $7 million for 30 seconds. We're seeing many companies team up. Like we've been talking about one GM and Netflix in this ad starring Will Ferrell.WILL FERRELL: General Motors is going electric. And Netflix is joining by including more EVs in their movies and shows. The least they can do. So, if you're going to get swarmed by an army of the dead, why not get swarmed in an EV? Ew. I said no biting.- Oh.WILL FERRELL: Or if you're being voluntarily kidnapped, why not be kidnapped in an EV? What's that scent? Is it pine?SEANA SMITH: So GM teaming up with Netflix, trying to push their EVs to make them more mainstream. What do you think of this strategy, a big streamer teaming up with an automaker?JOHN CONNORS: I think you're seeing-- well, last year's automakers were an interesting strategy. It was majority of electric vehicles when none of them had the electric vehicles yet. So they were all teasing sort of what was coming down the road. I think you're seeing that collaboration piece across the Super Bowl this year. I think, you know, the marketers like to follow the artists. And the artists have been doing collabs for a long time.And I think we're just seeing a significant number. As you know as well, there's a little more safety in a collaboration. Sort of two teams, two big brands like Netflix and GM going at it together just drives it a little bit more safety for that chief marketing officer.SEANA SMITH: All right, John Connors, thanks so much for joining us. I know a lot of us are very excited for all the ads that we will be seeing in just two days from now.JOHN CONNORS: Go Eagles.SEANA SMITH: Well, coming up, the Super Bowl Indicator. We'll tell you how stocks may perform next week based on the big game's outcome. Stay with us.[MUSIC PLAYING]JOSH SCHAFER: Welcome back to our Super Bowl special here on Yahoo Finance. Normally, we talk plenty about market indicators on this show, like a 100-day moving average or how stocks perform in election years. But some say even sports can tell us where Mr. Market is headed over the next year. Ryan Detrick over at Carson Research recently released the latest data for what's known as the Super Bowl Indicator, which tells us how markets perform depending on the outcome of the big game.So let's keep it simple to start. Markets have historically performed better after a team from the NFC conference wins than if the AFC wins. You can see here that's 10% for the NFC, an average return 6.9% for the AFC. So, really, people should be rooting for this indicator for the Eagles, who are in the NFC. That would give us a better return per the data.Now that was a historical chart, of course, going all the way back and counting all outcomes. But both these teams have also won Super Bowls in the past. So the Eagles have won one Super Bowl just a couple of years ago. And the S&amp;P 500 fell 6.2% that year.The Chiefs have won two Super Bowls. When you average those together, that's up 8.1%. So not a lot to take there, only three games. I don't think that's my favorite one. Let's get to my favorite one.Market bulls should really be rooting for a blowout on Sunday. So if you take a look here, the average return of the S&amp;P 500 is 8.5%. Now, when there's a single-digit win in the Super Bowl, it goes up 4.9% on average. When there's a double-digit win in the Super Bowl, it goes up 10.9% on average. But when there's a blowout and someone wins by 21 points or more, there's a blowout in the markets too. And the S&amp;P 500 rises on average 13.6% that year.So I don't know about you guys, I might root for an Eagles blowout on Sunday.SEANA SMITH: Heck yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Maybe my 401(k) can recover from last year a little bit.DAVID BRIGGS: Philly fan here is going to root for that. That will not happen. They could have a comfortable win, but not a blowout win.JOSH SCHAFER: Well, keep that thought.DAVID BRIGGS: Where is the public money at?JOSH SCHAFER: The public money? Let's take a look at the public money, Dave. So we know the spread is 1 and 1/2, right, coming into this game. So the Eagles are favored by 1 and 1/2. And the public money right now is on the Eagles.So 69% of the handle on DraftKings Sportsbook is currently on the Eagles to cover that 1 and 1/2 point spread. So that means they'd have to win by 2. And then where I really want to bet on Sunday, I think, because I love the totals, is 51. So 51 is the total. And that's where people are betting right now.Here's my favorite bet, though. Travis Kelce, first touchdown. I bet it earlier in the playoffs. It hit. I love the first touchdown bets. It's really exciting to watch the first couple drives and see it. Plus 700, I'm all over it, Dave.Seana, what are you watching on Sunday? Give us a bet. You've got to give us a pick.SEANA SMITH: All right, well, I went in with a parlay. And I stole this from Ross Tucker, full disclosure. But I've got to give credit where credit's due. And I liked it. I liked it a lot.So let's talk about it. I think Jalen Hurts is going to score a touchdown. I think Haason Reddick is also going to get a sack. And I also think that the Eagles are going to win. And I'm confident in it.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, Tucker's a pretty good gambler. He's no dummy. I've got a dumb bet. Because these are dumb bets when you have multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple things that have to happen. Patrick Mahomes over 1 and 1/2 touchdowns, Travis Kelce over 50 yards, AJ Brown over 50 yards, DeVonta Smith-- receiver for the Eagles-- under 63 and 1/2 yards, and Jalen Hurts over 40 yards rushing. Full disclosure, I also stole mine from a 15-year-old who lives in my house. But he's pretty good at this.JOSH SCHAFER: It seems like we bet a lot on the ankle injuries there and the lower extremities. How healthy is Jalen Hurts? How healthy is Patrick Mahomes? To talk football a little bit, I'm nervous about some of those prop bets. I've heard some--DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, you don't like it? You don't like it?JOSH SCHAFER: I don't know.DAVID BRIGGS: Well, look, the thing-- now, I say a dumb bet because those have such tremendous odds that they lure in a lot of people because they pay off well. But no one ever wins them.JOSH SCHAFER: They have the highest hold rate for sportsbooks. Sportsbooks want you to bet those same game parlays because they make the most money off of them. But coming up, we're talking about inflation. It's crashing your Super Bowl party. Find out how much you'll need to shell out for food and drinks when we come back.[MUSIC PLAYING]SEANA SMITH: What good is watching football if you don't have a bevy of snacks and also drinks to enjoy during the big game? But this year, you've got to keep a very close eye on that price tag. Because when it comes to checkout, some fan favorites are much pricier than they've been in years past. Allie Canal joining us now with a closer look at what we will be paying this weekend. Allie, what do you got?ALLIE CANAL: Wow, the good news is, Seana, if you want some chicken wings-- which we have on our set now-- that's actually cheaper, 22% cheaper compared to this time last year, $2.65 versus $3.38 per pound the week of Super Bowl 2022. And that's due to a larger supply of wings, decreased freight costs, all of that driving prices lower. And if you want to get a little bit fancier than wings, we have sirloin steak prices. That's also down by about $1 per pound. I feel like you really are a steak guy, Philly cheesesteak maybe?DAVID BRIGGS: Not during the Super Bowl.SEANA SMITH: Philly cheesesteak--ALLIE CANAL: Philly cheesesteak, though-- I think that could be an option.JOSH SCHAFER: You can't have a steak during the Super Bowl.ALLIE CANAL: I know, so you probably want to stick with the wings. Plus, 22% versus, you know, versus the $1 less, I think you go with the wings here. But chips and guac, avocados, they're also down, which is nice. But something that's up is your beer, 11% higher.SEANA SMITH: Wow.DAVID BRIGGS: And they've seen demand slip because of that towards the end of the year, yeah.ALLIE CANAL: And I think it's interesting too that soft drinks as well, they're up 25% So it's actually cheaper to get a little buzz going than just stay sober during the game. But we were talking about--SEANA SMITH: You need another reason to go out and get a drink during the big game.JOSH SHAFER: In the spirit of that--ALLIE CANAL: In the spirit of that, but talking about spirits, though, that's actually only up 2% while wine is up 3%. So maybe a little sangria action if you don't want the beer. That's a cheaper option.DAVID BRIGGS: Not bad.ALLIE CANAL: But, overall, I think for the Super Bowl people, people want to drink their beer.DAVID BRIGGS: Wings versus boneless wings, Allie. You are the expert. We have them both here. Seana and I are team boneless.SEANA SMITH: We are.ALLIE CANAL: I'm not Team Boneless. I am--SEANA SMITH: We're on a little island by ourselves.ALLIE CANAL: I'm bone-in, but I'm flats over drumsticks all day.SEANA SMITH: Oh, yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah.SEANA SMITH: What about you?JOSH SCHAFER: No, I'm absolutely bone-in. I am of the take that if you have boneless wings, they're actually just--ALLIE CANAL: That just looks sad.JOSH SCHAFER: --those are chicken nuggets. Those are chicken nuggets. Those are chicken nuggets.DAVID BRIGGS: Josh, Seana, Allie--SEANA SMITH: I will eat them all to myself.DAVID BRIGGS: --thank you, guys. That'll do it for our big game coverage. Enjoy the weekend. Enjoy the Super Bowl. And we'll see you on Monday.ALLIE CANAL: Go Birds.]"

This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 3.6%. Check out our latest analysis for Phillips 66 Phillips 66's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. Before making this announcement, Phillips 66 was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 58.0%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 43%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendPhillips 66 Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.80, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $3.88. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 17% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that Phillips 66 has grown earnings per share at 19% per year over the past five years. Phillips 66 definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.Phillips 66 Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for Phillips 66 (of which 1 can't be ignored!) you should know about. Is Phillips 66 not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

After two months of being squeezed by the Group of Seven’s crude price cap, Vladimir Putin’s regime has apparently had enough, saying it will cut its oil production - just as the European Union follows the United States in banning all forms of Russian energy while the G7 instituted another cap on Russian fuel prices.Russia will slash its oil production by 5%, or 500,000 barrels per day, from March, Deputy Prime Minister and de facto energy minister Alexander Novak announced on Friday.“Russia believes the price cap mechanism for selling Russian oil and oil products interferes with market relations,” Novak said. “It continues the destructive energy policy of the countries of the collective west.”OPEC+, the alliance of 23 oil producers that Saudi Arabia leads with Russia’s assistance, has nothing to do with the cuts planned by Russia, Novak said - just in case the Biden administration seems to think the House of Saud is once again helping its comrade-in-distress Putin to weaponize energy.The United States singled out the Saudis for criticism last year when OPEC+ announced a 2-million-bpd cut in October, which was seen by Washington as an outright attempt to bolster Russia’s war against Ukraine. Instead of being helpful, the OPEC+ cut was a prelude to a 9% drop in crude prices between November and January as Chinese demand for oil tanked from COVID-19 restrictions and fears of a global recession spiked.Aside from Novak’s announcement on Friday, Reuters, citing energy industry officials in Moscow, reported that the Kremlin plans to set a fixed $20 per barrel differential for its Urals crude to dated contracts of global benchmark Brent for “tax purposes”.Russia currently uses Urals price assessments in Europe's Rotterdam and Augusta ports, provided by commodity price reporting agency Argus, to determine its mineral extraction tax, additional income tax, oil export duty and reverse excise on oil.Story continuesAccording to data issued by the finance ministry in Moscow, the average price of its Urals in January was $49.48 a barrel, down 42% from January 2022.“The ‘Empire Strikes Back’ is what I’d call it, in this case, the Russian empire,” Phil Flynn, an energy analyst and self-proclaimed oil bull at Chicago’s Price Futures Group, told Investing.com.“Putin is betting that the West is going to need all these energy products they are shutting themselves off from and that ultimately they will hurt more from these sanctions, despite the hurt they want to cause Russia. It’s a question of who calls whose bluff.”Knowing the Russians’ aggressiveness when they are pushed to the wall, Flynn says Moscow’s response could play out in ways that the West might not like.In his energy market note on Friday, Flynn said Russian deputy premier Novak did not only announce the production cut or reiterate Moscow’s stand that it will not sell oil to any country that directly or indirectly adheres to the G7 cap.“Novak also warned, in what could be a veiled threat, that the price caps could be applied to other global economic sectors,” Flynn wrote. “That could be a threat to grain and perhaps platinum and palladium that the Biden administration will need in its push for electric cars. Russia is the world’s top producer of palladium and the world’s second-largest producer of platinum.”“There is also a threat that Russia’s aggressive attitude could block Ukrainian grain exports in what will be a much smaller Ukrainian crop.”The G7 responded swiftly to the Russian announcements, cautioning oil consumers that Moscow might be trying to pull off a stunt. “It is critical not to take Russian statements about oil production cuts at face value,” Reuters quoted a G7 Price Cap Coalition official as saying.Historically, OPEC+ countries have often put out more crude than they said, although under-investment in oil fields since the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to produce like before.“Global energy markets remain stable, with benchmarks largely unchanged since the implementation of the crude cap in December,” the G7 official said. “According to public reporting, a large volume of Russian seaborne oil was delivered via price cap-compliant tankers.”The official added that the price cap - of $60 per barrel on Russian crude and at $100 on diesel and $45 on fuel oil and naphtha - “continues to meet its dual objectives”.The U.S. Treasury Department has repeatedly said that it wants to limit what the Kremlin can earn per barrel in order to squeeze Moscow’s funding for the war in Ukraine, while ensuring Russian oil supplies reach markets that needed them.On that score, the G7 official said “any Russian production cuts will disproportionately hurt developing countries”.Besides the G7 response, the economic data out of Moscow shows the Russian economy teetering into riskier waters as Putin pushes to somehow win a war he began almost a year ago and which has isolated his country from most of the world.Russia's current account surplus hit a record high in 2022, as a fall in imports and robust oil and gas exports kept foreign money flowing in despite Western efforts to isolate the Russian economy over the conflict in Ukraine.But Moscow is now contending with sharply lower export revenues, down 35.1% year-on-year in January, in part due to price caps and embargoes on Russian oil and gas products.Energy revenues were particularly low in January, down 46.4%. The slumping revenues, combined with soaring expenditure, pushed Russia's federal budget to a deficit of 1.76 trillion roubles ($24.2 billion) in the first month of the year.Lower export volumes saw Russia's current account surplus shrink 58.2% to $8 billion in January, the central bank said on Thursday, squeezing Russia's capital buffers at a time when Moscow is ramping up budget spending.The current account, a measure of the difference between all money coming into a country through trade, investment and transfers, and what flows back out, stood at $19.1 billion in January 2021.Demand-wise as well, Russian energy has pretty much only two buyers now: India and China.“At this point, having choked Indian and Chinese refineries with so much oil in recent months, the Russians might have to wait out the next round of demand from these refiners, who, don’t forget, are re-exporting part of the Russian crude they are buying as finished fuel products,” John Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, told Investing.com.“So, India and China, besides their own consumption, need to find end-markets for the Russian oil they are buying as well. Yes, the rock-bottom Russian crude prices have been great for the profits of Indian and Chinese refiners. But now, they may have reached an inflection point for demand. Everyone’s competing for that same Asian market share. So, the Russian production cut here might be a forced situation, rather than a voluntary one.”Despite typically holding a negative bet against oil, Kilduff concedes that there could be some near-term pressure on energy consumers from the mind games played by Russia and the West.“From the consumers’ perspective, everything has to go perfectly for prices to continue staying flat to lower,” Kilduff said. “I liken it sort of to the New York City commuter traffic. Tons of volume goes through, you get to work pretty much fine every day. But you have one little accident, and now you’re looking at an hour-and-a-half to get across to the George Washington Bridge.”But all said, the G7 and the White House seem “pretty happy with the way their price cap has worked”, said Kilduff.“The Russians have been yelling from the rooftops that the cap is ‘stupid’. But the fact of the matter is it has succeeded in forcing them to sell to the lowest bidders in India and China. And they are hurting from that.”“Also, we are in a flat demand period ahead of the pick-up for summer. The market shouldn’t really be missing the Russian barrels right now.”Oil: Market Settlements and Activity Oil markets jumped as Russia hit back at the G7’s price caps by announcing production cuts and its own minimum price structure.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March did a final trade of $79.76 per barrel on Friday, after officially settling the session at $79.72, up $1.66, or 2.1%. The session high was $80.33, its loftiest since Jan. 30.For the week, the U.S. crude benchmark was up almost 9%, overwriting the previous week’s 7.5% plunge.London-traded Brent crude for March delivery had a final trade of $86.52 after finishing the regular session at $86.39, up $1.89, or 2.2%. The session peak was $86.90.Brent was up 8% on the week, erasing the previous week’s 7.5% decline.Oil plunged the previous week on the back of recession fears and uncertainty in U.S. interest rates' direction after bumper job and wage gains among Americans in January threatened to bump up inflation.During the week in review, oil rebounded on the premise that Chinese refiners would add exponentially to imports this month as the country returns from the long Lunar New Year break and into an environment free of COVID-19 restrictions which had previously hampered demand.However, Chinese import data supporting such a market run-up will likely not emerge for weeks. Latest available data showed the world’s largest crude importer bought 10.98 million bpd, or barrels per day, in January, down from December's 11.37M bpd and November's 11.42M bpd.Running counter to the just-ended week’s bullish sentiment in oil were large builds across the board in crude, gasoline and distillates in the Weekly Petroleum Status Report released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.Oil: Price OutlookWTI’s long consolidation within $72.25 support and $82.65 resistance creates a potential price range with a $10 sideplay, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.Though WTI’s daily chart shows the possibility of a bullish continuation, with the RSI, or Relative Strength Index, at 54 - positioned above neutrality of 50 - the confluence of the 50-Day EMA, or Exponential Moving Average, with the Daily Middle Bollinger Band calls for caution, Dixit said.“The market will prefer to monitor reaction to the 100-Day SMA (Simple Moving Average) of $81.08, followed by the horizontal resistance of $82.70 for any breakout and retest, before taking a broader bullish call.”Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The selloff in natural gas paused Friday, with the market posting its first weekly gain in eight, as bears in the market reassessed their positions after taking the heating fuel to 2-½ year lows in the previous session.The front-month March gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.580 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units on Friday, Investing.com data showed. The official settlement for the session was $2.514, up 6.9 cents, or 2.8%.For the week, the benchmark U.S. gas contract rose 4.3%, posting its first weekly gain since the week ended Dec. 9. Gas futures lost a cumulative 63% in seven weeks prior to that.On Thursday, March gas fell to $2.351, plumbing the lowest level for a front-month gas contract on the Henry Hub since Sept. 28, 2020, when the benchmark contract then went down to $2.02.An unusually warm start to the 2022/23 winter season has led to considerably less heating demand in the United States versus the norm, leaving more gas in storage than initially thought.At the close of last week, U.S. gas-in-storage stood at 2.366 tcf, or trillion cubic feet, up 10.9% from the year-ago level of 2.133 tcf, data from the EIA, or Energy Information Administration, showed.Utilities drew a higher-than-forecast 217 bcf, or billion cubic feet, from storage for heating and electricity generation last week, the EIA said.Analysts tracked by Investing.com had expected a draw of 195 bcf for the week ended Feb. 3, above the consumption of 151 bcf seen in the prior week to Jan. 27.“The bullishness of the withdrawal was driven by colder-than-normal temperatures, especially at the end of the reflective storage week,” analysts at Houston-based energy markets consultancy Gelber &amp; Associates said. “However, improving imbalances such as this aren’t significantly meaningful when they’re not accompanied by a supportive temperature outlook.”Responding to the warmth and lackluster storage draws, gas prices plunged from a 14-year high of $10 per mmBtu in August, reaching $7 in December and mid-$2 levels this week amid forecasts for bitter cold here and there.Natural gas: Price OutlookNatural gas’ RSI and Stochastics lack signs of an end to its bearish correction despite prevailing oversold conditions, said Dixit of SKCharting.“The $2 support remains intact for now,” said Dixit. “But if the $2.35 support is broken followed by a failed $2.18, then another headlong plunge will follow.”On the other hand, temporary optimism may reflect on some weak shorts being covered, he said. “In this aspect, if $2.68 is breached, followed by a breakout reaching $2.989, then the upside could stretch.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold for April delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,876.50 on Friday, after officially settling the session at $1,874.50, down $4 or 0.2%.For the week, however, April gold was up 0.6%.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled on Friday at $1,865.93, up $4.19, or 0.2%. For the week, the spot price was virtually flat.Gold: Price Outlook Going further into next week, spot gold’s sustainability above $1,856 will help it get some bounce towards $1,872 and $1,878 - which is a critical barrier to cross over to the further resistance zone of $1,886 and $1,893, said Dixit.“Sustainability below $1,856 will prompt a quick retest of $1,852, which is the acceleration point for a further drop to $1,842 and $1,832, with our own bearish target of $1,828, which coincides with the 38.2% Fibonacci level,” he added.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related Articles'The grass does not grow': In Chile's far south, the worst drought in 50 yearsOil prices rise over 2% on Russian plan to cut output]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 countries that produce the best athletes in the world.Sports has always fascinated people, from thousands of years ago to today. While fame has always been a given for athletes, with the level of fame depending on the popularity of the sport they've engaged in, the world of sports has changed significantly in the last century especially in terms of money. Half a century ago, only players at the very top of the game earned handsome salaries with most of the other players not earning more than the average person.15 countries that produce the best athletes in the worldNowadays, every corner of the world is inundated with sporting events including World Cups of different sports, with the most popular by far being the FIFA World Cup for football. The latest event was held in Qatar, which spend billions officially on ensuring that the World Cup was a massive success, which it did end up being. With the popularity of such sports, many sporting companies have become multi-billion dollar empires and provide sponsorships to top athletes to ensure that their name is out there front and center, with such companies including NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), which is worth nearly $200 billion currently and is the biggest sporting company in the world, Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UA) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU).These companies have realized the massive potential and returns that they can earn in the sporting world, with NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) arguably being the most successful company in this field. For many countries, their sporting market is an important part of their influence and an excellent source of revenue as well, as can seen in England where the England Premier League brings in revenues worth billions of pounds and is the highest-earning football league in the world. In the U.S., while most popular sports such as baseball, basketball and American football are popular in the country alone, they still bring in some of the highest revenue for any sports leagues in the world because of the American obsession with these sports. This is why some of the most valuable sports companies in the world are American sports teams. This is why many nations are investing heavily in discovering and supporting athletes, especially the countries that produce the best athletes in the world.Story continuesWhile many are calling out the sports world for exorbitant values and paying unbelievable salaries to athletes, changes seem unlikely considering the ever increasing demand for sports by spectators and the revenue that TV streaming rights provide to various sporting leagues. That's why many people consider sports clubs as investment opportunities. After all, Chelsea Football Club, one of the most successful football clubs in the world in the last two decades, was sold for £4.25 billion in 2022. 19 years ago, Roman Abramovich bought the club for a reported £140 million. That is a return of over 3,000% in 19 years. Sales of Liverpool Football Club and Manchester United plc (NYSE:MANU), the two most successful English football clubs in history, which are seeming more likely as time passes by, will also see huge returns for owners.To determine the countries that produce the best athletes, we couldn't focus on any one sport as many nations participate in different competitions and have superiority over the other in different competitions. This is why the Olympics were the best option for our ranking, as the Olympics have hundreds of events across all sports and athletics, showcasing the best from each country in various fields. The Olympics are interesting from an economical point of view as massive costs to host the Olympics continue to increase while benefits are uncertain, leaving countries with a massive loss which is why fewer countries are now bidding to host one of the most prestigious competitions in the world. According to a 2012 study by the University of Oxford, from 1976 to 2012, the average cost overrun for each Summer Olympics is around 252%. Despite this, over 250 companies advertise in the Olympics even though companies which aren't official partner of the Olympics aren't even allowed to use the term ""Olympics"".  We obtained data for the last 3 Olympic events, and combined each country's haul in gold, silver and bronze medals, assigning 50% weightage to each country's ranking for total gold medals, 30% weightage to each country's ranking for total silver medals, and 20% weightage to each country's ranking for total bronze medals. So, without further, ado, let's take a look at the athletic nations, starting with:15. SpainTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 14Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 22Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 18Spain has ensured that it is counted among the best sporting countries in the world through meticulous planning and execution. Surprisingly, despite the U.S. dominating basketball over almost a century, winning 16 of 19 tournaments in the Summer Olympics, Spain is currently ranked as the top team in basketball according to the International Basketball Federation.14. HungaryTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 22Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 14Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 17Hungary has excelled in sports where there are multiple opportunities of winning medals, which is why despite a small population, it has collected over 50 medals in the last 3 Olympics.13. New ZealandTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 17Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 17Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 17New Zealand has the smallest population by far among countries in our list, which is why it is amazing that it is still counted among the countries that produce the best athletes.12. BrazilTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 17Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 17Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 23The most successful country in athletics in Latin America, the culture in Brazil regarding sports is one of the main reasons behind the country's success.11. NetherlandsTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 24Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 25Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 26Despite a smaller population especially relative to most other countries in the list of the countries that produce the best athletes, a strong national coordination of activities has ensured that the Dutch continue to produce top athletes, with the government spending tens of millions of euros each year to ensure development of top talent in various sports.10. South KoreaTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 28Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 16Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 27One of the most successful country in athletics in Asia, South Korea is easily among the countries that produce the best athletes in the world. However, the country is also emerging among the best in the world of esports, which is an industry with massive growth potential and could be ripe for potential investment.9. ItalyTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 26Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 31Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 39Sports in Italy have had a long, storied tradition and while it is the second most successful football team in the world with four World Cups and are the current reigning European champions, Italy has also made a successful foray into various other sports with its men and women's teams considered to be among the best in the world.8. FranceTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 31Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 41Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 38Sports are part of France's culture and hosts some of the most prestigious sporting evens in the world including Tour de France and the French Open, while also winning the football World Cup in 2018. The country has also achieved significant success in the Olympics.7. AustraliaTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 33Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 33Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 44Australia is easily among the countries that produce the best athletes, having won over 100 medals in the last 3 Olympics. This success is despite a relatively smaller population of just over 22 million people, and in terms of medals per capita, it would be far ahead of even the U.S.6. GermanyTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 38Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 41Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 44Germany is one of the most successful football nations in the world, winning four World Cups and three Euros, but its success has extended to various other sports as well.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Countries that Produce the Best Athletes in the World. Suggested articles:12 Best Low Priced Dividend Stocks To Buy11 Most Undervalued Foreign Stocks To Buy15 Most Undervalued NASDAQ StocksDisclosure: None. 15 Countries that Produce the Best Athletes in the World is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

Caesars promoted heavily leading up to last year’s Super Bowl, offering system credit match up to a deposit of $3,000. The operator also added a $300 bonus, meaning if a user deposited $3,000 into their account, they would have $3,300 of free play money courtesy of the sportsbook.This helped Caesars gain early market share, but it didn’t translate to sustained success. The company started the year ahead in monthly gross gaming revenue, per the New York State Commission, but finished 2022 handily in third place.""We're going to target our promotional spending at our profitable customers, which is going to be a much smaller subset of that larger group,"" Caesars CEO Reeg told investors after the first quarter.'It's going to continue to grow'Since adding customers at any cost hasn’t proven to be a sustainable model, industry leaders are steering customers toward areas where their sportsbook stands to profit more handsomely.Sportsbooks are heavily promoting their live betting offerings.

(NYSE:ZTS) Looks Like A Quality Company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-zoetis-inc-nyse-zts-140024846.html,1676124024,STORY,['ZTS'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS), by way of a worked example.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Zoetis is:44% = US$2.1b ÷ US$4.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.44 in profit.Does Zoetis Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Zoetis has a better ROE than the average (17%) in the Pharmaceuticals industry.roeThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining Zoetis' Debt And Its 44% Return On EquityZoetis clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.42. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification.

47,caae09da-85cc-3382-b1ae-fde744eee8c9,NEE,2023-02-12,The 7 Safest Stocks You Can Buy in February 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-safest-stocks-buy-february-160328041.html,1675872208,STORY,"['UNH', 'NEE-PR', 'LMT', 'PEP', 'PG', 'HSY', 'KO']","[With the economy and the stock market not fully out of the woods, my suggestion is to focus on the safest stocks at the moment. With the most recent statements from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggesting that interest rates will keep rising, and that a “Fed pivot” isn’t just around the corner, the overall market’s strong performance over the past month could give way to another broad market sell-off.That in mind, now is the time to cycle back into safe stocks. Offering lower volatility, steady dividends, and the potential for gradual appreciation, these seven safest stocks could also receive a short-term lift, if today’s “risk-on” investors seek safer harbors.HSYHershey$236.29LMTLockheed Martin$469.64NEENextEra Energy$75.96PEPPepsiCo$170.78PGProcter &amp; Gamble$139.21PMPhilip Morris$101.56UNHUnitedHealth$480.89InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHershey (HSY)Source: ShutterstockShares of Hershey (NYSE:HSY) have continued to perform strongly. Shares stayed in the green during 2022, as HSY’s underlying business continued to “crush it,” despite challenges such as inflationary pressures. So far in 2023, HSY stock has continued to perform well, even as investors opt for the riskiest stocks rather than the safest stocks. However, if sentiment soon changes again, Hershey may not necessarily join in on the sell-off.  In fact, if the company continues reporting strong earnings growth, as it did in its latest quarterly results, shares could keep climbing higher.Besides appreciation potential, and very low volatility (HSY’s beta, or volatility compared to the overall market is 0.35). This stock also provides investors with a steady, growing dividend (1.71% forward yield). The company has raised its payout by an average of 8.74% annually over the past five years.Lockheed Martin (LMT)An F-16 and an F-35 model at the background, at the Lockheed Martin exhibition stand in Thessaloniki International Fair.Source: Giannis Papanikos / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) isn’t just a defense stock, it’s a defensive stock as well. With the recession-resistant nature of its business, it’s a high quality stock to buy and hold in all markets. While shares initially pulled back at the start of 2023, shares in this low-beta (0.68) stock are bouncing back.Story continuesTo some extent, this LMT stock rebound may be happening on the heels of a recent analyst double-upgrade. On Feb. 6, Credit Suisse’s Scott Deuschle raised his rating on LMT from “underperform” to “outperform,” basing his decision to upgrade on factors such as the defense contractor’s rising book-to-bill ratio, a sign of growth re-acceleration.Shares could potentially move higher in the coming year, in tandem with this expected earnings growth. This safe stock also offers investors steady returns, via its 2.56% dividend. LMT has a 20-year track record of dividend growth.NextEra Energy (NEE)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockIt’s no secret that many of the safest stocks are utilities stocks. Yet among scores of choices, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) may be your best bet. Yes, NEE’s beta (0.44) is on par with most utility stocks in the sector. Shares in this Florida-based electric power company also sell at a valuation premium to other major names in the sector.So then, what exactly makes NEE stock a standout among utilities? That would be its high exposure to the renewable energy megatrend. As InvestorPlace’s Josh Enomoto argued last month, NEE’s clean energy business will keep driving growth, which explains why the stock is a favorite among sell-side analysts.In turn, continued earnings growth likely means continued dividend growth. While offering a lower yield (2.25%) than peers, NEE has raised its payout by an average of 11.6% annually over the past five years.PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockThe consumer staples sector is another area chock full of safe stocks. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is one to consider adding as a safe harbor play. Sure, you may be thinking, why PEP rather than Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock?Yes, PEP stock and KO stock are similar in terms of their main business (soft drink), as well as stock-related metrics like beta (0.57 for PEP, 0.56 for KO) and valuation (mid-20s earnings multiple for both). Still, something else may give PEP the edge in this “cola stock war.”PEP and KO are each dividend kings, and KO does sport a slightly higher yield (2.93%, versus PEP’s 2.68%). However, raising its payout by an average of 7.4% over the past five years, versus an average of 3.53% for Coca-Cola, a higher level of dividend growth may enable PEP to outperform its longstanding rival going forward.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comProcter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a blue chip stock straight out of central casting. A more than century-old business, shares in this household products powerhouse have rewarded investors for generations, with steady dividends and growth.Even today, owning PG stock can provide your portfolio with solid returns. Investors seeking safety should appreciate its super-low beta of 0.4. Although shares may seem pricey, at around 24.5 times earnings, PG is likely to maintain this valuation, as it continues to consistently grow earnings.Current sell-side estimates call for earnings growth of around 8.2% next fiscal year (ending June 2024), and 9% in FY 2025. Add in PG’s 2.58% dividend, which has increased in each of the past 66 years, and it’s clear that Procter &amp; Gamble shares are in a strong position to provide investors with satisfactory returns, with much lower volatility than the overall stock market.Philip Morris (PM)packs of cigarettes in convenience store rackSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.comAmong top tobacco stocks, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) could be the safest in the bunch. Although it trades at a higher valuation, and a slightly higher beta than, say, its former parent company Altria Group (NYSE:MO), the company’s greater level of success so far with going “smoke free” may give its shares an extra degree of safety.As I argued recently, PM’s IQOS heated tobacco product, plus its recent purchase of smokeless tobacco and nicotine products maker Swedish Match, give it far greater exposure to growing segments of the tobacco industry. This could outweigh any possible declines in its legacy cigarette business, if the smoking rate keeps dropping.In addition to greater growth potential, PM stock also offers investors a solid dividend (forward yield of 4.97%). This dividend has grown steadily, increasing by an average of 3.62% annually over the past five years.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)UNH Stock Have Four More YearsSource: ShutterstockSelling off recently, on news of a lower-than-expected increase in Medicare Advantage payments this year, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) may not be acting like a safe stock right now.However, when looking on a longer timeframe, UNH stock remains less volatile than the overall stock market, with a beta of 0.69. This provider of health insurance and related services is not only still a safe stock. UnitedHealth Group remains a high-quality growth stock as well.Analyst forecasts continue to call for UNH to grow its earnings by double-digits over the next two years. Chances are that achieving this will result in a similarly-sized move higher for shares. Along with earnings growth, UNH offers investors the opportunity for dividend growth as well. While its current payout may seem low (1.39%), UnitedHealth has raised its dividend by an average of 17.4% annually over the past five years.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel held MO.

Payments are usually made on a regular basis, quarterly, monthly, or annually, and provide a steady stream of income. So they are a popular choice for investors looking for a more passive way to earn income.And like any other asset, they can be classified by their risk profile. In general, the higher the yield, the greater the risk associated with a given dividend stock. This list favors a more moderate-risk investment style and features many dividend aristocrats. Dividend aristocrats are shares of companies that have increased their dividends for each of the past 25 years. They are among the most reliable ways of building wealth in the stock market, period.TickerCompanyPriceNEENextEra Energy$76.08PMPhilip Morris$102.20CATCaterpillar$249.66ALBAlbemarle$279.34AFLAflac$69.95CVXChevron$174.09LLYEli Lilly$339.68InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBest Dividend Stocks: NextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) stock is an investment in a leading Florida-based energy company. The company spans multiple related business segments. It operates one of the largest electric power companies in the world. That subsidiary, Florida Power &amp; Light Company, focuses on generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity. It also operates one of the largest renewable energy businesses in the world, with a portfolio of wind and solar projects.Investors can expect NextEra Energy to continue to grow its dividend by 10% annually through at least 2024, as outlined in its Jan. 25 Q4 earnings report. Over the last five years, NextEra Energy has grown its dividend at a rate of 11.6%, so investors should not be surprised at the news.NextEra Energy’s utility business, Florida Power &amp; Light, accounted for $4.071 billion of the company’s $6.164 billion in Q4 revenues. Its solar and wind business accounted for $2.093 billion in revenues during the same period. NEE stock represents a potent but reliable mix of growth and stability. Thus, it is among the best dividend stocks to buy.Story continuesPhilip Morris (PM)An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.comInvesting in Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) stock might seem like a losing proposition. The company made its fortune selling cigarettes which continue to see falling demand. It might therefore seem like a case of trying to catch the proverbial falling knife.But there are several reasons to consider Philip Morris, not least of which is its dividend yielding 4.98%. That is a relatively high yield in the world of dividends, but investors can rest assured that it’s quite safe, given that it hasn’t been reduced since 2008.The interesting narrative in favor of PM stock is that the company is leading the shift away from cigarette sales and into smokeless tobacco and smoke-free products. Philip Morris intends to derive 50% of revenues from smoke-free products by 2025. Its competitors, Altria (NYSE:MO) and British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI), currently depend on cigarettes for more than 80% of revenues.The company controls 59% of the global smokeless tobacco market and looks to be leading the way into the next evolutionary iteration of the smoking market. That makes it among the best dividend stocks to buy in my book.Best Dividend Stocks: Caterpillar (CAT)stocks to buySource: ShutterstockCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) stock represents a leading global manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, and industrial gas turbines. The company serves industries including construction, energy, transportation, and mining.There’s really a lot to like about Caterpillar in relation to its dividend. It’s very dependable, having last been reduced in 1992. Its payout ratio of 0.37 lends further credence to the idea that it will continue to be dependable as the ratio is well within the healthy/ideal range. And Caterpillar’s dividend has grown at a rate of 8.6% over the past five years, largely in line with expected stock market growth rates.Caterpillar is also seeing a period of strong demand currently, with sales increasing 20% this quarter YoY. Sales increased by $1.74 billion this quarter, partially due to higher prices. However, sales volumes increased by $1.56 billion, meaning inflation was not the driving factor alone. The strong dollar resulted in a $523 million reduction in sales as sales made in other currencies had to be remunerated in more expensive USD.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) stock is most noted for lithium and bromine production. But the company is involved in the production of a wide range of chemical products that include other catalysts and polymers. Its association with the rapidly growing EV market has garnered lots of attention for the stock, and rightly so: Albemarle is a large-scale producer in a lithium market expected to grow at an annual rate of 12% between 2022 and 2028.In addition to the secular growth trends favoring ALB stock as an investment, it also includes a very reliable dividend with an ultra-low payout ratio. That dividend was last reduced in 1994 and sports a payout ratio of 0.12. That means Albemarle pays about 12% of earnings to investors in the form of dividends, which is very low.ALB stock has roughly $25 of upside above its current price of $289 based on analysts’ consensus prices. However, some believe it could rise as high as $497.Aflac (AFL)the Aflac (AFL) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAflac (NYSE:AFL) sells various insurance products across the U.S. and Japan. The company is probably best known for its supplemental life and health insurance products and is considered a blue-chip stock with stable prices and a reliable dividend that hasn’t been reduced since 1983.Aflac’s reliability serves the company’s stock well, as recent earnings prove. Although the company’s total revenues decreased by 11.8% in 2022 from 2021, share prices are relatively steady. In fact, Aflac’s revenues decreased by 26.2% in Q4 on a YoY basis. However, share prices only declined a few dollars.I’d argue that pieces haven’t dropped much because of Aflac’s blue-chip status but also because EPS estimates are rising for the coming quarters. A few months ago, it was expected that Aflac would provide a Q1 EPS of $1.34. That number now stands at $1.39. The same is true for Q2 EPS estimates which have risen from $1.36 to $1.42, making it among the best dividend stocks.Chevron (CVX)Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) had an excellent 2022 that should pave the way forward for continued strength in its stock. The company’s Jan. 27 earnings report reflected a banner year for the company and the energy sector at large.As one of the largest and highest-profile energy companies known for rewarding investors, Chevron’s earnings are highly important. The company uses those earnings to reward investors through stock buybacks and dividend payouts. So earnings, as opposed to revenues, are particularly relevant. Fortunately, both were exceptionally high throughout 2022 on record prices.Chevron earned $35.47 billion in 2022, far more than the $15.63 it earned in 2021. Chevron paid $11 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends in 2022 and a further $11.25 billion in share purchases. The company reported $37.6 billion in free cash flow in 2022. That free cash flow can be invested in any way the company sees fit. Current speculation suggests that Chevron could soon acquire one of its European rivals because of their lower valuations coupled with Chevron’s strong free cash position.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock remains in a strong position even as sales of its popular drug Mounjaro failed to meet expectations. In terms of dividends, Eli Lilly is rock-solid, having last reduced its dividend in 1986. So, as a reliable passive income source, LLY stock certainly has merits.But most investors are currently interested in Eli Lilly’s shares because of the potential of Mounjaro, its diabetes drug that is also seeking FDA approval for weight loss.Mounjaro was expected to account for $319 million of sales in Q4 but fell short with $279.2 million in sales. That disappointment caused a temporary decline in LLY shares. But shares quickly rebounded. There are a few factors at play here. One, Eli Lilly’s EPS of $2.09 beat the $1.78 expected on Wall Street. But more importantly, Mounjaro is still awaiting FDA approval for marketing as a weight loss drug.The company expects to receive FDA approval for Mounjaro as a weight loss drug next year, and sales are expected to exceed $2 billion in 2023.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

View our latest analysis for Masco Masco's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. However, prior to this announcement, Masco's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 16.6%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 31% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendMasco Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.30, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.14. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 14% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Masco has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 23% per annum. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.Masco Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Masco is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. To that end, Masco has 3 warning signs (and 1 which is potentially serious) we think you should know about. Is Masco not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

They must “work towards an energy transition that is orderly, inclusive and helps ensure energy security for all.”His comments came amid a shift among some Western governments and companies regarding fossil fuels. Prices for oil, natural gas and coal surged after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last February, pushing energy security to the top of the agenda for many leaders.US President Joe Biden went off-script during his State of the Union speech last week and said: “We’re going to need oil for at least another decade.” In Europe, Shell Plc signaled it will stop accelerating spending on renewable energy, while BP Plc slowed its planned reduction of oil and gas output.OPEC’s Al-Ghais said the oil industry had been “plagued by several years of chronic underinvestment.” It needs $500 billion of investment annually until 2045, he said.The United Arab Emirates’ hosting of the COP28 climate summit in late 2023 will “serve as a fresh opportunity to explore inclusive, sustainable and consensus-based solutions to climate change,” said the secretary-general, who’s from OPEC member Kuwait.The UAE, also part of OPEC, has appointed Sultan Al Jaber, head of national oil and gas firm Adnoc, as president for the summit. While that’s caused some controversy, Al Jaber has said that hydrocarbon producers must be at the forefront of climate talks if the world is to transition to cleaner energy while also ensuring that fuel prices remain affordable.Story continuesAl Ghais reiterated that OPEC and its partners — known as OPEC+, the 23-nation alliance is led by Saudi Arabia and Russia — are committed to keeping the oil market stable.Saudi Arabia and other core OPEC members are unlikely to respond to Russia’s announcement on Friday of a production cut by pumping more, Bloomberg reported.While Moscow indicated late last year that it may reduce output as a retaliation against Western sanctions, crude prices still jumped on Friday.

52,042a1cd3-bbd3-3cf7-9144-6b9601ace1af,MA,2023-02-12,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-051614829.html,1676178974,STORY,"['PA=F', 'NG=F', 'PL=F', 'GC=F']","[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com -- Who will call whose bluff? After two months of being squeezed by the Group of Seven’s crude price cap, Vladimir Putin’s regime has apparently had enough, saying it will cut its oil production - just as the European Union follows the United States in banning all forms of Russian energy while the G7 instituted another cap on Russian fuel prices.Russia will slash its oil production by 5%, or 500,000 barrels per day, from March, Deputy Prime Minister and de facto energy minister Alexander Novak announced on Friday.“Russia believes the price cap mechanism for selling Russian oil and oil products interferes with market relations,” Novak said. “It continues the destructive energy policy of the countries of the collective west.”OPEC+, the alliance of 23 oil producers that Saudi Arabia leads with Russia’s assistance, has nothing to do with the cuts planned by Russia, Novak said - just in case the Biden administration seems to think the House of Saud is once again helping its comrade-in-distress Putin to weaponize energy.The United States singled out the Saudis for criticism last year when OPEC+ announced a 2-million-bpd cut in October, which was seen by Washington as an outright attempt to bolster Russia’s war against Ukraine. Instead of being helpful, the OPEC+ cut was a prelude to a 9% drop in crude prices between November and January as Chinese demand for oil tanked from COVID-19 restrictions and fears of a global recession spiked.Aside from Novak’s announcement on Friday, Reuters, citing energy industry officials in Moscow, reported that the Kremlin plans to set a fixed $20 per barrel differential for its Urals crude to dated contracts of global benchmark Brent for “tax purposes”.Russia currently uses Urals price assessments in Europe's Rotterdam and Augusta ports, provided by commodity price reporting agency Argus, to determine its mineral extraction tax, additional income tax, oil export duty and reverse excise on oil.Story continuesAccording to data issued by the finance ministry in Moscow, the average price of its Urals in January was $49.48 a barrel, down 42% from January 2022.“The ‘Empire Strikes Back’ is what I’d call it, in this case, the Russian empire,” Phil Flynn, an energy analyst and self-proclaimed oil bull at Chicago’s Price Futures Group, told Investing.com.“Putin is betting that the West is going to need all these energy products they are shutting themselves off from and that ultimately they will hurt more from these sanctions, despite the hurt they want to cause Russia. It’s a question of who calls whose bluff.”Knowing the Russians’ aggressiveness when they are pushed to the wall, Flynn says Moscow’s response could play out in ways that the West might not like.In his energy market note on Friday, Flynn said Russian deputy premier Novak did not only announce the production cut or reiterate Moscow’s stand that it will not sell oil to any country that directly or indirectly adheres to the G7 cap.“Novak also warned, in what could be a veiled threat, that the price caps could be applied to other global economic sectors,” Flynn wrote. “That could be a threat to grain and perhaps platinum and palladium that the Biden administration will need in its push for electric cars. Russia is the world’s top producer of palladium and the world’s second-largest producer of platinum.”“There is also a threat that Russia’s aggressive attitude could block Ukrainian grain exports in what will be a much smaller Ukrainian crop.”The G7 responded swiftly to the Russian announcements, cautioning oil consumers that Moscow might be trying to pull off a stunt. “It is critical not to take Russian statements about oil production cuts at face value,” Reuters quoted a G7 Price Cap Coalition official as saying.Historically, OPEC+ countries have often put out more crude than they said, although under-investment in oil fields since the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to produce like before.“Global energy markets remain stable, with benchmarks largely unchanged since the implementation of the crude cap in December,” the G7 official said. “According to public reporting, a large volume of Russian seaborne oil was delivered via price cap-compliant tankers.”The official added that the price cap - of $60 per barrel on Russian crude and at $100 on diesel and $45 on fuel oil and naphtha - “continues to meet its dual objectives”.The U.S. Treasury Department has repeatedly said that it wants to limit what the Kremlin can earn per barrel in order to squeeze Moscow’s funding for the war in Ukraine, while ensuring Russian oil supplies reach markets that needed them.On that score, the G7 official said “any Russian production cuts will disproportionately hurt developing countries”.Besides the G7 response, the economic data out of Moscow shows the Russian economy teetering into riskier waters as Putin pushes to somehow win a war he began almost a year ago and which has isolated his country from most of the world.Russia's current account surplus hit a record high in 2022, as a fall in imports and robust oil and gas exports kept foreign money flowing in despite Western efforts to isolate the Russian economy over the conflict in Ukraine.But Moscow is now contending with sharply lower export revenues, down 35.1% year-on-year in January, in part due to price caps and embargoes on Russian oil and gas products.Energy revenues were particularly low in January, down 46.4%. The slumping revenues, combined with soaring expenditure, pushed Russia's federal budget to a deficit of 1.76 trillion roubles ($24.2 billion) in the first month of the year.Lower export volumes saw Russia's current account surplus shrink 58.2% to $8 billion in January, the central bank said on Thursday, squeezing Russia's capital buffers at a time when Moscow is ramping up budget spending.The current account, a measure of the difference between all money coming into a country through trade, investment and transfers, and what flows back out, stood at $19.1 billion in January 2021.Demand-wise as well, Russian energy has pretty much only two buyers now: India and China.“At this point, having choked Indian and Chinese refineries with so much oil in recent months, the Russians might have to wait out the next round of demand from these refiners, who, don’t forget, are re-exporting part of the Russian crude they are buying as finished fuel products,” John Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, told Investing.com.“So, India and China, besides their own consumption, need to find end-markets for the Russian oil they are buying as well. Yes, the rock-bottom Russian crude prices have been great for the profits of Indian and Chinese refiners. But now, they may have reached an inflection point for demand. Everyone’s competing for that same Asian market share. So, the Russian production cut here might be a forced situation, rather than a voluntary one.”Despite typically holding a negative bet against oil, Kilduff concedes that there could be some near-term pressure on energy consumers from the mind games played by Russia and the West.“From the consumers’ perspective, everything has to go perfectly for prices to continue staying flat to lower,” Kilduff said. “I liken it sort of to the New York City commuter traffic. Tons of volume goes through, you get to work pretty much fine every day. But you have one little accident, and now you’re looking at an hour-and-a-half to get across to the George Washington Bridge.”But all said, the G7 and the White House seem “pretty happy with the way their price cap has worked”, said Kilduff.“The Russians have been yelling from the rooftops that the cap is ‘stupid’. But the fact of the matter is it has succeeded in forcing them to sell to the lowest bidders in India and China. And they are hurting from that.”“Also, we are in a flat demand period ahead of the pick-up for summer. The market shouldn’t really be missing the Russian barrels right now.”Oil: Market Settlements and Activity Oil markets jumped as Russia hit back at the G7’s price caps by announcing production cuts and its own minimum price structure.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March did a final trade of $79.76 per barrel on Friday, after officially settling the session at $79.72, up $1.66, or 2.1%. The session high was $80.33, its loftiest since Jan. 30.For the week, the U.S. crude benchmark was up almost 9%, overwriting the previous week’s 7.5% plunge.London-traded Brent crude for March delivery had a final trade of $86.52 after finishing the regular session at $86.39, up $1.89, or 2.2%. The session peak was $86.90.Brent was up 8% on the week, erasing the previous week’s 7.5% decline.Oil plunged the previous week on the back of recession fears and uncertainty in U.S. interest rates' direction after bumper job and wage gains among Americans in January threatened to bump up inflation.During the week in review, oil rebounded on the premise that Chinese refiners would add exponentially to imports this month as the country returns from the long Lunar New Year break and into an environment free of COVID-19 restrictions which had previously hampered demand.However, Chinese import data supporting such a market run-up will likely not emerge for weeks. Latest available data showed the world’s largest crude importer bought 10.98 million bpd, or barrels per day, in January, down from December's 11.37M bpd and November's 11.42M bpd.Running counter to the just-ended week’s bullish sentiment in oil were large builds across the board in crude, gasoline and distillates in the Weekly Petroleum Status Report released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.Oil: Price OutlookWTI’s long consolidation within $72.25 support and $82.65 resistance creates a potential price range with a $10 sideplay, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.Though WTI’s daily chart shows the possibility of a bullish continuation, with the RSI, or Relative Strength Index, at 54 - positioned above neutrality of 50 - the confluence of the 50-Day EMA, or Exponential Moving Average, with the Daily Middle Bollinger Band calls for caution, Dixit said.“The market will prefer to monitor reaction to the 100-Day SMA (Simple Moving Average) of $81.08, followed by the horizontal resistance of $82.70 for any breakout and retest, before taking a broader bullish call.”Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The selloff in natural gas paused Friday, with the market posting its first weekly gain in eight, as bears in the market reassessed their positions after taking the heating fuel to 2-½ year lows in the previous session.The front-month March gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.580 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units on Friday, Investing.com data showed. The official settlement for the session was $2.514, up 6.9 cents, or 2.8%.For the week, the benchmark U.S. gas contract rose 4.3%, posting its first weekly gain since the week ended Dec. 9. Gas futures lost a cumulative 63% in seven weeks prior to that.On Thursday, March gas fell to $2.351, plumbing the lowest level for a front-month gas contract on the Henry Hub since Sept. 28, 2020, when the benchmark contract then went down to $2.02.An unusually warm start to the 2022/23 winter season has led to considerably less heating demand in the United States versus the norm, leaving more gas in storage than initially thought.At the close of last week, U.S. gas-in-storage stood at 2.366 tcf, or trillion cubic feet, up 10.9% from the year-ago level of 2.133 tcf, data from the EIA, or Energy Information Administration, showed.Utilities drew a higher-than-forecast 217 bcf, or billion cubic feet, from storage for heating and electricity generation last week, the EIA said.Analysts tracked by Investing.com had expected a draw of 195 bcf for the week ended Feb. 3, above the consumption of 151 bcf seen in the prior week to Jan. 27.“The bullishness of the withdrawal was driven by colder-than-normal temperatures, especially at the end of the reflective storage week,” analysts at Houston-based energy markets consultancy Gelber &amp; Associates said. “However, improving imbalances such as this aren’t significantly meaningful when they’re not accompanied by a supportive temperature outlook.”Responding to the warmth and lackluster storage draws, gas prices plunged from a 14-year high of $10 per mmBtu in August, reaching $7 in December and mid-$2 levels this week amid forecasts for bitter cold here and there.Natural gas: Price OutlookNatural gas’ RSI and Stochastics lack signs of an end to its bearish correction despite prevailing oversold conditions, said Dixit of SKCharting.“The $2 support remains intact for now,” said Dixit. “But if the $2.35 support is broken followed by a failed $2.18, then another headlong plunge will follow.”On the other hand, temporary optimism may reflect on some weak shorts being covered, he said. “In this aspect, if $2.68 is breached, followed by a breakout reaching $2.989, then the upside could stretch.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold for April delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,876.50 on Friday, after officially settling the session at $1,874.50, down $4 or 0.2%.For the week, however, April gold was up 0.6%.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled on Friday at $1,865.93, up $4.19, or 0.2%. For the week, the spot price was virtually flat.Gold: Price Outlook Going further into next week, spot gold’s sustainability above $1,856 will help it get some bounce towards $1,872 and $1,878 - which is a critical barrier to cross over to the further resistance zone of $1,886 and $1,893, said Dixit.“Sustainability below $1,856 will prompt a quick retest of $1,852, which is the acceleration point for a further drop to $1,842 and $1,832, with our own bearish target of $1,828, which coincides with the 38.2% Fibonacci level,” he added.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related Articles'The grass does not grow': In Chile's far south, the worst drought in 50 yearsOil prices rise over 2% on Russian plan to cut output]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 countries that produce the best athletes in the world.Sports has always fascinated people, from thousands of years ago to today. While fame has always been a given for athletes, with the level of fame depending on the popularity of the sport they've engaged in, the world of sports has changed significantly in the last century especially in terms of money. Half a century ago, only players at the very top of the game earned handsome salaries with most of the other players not earning more than the average person.15 countries that produce the best athletes in the worldNowadays, every corner of the world is inundated with sporting events including World Cups of different sports, with the most popular by far being the FIFA World Cup for football. The latest event was held in Qatar, which spend billions officially on ensuring that the World Cup was a massive success, which it did end up being. With the popularity of such sports, many sporting companies have become multi-billion dollar empires and provide sponsorships to top athletes to ensure that their name is out there front and center, with such companies including NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), which is worth nearly $200 billion currently and is the biggest sporting company in the world, Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UA) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU).These companies have realized the massive potential and returns that they can earn in the sporting world, with NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) arguably being the most successful company in this field. For many countries, their sporting market is an important part of their influence and an excellent source of revenue as well, as can seen in England where the England Premier League brings in revenues worth billions of pounds and is the highest-earning football league in the world. In the U.S., while most popular sports such as baseball, basketball and American football are popular in the country alone, they still bring in some of the highest revenue for any sports leagues in the world because of the American obsession with these sports. This is why some of the most valuable sports companies in the world are American sports teams. This is why many nations are investing heavily in discovering and supporting athletes, especially the countries that produce the best athletes in the world.Story continuesWhile many are calling out the sports world for exorbitant values and paying unbelievable salaries to athletes, changes seem unlikely considering the ever increasing demand for sports by spectators and the revenue that TV streaming rights provide to various sporting leagues. That's why many people consider sports clubs as investment opportunities. After all, Chelsea Football Club, one of the most successful football clubs in the world in the last two decades, was sold for £4.25 billion in 2022. 19 years ago, Roman Abramovich bought the club for a reported £140 million. That is a return of over 3,000% in 19 years. Sales of Liverpool Football Club and Manchester United plc (NYSE:MANU), the two most successful English football clubs in history, which are seeming more likely as time passes by, will also see huge returns for owners.To determine the countries that produce the best athletes, we couldn't focus on any one sport as many nations participate in different competitions and have superiority over the other in different competitions. This is why the Olympics were the best option for our ranking, as the Olympics have hundreds of events across all sports and athletics, showcasing the best from each country in various fields. The Olympics are interesting from an economical point of view as massive costs to host the Olympics continue to increase while benefits are uncertain, leaving countries with a massive loss which is why fewer countries are now bidding to host one of the most prestigious competitions in the world. According to a 2012 study by the University of Oxford, from 1976 to 2012, the average cost overrun for each Summer Olympics is around 252%. Despite this, over 250 companies advertise in the Olympics even though companies which aren't official partner of the Olympics aren't even allowed to use the term ""Olympics"".  We obtained data for the last 3 Olympic events, and combined each country's haul in gold, silver and bronze medals, assigning 50% weightage to each country's ranking for total gold medals, 30% weightage to each country's ranking for total silver medals, and 20% weightage to each country's ranking for total bronze medals. So, without further, ado, let's take a look at the athletic nations, starting with:15. SpainTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 14Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 22Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 18Spain has ensured that it is counted among the best sporting countries in the world through meticulous planning and execution.

58,caae09da-85cc-3382-b1ae-fde744eee8c9,LMT,2023-02-12,The 7 Safest Stocks You Can Buy in February 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-safest-stocks-buy-february-160328041.html,1675872208,STORY,"['UNH', 'NEE-PR', 'LMT', 'PEP', 'PG', 'HSY', 'KO']","[With the economy and the stock market not fully out of the woods, my suggestion is to focus on the safest stocks at the moment. With the most recent statements from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggesting that interest rates will keep rising, and that a “Fed pivot” isn’t just around the corner, the overall market’s strong performance over the past month could give way to another broad market sell-off.That in mind, now is the time to cycle back into safe stocks. Offering lower volatility, steady dividends, and the potential for gradual appreciation, these seven safest stocks could also receive a short-term lift, if today’s “risk-on” investors seek safer harbors.HSYHershey$236.29LMTLockheed Martin$469.64NEENextEra Energy$75.96PEPPepsiCo$170.78PGProcter &amp; Gamble$139.21PMPhilip Morris$101.56UNHUnitedHealth$480.89InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHershey (HSY)Source: ShutterstockShares of Hershey (NYSE:HSY) have continued to perform strongly. Shares stayed in the green during 2022, as HSY’s underlying business continued to “crush it,” despite challenges such as inflationary pressures. So far in 2023, HSY stock has continued to perform well, even as investors opt for the riskiest stocks rather than the safest stocks. However, if sentiment soon changes again, Hershey may not necessarily join in on the sell-off.  In fact, if the company continues reporting strong earnings growth, as it did in its latest quarterly results, shares could keep climbing higher.Besides appreciation potential, and very low volatility (HSY’s beta, or volatility compared to the overall market is 0.35). This stock also provides investors with a steady, growing dividend (1.71% forward yield). The company has raised its payout by an average of 8.74% annually over the past five years.Lockheed Martin (LMT)An F-16 and an F-35 model at the background, at the Lockheed Martin exhibition stand in Thessaloniki International Fair.Source: Giannis Papanikos / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) isn’t just a defense stock, it’s a defensive stock as well. With the recession-resistant nature of its business, it’s a high quality stock to buy and hold in all markets. While shares initially pulled back at the start of 2023, shares in this low-beta (0.68) stock are bouncing back.Story continuesTo some extent, this LMT stock rebound may be happening on the heels of a recent analyst double-upgrade. On Feb. 6, Credit Suisse’s Scott Deuschle raised his rating on LMT from “underperform” to “outperform,” basing his decision to upgrade on factors such as the defense contractor’s rising book-to-bill ratio, a sign of growth re-acceleration.Shares could potentially move higher in the coming year, in tandem with this expected earnings growth. This safe stock also offers investors steady returns, via its 2.56% dividend. LMT has a 20-year track record of dividend growth.NextEra Energy (NEE)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockIt’s no secret that many of the safest stocks are utilities stocks. Yet among scores of choices, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) may be your best bet. Yes, NEE’s beta (0.44) is on par with most utility stocks in the sector. Shares in this Florida-based electric power company also sell at a valuation premium to other major names in the sector.So then, what exactly makes NEE stock a standout among utilities? That would be its high exposure to the renewable energy megatrend. As InvestorPlace’s Josh Enomoto argued last month, NEE’s clean energy business will keep driving growth, which explains why the stock is a favorite among sell-side analysts.In turn, continued earnings growth likely means continued dividend growth. While offering a lower yield (2.25%) than peers, NEE has raised its payout by an average of 11.6% annually over the past five years.PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockThe consumer staples sector is another area chock full of safe stocks. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is one to consider adding as a safe harbor play. Sure, you may be thinking, why PEP rather than Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock?Yes, PEP stock and KO stock are similar in terms of their main business (soft drink), as well as stock-related metrics like beta (0.57 for PEP, 0.56 for KO) and valuation (mid-20s earnings multiple for both). Still, something else may give PEP the edge in this “cola stock war.”PEP and KO are each dividend kings, and KO does sport a slightly higher yield (2.93%, versus PEP’s 2.68%). However, raising its payout by an average of 7.4% over the past five years, versus an average of 3.53% for Coca-Cola, a higher level of dividend growth may enable PEP to outperform its longstanding rival going forward.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comProcter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a blue chip stock straight out of central casting. A more than century-old business, shares in this household products powerhouse have rewarded investors for generations, with steady dividends and growth.Even today, owning PG stock can provide your portfolio with solid returns. Investors seeking safety should appreciate its super-low beta of 0.4. Although shares may seem pricey, at around 24.5 times earnings, PG is likely to maintain this valuation, as it continues to consistently grow earnings.Current sell-side estimates call for earnings growth of around 8.2% next fiscal year (ending June 2024), and 9% in FY 2025. Add in PG’s 2.58% dividend, which has increased in each of the past 66 years, and it’s clear that Procter &amp; Gamble shares are in a strong position to provide investors with satisfactory returns, with much lower volatility than the overall stock market.Philip Morris (PM)packs of cigarettes in convenience store rackSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.comAmong top tobacco stocks, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) could be the safest in the bunch. Although it trades at a higher valuation, and a slightly higher beta than, say, its former parent company Altria Group (NYSE:MO), the company’s greater level of success so far with going “smoke free” may give its shares an extra degree of safety.As I argued recently, PM’s IQOS heated tobacco product, plus its recent purchase of smokeless tobacco and nicotine products maker Swedish Match, give it far greater exposure to growing segments of the tobacco industry. This could outweigh any possible declines in its legacy cigarette business, if the smoking rate keeps dropping.In addition to greater growth potential, PM stock also offers investors a solid dividend (forward yield of 4.97%). This dividend has grown steadily, increasing by an average of 3.62% annually over the past five years.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)UNH Stock Have Four More YearsSource: ShutterstockSelling off recently, on news of a lower-than-expected increase in Medicare Advantage payments this year, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) may not be acting like a safe stock right now.However, when looking on a longer timeframe, UNH stock remains less volatile than the overall stock market, with a beta of 0.69. This provider of health insurance and related services is not only still a safe stock. UnitedHealth Group remains a high-quality growth stock as well.Analyst forecasts continue to call for UNH to grow its earnings by double-digits over the next two years. Chances are that achieving this will result in a similarly-sized move higher for shares. Along with earnings growth, UNH offers investors the opportunity for dividend growth as well. While its current payout may seem low (1.39%), UnitedHealth has raised its dividend by an average of 17.4% annually over the past five years.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel held MO.

If you want to see more set-it-and-forget-it stocks to buy according to financial media, go directly to 5 Set-It-and-Forget-It Stocks to Buy According to Financial Media.Some stocks of leading companies are forever stocks in the eyes of many in the financial media.Those set-it-and-forget-it stocks have substantial scale and are very well known.They have been around for a while and they very likely will be around for a long time in the future too.Some of the leading companies rank among America's leading banks and thus are very important in terms of the American economy and the future of American growth. If America does well and those leading banks maintain their market share, those leading banks will likely do well in the long term.Some of the leading companies are what the financial media regards as 'Big Tech'. Those companies are huge profitable companies with substantial resources.Many of those big tech companies are also leaders in AI since they are the ones with the computing power, data, and financial resources.Companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are currently in an AI war, for instance. Late last year, OpenAI launched its ChatGPT AI chatbot which has offered substantial utility to many users even if it makes mistakes. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) previously invested $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019 and the company agreed to invest another $10 billion in 2023.Furthermore, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is planning to incorporate ChatGPT into Bing to potentially gain market share from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google.In response, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google is planning on launching multiple AI products this year, including its own AI search tool, Bard. Although Bard also makes mistakes, both will improve over time as the technology advances.Story continuesGiven its leading market share in cloud computing, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) likely will help power the computer processing of many AI applications in the future. Companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have invested substantial amounts into AI technologies and will likely have new AI incorporated products and services of their own in the future as well.Some other leading companies that the financial media likes are leading consumer staple conglomerates such as The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) that have long histories of increasing their annual dividends through multiple recessions.While the set-it-and-forget-it leading companies in the market have compelling qualities in the long term, they still have downside if the economy worsens or if their results do not meet expectations. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.AmazonPhoto by Bryan Angelo on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 10 Set-It-and-Forget-It Stocks to Buy According to Financial Media, we selected the stocks that have been highly regarded by the financial media as stocks that could do well in the long term.For those of you interested, check out 15 Stocks That Have Increased Their Dividends for Over 25 Years.10 Set-It-and-Forget-It Stocks to Buy According to Financial Media10. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $125.73 billionAlthough it isn't one of the big four biggest American banks, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is Wall Street's most prestigious investment bank. As a result, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is viewed by many in the financial media as the leading bank to the world's rich and powerful. Being a leading bank to the rich and powerful can be a pretty good business to be in the long term even if Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) employees are very well paid. In the last ten years, the stock of the leading investment bank has more than doubled. As of February 10, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) also has a dividend yield of 2.69%.Alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a set-it-and-forget-it stock to buy according to financial media.9. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $285.44 billionBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is one of the 'big four' American banks with a market capitalization of $285.44 billion, ranking #9 on our list of 10 Set-It-and-Forget-It Stocks to Buy According to Financial Media. Given its scale and importance in the financial sector, many in the financial media view big banks like Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) as systematically important. Although being systemically important doesn't mean good returns, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) nevertheless does also have substantial normalized earnings power and management is returning capital back to shareholders with a dividend yield of 2.47% as of 2/10. On average, analysts expect the bank to earn $3.12 per share for 2022, $3.48 per share in 2023, $3.76 per share in 2024, and $4.23 per share in 2025.8. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $326.18 billionThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is viewed by many in the financial media as a Dividend Aristocrat or a stock that has raised its annual dividend for at least 25 straight years. In terms of its dividend, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has actually raised its annual dividend for 67 straight years, meaning the leading consumer staple has been financially strong enough to increase payouts through multiple recessions. Although higher inflation has been a headwind for demand for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) recently, the company has long term earnings power if inflation normalizes.7. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $413.70 billionJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is regarded by many in the financial media as one of America's best big banks given the company's strong profitability and arguably great CEO in Jamie Dimon. Like Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a systemically important institution, giving it more importance in the media. Although an economic slowdown or recession could decrease earnings in the near term, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has long term EPS growth potential given its earnings power and eventual stock buybacks which could begin as early as this year.6. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $423.94 billionJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is viewed by the financial media as another leading Dividend Aristocrat that has increased its annual dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. In Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s case, the healthcare conglomerate has actually increased its annual dividend 61 consecutive years. Although shares of the stock are down 5.45% in the last year, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) increased its full year 2022 sales by 1.3% year over year to $94.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 3.6% year over year to $10.15 per share. Shares currently trade for a forward P/E of 14.84, which could be attractive in terms of the long term if the conglomerate maintains its market share.Like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are set-it-and-forget-it stocks to buy according to financial media.

Though investors shouldn’t ignore the relatively boring option of dividend stocks to buy. True, companies that provide reliable passive income don’t generate much excitement. However, with so many variables ahead of the markets, a dull but dependable route may be more prudent.For this list of dividend stocks to buy, every company features a payout ratio – or the proportion of earnings a company pays its shareholders via dividends – below 70%. As well, each enterprise carries a consensus rating among analysts of moderate buy or its equivalent. That way, prospective investors can also enjoy capital gains potential.TXNTexas Instruments$176.50UPSUnited Parcel Service$186.36DOXAmdocs$95.21TSCOTractor Supply$231.24SNASnap-on$251.20JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$163.61CSCOCisco$46.96InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTexas Instrument (TXN)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comOne of the top technology firms in the nation, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally. So far, TXN has avoided the wild volatility that impacted its peers. In the trailing year, shares gained over 6%. In contrast, the Nasdaq Composite index dropped nearly 15% during the same period.Currently, Texas Instruments carries a forward yield of 2.7%. This ranks conspicuously above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Further, its payout ratio pings at 59.28%. As well, the company commands 19 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Therefore, it’s unlikely that management will give up this trend without a fight.Financially, Texas Instruments features a stable balance sheet (an Altman Z-Score of 12.85) and excellent profitability margins. These attributes may have contributed to Wall Street analysts rating TXN as a consensus moderate buy. Further, TipRanks notes that hedge fund sentiment rates as “positive.” Therefore, it offers a solid choice among dividend stocks to buy.Story continuesUnited Parcel Service (UPS)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA stalwart in the shipping and receiving industry, United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) represents a critical cog in the broader supply chain management complex. Admittedly, though, circumstances have been challenging for UPS amid 2022’s spike in inflation. However, the situation appears to be turning around, with shares gaining over 7% since the January opener.Presently, UPS carries a forward yield of 3.44%. This rates better than the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. Notably, the company’s payout ratio is 52.73%. In addition, UPS features 14 years of consecutive dividend increases.Despite wider challenges, UPS commands a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.4%, outpacing 75% of the competition. Also, its net margin stands at 11.51%, beating over 68% of its rivals.Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg UPS as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target is $194.94, implying potential upside of 3.53%. While not particularly exciting, UPS ranks among the dividend stocks to buy this year.Amdocs (DOX)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockA multinational software firm, Amdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) specializes in software and services for communications, media and financial services providers and digital enterprises. Contrary to many of its tech peers, Amdocs performed very well in 2022. For instance, in the trailing 365 days, DOX gained nearly 22%. It’s still up almost 4% since the January opener.At the moment, DOX carries a forward yield of 1.83%. Though not the highest yield, it still rates better than the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, Amdocs features a low payout ratio of 26.75%, meaning investors can depend on it for reliable passive income. Plus, the company enjoys 10 consecutive years of dividend increases.Financially, DOX might attract investors for its value proposition. The market prices shares at a forward multiple of 16.77. As a discount to forward earnings, Amdocs ranks better than 72%.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg DOX as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $99, implying 4% upside potential. Combined with its strong market performance, DOX represents one of the dividend stocks to buy.Tractor Supply (TSCO)7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right NowSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee, Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) is an American retail chain of stores that sells products for various purposes. These include home improvement, agriculture, lawn and garden maintenance, livestock, equine and pet care for recreational farmers and ranchers, pet owners, and landowners.Although a boring entry among dividend stocks to buy, Tractor did what it does best: keep the ship afloat. In the trailing year, shares gained nearly 5%. While not particularly impressive, it’s a heckuva lot better than falling into negative territory.Presently, Tractor Supply carries a forward yield of 1.58%. To be fair, this slips a bit below the consumer discretionary sector’s average yield of 1.89%. However, the payout ratio sits at 31.69%, making TSCO one of the more dependable dividend stocks to buy.Finally, Wall Street analysts assess TSCO as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target pings at $245.78, implying upside potential of almost 6%.Snap-on (SNA)dividend stocks: A calculator projecting the word ""DIVIDEND"" rests on a pile of gold and silver coins.Source: ShutterstockNot to be confused with the similar-sounding social media firm, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) is an American designer, manufacturer and marketer of high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry. These sectors included the automotive, heavy duty, equipment, marine, aviation and railroad industries.Though another boring behind-the-shadows example of dividend stocks to buy, SNA proves that boring can be profitable. In the trailing year, shares gained nearly 20% of equity value. Further, since the Jan. opener, SNA moved up 11%.At time of writing, Snap-on carries a forward yield of 2.55%. This rates higher than the consumer discretionary sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Further, the payout ratio sits at 36.65%, making it one of the reliable dividend stocks to buy. As well, Snap-on enjoys 13 years of consecutive dividend increases.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg SNA as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $281, implying upside potential of over 10%.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Source: ShutterstockFounded in 1886, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) represents an American icon. As a business enterprise, Johnson &amp; Johnson develops medical devices, pharmaceuticals and consumer packaged goods. However, JNJ hasn’t posted a great performance recently. In the trailing year, it fell nearly 5%. And since the January opener, JNJ faces a deficit of more than 8%.Nevertheless, this may open the door for contrarians to pick up one of the dividend stocks to buy on discount. Currently, the healthcare giant carries a forward yield of 2.77%. This ranks notably higher than the underlying sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Also, its payout ratio of 41.5% provides prospective investors with confidence. Lastly, regarding the passive income, it’s on a 61-year consecutive streak of dividend increases.Looking to Wall Street, analysts peg JNJ as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $186.11, implying upside potential of nearly 14%.Cisco Systems (CSCO)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in San Jose, California, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a digital communications technology conglomerate. Per its website, Cisco develops, manufactures, and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment and other high-technology services and products. However, CSCO hasn’t been a great performer last year. In the trailing 365 days, CSCO lost almost 14% of equity value.Even in the year so far, Cisco presently posts unimpressive numbers, slipping a few basis points below parity. Nonetheless, for bargain hunters, CSCO may be one of the best dividend stocks to buy. Currently, the company offers a forward yield of 3.18%. In contrast, the tech sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%. Moreover, the payout ratio offers confidence, coming in just under 40%. Lastly regarding dividends, it features 12 years of consecutive payout increases.Right now, analysts peg CSCO as a consensus moderate buy. Additionally, their average price target stands at $54.70, implying upside potential of over 14%.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:ROK) Before Its Ex-Dividend?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/income-investors-look-rockwell-automation-121528873.html,1676204128,STORY,['ROK'],"[Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase Rockwell Automation's shares before the 17th of February in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 10th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.18 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$4.72 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Rockwell Automation has a trailing yield of 1.7% on the current share price of $285.18. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Rockwell Automation's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. View our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately Rockwell Automation's payout ratio is modest, at just 49% of profit. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out more than half (68%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see Rockwell Automation earnings per share are up 7.8% per annum over the last five years. Decent historical earnings per share growth suggests Rockwell Automation has been effectively growing value for shareholders. However, it's now paying out more than half its earnings as dividends. If management lifts the payout ratio further, we'd take this as a tacit signal that the company's growth prospects are slowing.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Rockwell Automation has lifted its dividend by approximately 11% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Rockwell Automation for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share growth has been modest, and it's interesting that Rockwell Automation is paying out less than half of its earnings and more than half its cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends. While it does have some good things going for it, we're a bit ambivalent and it would take more to convince us of Rockwell Automation's dividend merits.In light of that, while Rockwell Automation has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example - Rockwell Automation has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

It also wants planes for aircraft carriers to balance China's growing power in the Indian Ocean.As the country prepares to host the Aero India show in Bengaluru from Monday, its airlines are expanding, with Air India expected to announce a potentially record deal to buy nearly 500 jets from Airbus SE and Boeing Co, worth more than $100 billion at list prices.IndiGo, the country's biggest carrier and a top Airbus client, could be next, with aviation consultant CAPA India predicting it will make a blockbuster order of a similar scale as Air India's.Indian carriers may buy 1,500 to 1,700 aircraft in coming years, CAPA said, including Air India and IndiGo.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to open the air show, which runs through Friday. It will be military-dominated but also feature India's efforts to accommodate a domestic travel boom and rebuild its brand abroad.Modi has made ""Make-in-India"" a centrepiece of his economic policy, insisting that manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin Corp, Boeing and Airbus share technology or make more than parts in the country.His government's push to expand the world's fifth-largest economy to $5 trillion by 2026 from $3.2 trillion in 2021 could mean more industrial supply deals.MILITARY, COMMERCIAL COMPETITION""The days of foreign companies selling directly to India are over,"" a defence industry source told Reuters. ""The narrative has moved as the Modi government wants Indian companies to manufacture in partnership with global firms.""Story continuesThe push for transfer of high technology and domestic manufacturing signals Modi's ambition to share the stage with military superpowers like the United States, Russia and China.At the same time, airlines like Air India are seeking to go head-on with rivals like Emirates Airline for a bigger share of international passenger flow. But many analysts warn recapturing traffic from established Gulf hubs will face tough competition.With manufacturers lining up for a slice of the multi-billion-dollar opportunity and the chance to partner with a rising power, Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC has said it was ready to work with India on developing combat-aircraft engine technologies.New Delhi is trying to reduce its traditional dependence on Russia, turning to the United States, France and Israel for equipment and pushing its own Tejas light combat plane.The U.S. delegation will be the largest in the air show's 27-year history, said the embassy in New Delhi. ""As India modernises its defence capabilities, certainly we want to be the partner of choice.""India's pressing military air need is to shore up its fighter squadrons, which have fallen to 31 from the approved 42 as political and bureaucratic hurdles and lack of funds delay purchases. A $20-billion proposal to buy 114 multi-role fighter aircraft has been pending for five years, brought into sharp focus by tensions with China and Pakistan.The biggest military aircraft makers want in on such a deal, with attention on French Dassault Aviation SA's Rafale, Saab AB's JAS-39 Gripen, Boeing's F-15EX and F/A-18 Super Hornet, and Lockheed Martin's F-21 - an upgraded version of the F-16 unveiled at the India show in 2019.

If you want to see more most profitable cheap stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Cheap Stocks to Buy.Cheap stocks are stocks that trade below what many people think they're really worth. Given different people have different opinions on what's cheap, cheap stocks are subjective. Some people might think a stock is cheap but others may not.Nevertheless, some of the best cheap stocks in the long term are blue chip stocks with substantial competitive advantages trading for fair or below average valuations.Cheap stocks can trade for lower valuations for various reasons.Some companies like Meta Platforms, Inc.

If Bing gains substantial market share given new AI tools it will soon launch, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s earnings could decrease in the near term and the company will need to launch new services that will need to do well to preserve its growth.Other companies might be affected by macroeconomic headwinds. In 2022, inflation rose substantially and the Federal Reserve had to raise interest rates considerably as a result. With the substantially higher interest rates, U.S. Treasury yields have increased considerably, and the outflow of capital from the equity market into the Treasury market has weighed on some valuations.Story continuesAlthough inflation has recently eased from its highs late last year, many economists think the U.S. central bank might have to raise rates several more times this year to make sure that inflation has really peaked. If the Federal Reserve raises rates too much, there could be an economic slowdown or even a recession that might weigh on earnings.If economic conditions normalize in the long term, however, the valuations of the leading stocks could also potentially normalize assuming that they maintain their market shares and profitability.Similarly, if companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s metaverse project end up being very profitable, there's potential for upside.Every company is different and some companies might not do as well as expected even if they have a lot of competitive advantages.

Betting will also take center stage, with over 50 million people expected to wager billions on sites like DraftKings (DKNG), MGM (MGM) and more. Food prices will also dominate the night; while chicken wings and avocados are cheaper this year, beer prices are on the rise.Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith, Dave Briggs, Josh Schafer and Alexandra Canal take a look at the finances behind the big game.Key Video Takeaways.05:00 - DraftKings CEO Jason Robins11:45 - Governor Katie Hobbs, (D) Arizona18:00 - Philadelphia Eagles Defensive Tackle Ndamukong Suh30:00 - Halftime show expectations42:00 - the big business of Super Bowl ads49:00 - How stocks perform based on the winning team55:00 - Rising food costsVideo TranscriptDAVID BRIGGS: Hey, everybody, Dave and Seana.

What do you think?DAVID BRIGGS: I'm going red.SEANA SMITH: I'm going orange. I was going to go yellow. Reds a bold bet. I like it. We will see who the winner is.Story continues[MUSIC PLAYING]DAVID BRIGGS: Hey, everybody. Welcome into our Super Bowl LVII coverage. I'm Dave Briggs, alongside Seana Smith. Cannot wait for this game. We've got a lot coming your way over the next hour. I'm really excited for the game itself, but I want you to go first on what you're eyeing in the game, or outside the game.SEANA SMITH: Well, in the game-- I'm going to say an overall thing-- it's going to be the Eagles, my hometown team. I am very, very excited for them going for their second title in the last six years. Specific, Jalen Hurts, it's all about him. He's got to keep the momentum. I'm excited about that. Aside from the game, the halftime show. Apple is now going-- is the official sponsor of the show this year, taking over from Pepsi. Rihanna is back on the live music stage. I'm excited.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm just out of the loop on Rihanna. I'm sorry. I don't want to offend anybody. I just don't get it. But I know she's awesome. I'm excited because, look, I think the Eagles have a far superior roster. I do acknowledge that. But Andy Reid always has something interesting up his sleeve. Something you have never seen before, and Patrick Mahomes has that Harry-Potter-like wand. He has magic. I think they actually should be a 7 or an 8-point underdog. I think the Eagles are a much better team. But the Chiefs can really surprise you, but I'll be honest, what I'm really looking forward to is my only Super Bowl tradition, my wife's buffalo chicken dip. It's awesome. Like, that's all that matters for me on Super Bowl Sunday.SEANA SMITH: You're going to bring over the leftovers on Monday, then.DAVID BRIGGS: There won't be any, dude.SEANA SMITH: Well, maybe you should--DAVID BRIGGS: I'll be, like, scraping--SEANA SMITH: --leave a little bit--DAVID BRIGGS: --the bowl with my fingers when the chips run out.SEANA SMITH: I got to get the recipe after this show. All right, well, this might be the biggest Super Bowl yet for the gambling industry. Lots to look forward to this weekend. The American Gaming Association releasing its predictions for Super Bowl LVII, estimating that about 50 million Americans will bet roughly $16 billion on this year's game. That's more than double last year's total, but our own, Josh Schafer, has been looking further into this number, what it really means for the sportsbook operators. What do you got for us, Josh?JOSH SHAFER: That's right, Seana. So that's $16 billion number is, obviously, a massive number, but not all of that is going to go right to the sportsbook. So for starters, that number includes both bets placed legally and illegally. It's also an estimate. And if we take a look at last year's estimate, 7.61 billion translated to just $950 million of legal handle. That's according to the AGA's assessment of state data.So less than 15% of last year's estimation ended up as legal handle. Now, the total amount at legal books, and then if you have to think about how these sportsbooks make money, right? So you take that handle-- that legal handle, that $950 million and then you subtract what's known as the gross winning margin, or you multiply it by that gross winning margin, which is only 10% on average.Then when you multiply those, you end up only getting $95 million as the total legal handle-- or, sorry, the gross gaming revenue, which is what goes back to the sportsbooks. That's the number that ends up getting taxed, and that can be taxed, guys, at about an average of a 20% rate. So there are $95 million then taxed at 20%, it's just not quite as big as that $16 billion number we like to talk about all the time, but it is still a huge week, Dave. The stocks have been roaring headed into the Super Bowl. The three or four of the gambling stocks here over the last month, so it certainly is an exciting time.DAVID BRIGGS: You just took like an extra large pizza and boiled it down to one slice.JOSH SHAFER: But that slice could be delicious. That slice could be absolutely delicious.DAVID BRIGGS: And it's still a pretty solid slice. It's a New York-sized slice. But the game is not in New York. It's in Arizona. And that's the first time we've ever had a legal sports gambling state host a Super Bowl. What does that mean? What are the implications?JOSH SHAFER: Well, it means that people can bet well they're sitting in the stadium, right? And that's the biggest thing that we're going to be watching, and really what I want to point out here too is the tax rate. So Arizona taxes mobile betting at a 10% rate, and why I'm watching that number is because Arizona is probably going to have a higher handle this Sunday than they normally would. They're going to get a 10% rate on that. They're going to get a lot of state revenue, guys. And I'm curious how that leads moving forward. As we continue to see gambling grow, are more states going to want the Super Bowl to bring in a lot of gamblers, get people excited for the game and get more state revenue? Seems like a decent deal to me.DAVID BRIGGS: Where's the game next year? Vegas, baby. I mean--JOSH SHAFER: Not a bad place for gambling.DAVID BRIGGS: That seems like it'll work out well. Great stuff. 50. 50 million Americans expected to throw down $16 billion in bets on Super Bowl LVII. Let's dig into those numbers with DraftKings CEO, Jason Robins. Jason, good to see you, man. 33 states now legal. How big is this weekend for you guys compared to anything you've seen in the past? What are your expectations?JASON ROBINS: Oh, I mean, given the growth of the industry, this is almost certainly going to be our biggest Super Bowl ever. And hard to know, it's always-- we always have predictions around the office going in because it's such a fun time. But one thing we know is it's going to be a big day. We know it's going to be our biggest customer acquisition day, and we're all excited to see the results. By the way, I heard in the other set, you're betting on red for the Gatorade? Is that-- I hear that right?DAVID BRIGGS: Do I have the wrong color, bro?JASON ROBINS: Listen, I don't know, but somebody told me, and you should verify this because I did not verify myself that there has never been red Gatorade poured on the winning coach in the Super Bowl. So maybe this is the year, but just a little hot take for you to check out. And I could be totally wrong on that. It was something somebody told me, but you should check that out.DAVID BRIGGS: Betting scoop. I appreciate that, buddy. That is solid. I had my eye on like an Eagles Green, so I'm going to have to look at the odds here on DraftKings.SEANA SMITH: Jeez, I think I picked orange. Hopefully, my odds are a little bit better than what Dave is facing right now, but, Jason, you talk about the popularity of sports betting, certainly we have seen massive growth over the last several years. With the Super Bowl in Arizona, like we're talking about, the first state with statewide legalized sports gambling here, in terms of the number of users that you are expected to add, can you put a number on that?JASON ROBINS: We can. I mean, one, we actually have earnings next week. So I've got to be careful about saying anything like that, but, also, it's just tough to predict. I mean, so much comes in towards the end and the last day, and even in the last hours. And so hard to say, but I know that we think it'll be our biggest day ever, and that's been the case for the last three Superbowls, or last-- excuse me, four Super Bowls since legalized sports betting as well.JOSH SHAFER: Jason, I'm curious what you're seeing out of the live betting space. Obviously, I think it being in Arizona probably helps, right? With people being excited while they're at the game, to probably bet during the game while they're sitting in the stands. I know often we talk about that Europe number, right? Maybe getting to 70, 75% of all bets, or all handle being in that live betting space. Do you think we eventually get there? Or is that where things are headed? How have you sort of seen those trends?JASON ROBINS: You know, live betting continues to increase. I think whether we get there or higher or a little lower, I don't know. But I think it's going to continue to grow. I think more and more people are starting to see that you can make bets during the game. And that doesn't just mean things like what's the next play or something like that.Some people decide, hey, maybe at halftime, they want to double down on the bet they made before the game. Or maybe they want to switch sides or something like that. So lots of options throughout the game.We also, you mentioned Arizona. This is the first year since legalized sports betting outside of Nevada that you will have a Super Bowl in a state with legal sports betting. So really excited to see how that plays out. I agree with you. I think it's going to have a tremendous halo effect on the state.Because not only the people at the game, but all the people that are in Arizona that know that the Super Bowl is here and are paying attention. And we're doing everything we can to let all the people coming in from out of town know, hey, while you're here, you can make a bet. And I think you're going to see a lot of fans take us up on that.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, that is interesting. And next year it'll be the second in a row because it's in Vegas.JASON ROBINS: Yeah.DAVID BRIGGS: But in terms of the big picture, certainly all the momentum is on the side of the sports gambling. But those three big states are out there-- California, Texas, and Florida. What went wrong in California? And when do you see any of those three states turning legal?JASON ROBINS: Well, I mean, California, it's pretty simple. We had over $200 million in opposition spent against us. I think, you know, eight times maybe is close to that, the next biggest opposition spend of any campaign. So, you know, we were literally attacked with a barrage of ads, many of them pushing false narratives. But not much you can do in a short cycle. And people hear what they hear. And, unfortunately, I think some incorrect facts got out there.So, you know, I think, first, we're going to try to work with the tribes. Obviously, that's a much easier path than trying to fight them. And nobody wants that. We actually had in our ballot initiative revenue going to the tribes. We had tethering to the tribes. Everything had to flow through the tribes.And, you know, we're going to hopefully get another year, another, I guess, two years from now. Well, one year from now, we're going to be able to potentially take another shot. And I think we have to learn from last time and educate a little better and be smarter about it. So we'll see on that.One Texas is in play this year. I think there's a live bill that has a decent shot of advancing. We'll have to see. Obviously, a lot to play out in the legislative session. So, you know, I think those are the two biggest states.Florida, you mentioned also, you know, tribal state, so has some of the same dynamics. But in that case, it's really one tribe, the Seminoles. So, you know, trying to figure out a way to collaborate with them, I think.And, hopefully, that's where the industry is going. There's just more collaboration. And everybody realizes that a rising tide will lift all ships. And, you know, I think that's something that we're seeing slowly but surely to try and move towards. But still a lot of work to do there, and especially in those big states. They're big prizes. So there's obviously going to be a lot of interest and a lot of stakeholders.SEANA SMITH: All right, Jason Robins, CEO of DraftKings, always great to have you. Thanks so much. Have fun this weekend.JASON ROBINS: OK, thank you so much.SEANA SMITH: All right, well, Arizona, like we've been talking about, is hosting this year's Super Bowl. Hundreds of thousands of fans are already there, getting ready for the big game. Yahoo Finance contributor Kevin Cirilli is doing just that. And Kevin, I know you spoke with a lot of key voices down there. I've got to say, I'm very jealous. I wish I was in your shoes right now. Give us a lay of the land. What's it like down there in Arizona right now?KEVIN CIRILLI: Well, when the plane landed at Sky Harbor, I thought I was in Ireland. Because all I kept seeing was green. There are literally-- I mean, there's-- I've seen like maybe one or two Chiefs fans. But, I mean, it's all Eagles fans everywhere. So, I mean, I feel like I'm at home here in sunny Scottsdale. Camelback Mountain behind me, if you know the area.Look, I was at the Phoenix Open, the Waste Management Open earlier this week, which has really become a business private partnership, a public private partnership, really a hub that Jack Selby, who's the managing director for Peter Thiel's family, and he's got his own venture capitalist investing $110 million here in the state. He started this thing. And it's really gone global.And one of the folks he was able to get out there was governor Katie Hobbs, the newly-elected Democratic governor of Arizona. And she noted the economic impact that the Super Bowl, that the Phoenix Open that that's having on this state. Take a listen to what she told me on the 17th hole.KATIE HOBBS: It is huge. It is huge. We have 160,000 workers in our tourism and hospitality industry that are ready to welcome the visitors that are already here, making sure they have a great experience. That gets return visits. And that helps our economy. The last time we had the Super Bowl in 2015, the economic impact was over $700 million.- $700 million?KATIE HOBBS: Yeah, yeah With over 100,000 visitors. So we're expecting to top that. And the lasting benefits for our economy, because we've become sort of-- we have a great track record with these kind of big events. And it's just going to attract more of them in the future.KEVIN CIRILLI: So when you look at the numbers, last year alone, $24.2 billion worth in the sports and tourism industry contributed to Arizona's GDP. They're expecting that the Super Bowl alone will increase that number to more than $1,000,000,000. So you could see a five percentage increase in that regard.But a lot of economic development here outside of sports. The semiconductor chip manufacturing that's being conducted here in the state, something that President Biden talked about in his State of the Union address earlier this week. Remember, Intel, TSMC building their fab factories down here.The governor is excited about that. Jack Selby is excited about that. A lot happening. They're trying to give Austin a run for their money.DAVID BRIGGS: All right, quickly, I know you're a big fan. I know you think Philly is going to win. Give me a score. And what's the particular edge you think that Philly has over KC?KEVIN CIRILLI: All right, well, one, the fans. That's the edge, clearly. Two, they're going to essentially be playing in a home stadium. And, three, I'm thinking it'll be 27-24, Birds. I do think it's going to be a nail-biter. I heard you compare-- I heard you compare the Chiefs to Hogwarts. And I got to say, that is not the case, OK? Like the Eagles are Gryffindor, let me just put it that way. How's that?DAVID BRIGGS: First off, it was Patrick Mahomes is Harry Potter, has a bit of wizardry to him. Let's get it straight, Cirilli, all right?KEVIN CIRILLI: OK.DAVID BRIGGS: Good luck, brother. Enjoy it out there, OK?KEVIN CIRILLI: I appreciate it. That's awesome, awesome. I'll talk to you guys later. Thank you for having me.DAVID BRIGGS: All right, we're going to be taking a look now at some prop bets through the hour. Our Josh Schafer, he is our resident junky gambler. And he's going to break it down for us. I need some prop action. So what do you got?JOSH SCHAFER: We've got some fun ones here for you guys. We're going to start with Gatorade, which sounds like it's a hot topic for you two. And--DAVID BRIGGS: Yep.SEANA SMITH: Yes.JOSH SCHAFER: --I'm not going to lie, where did we pick? Who had red? Someone had red, right?DAVID BRIGGS: I took red.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, all right, you're with 8% of the handle here. That's plus 450 odds, Dave. So what you're looking at is where people are betting. So the most bet on Gatorade is yellow. 40% of the money is on yellow. And then you've got 20% of the money on blue, 20% of the money on orange.SEANA SMITH: That's my pick.JOSH SCHAFER: My pick-- I've got to step out of the way here-- is purple. Because I think Riptide Rush is the best Gatorade. And that's simply all I'm picking off of. There is some fun stats, if you guys want to go deep into this, right? Orange is the most picked. That's probably why Seana picked it. It's come up the most times since 2001.SEANA SMITH: I did my research.JOSH SCHAFER: And then yellow is also very popular right now among Eagles fans. So yellow was poured on Doug Pederson at the NFC Championship and the Super Bowl the last time the Eagles won. And Nick Sirianni two weeks ago had yellow Gatorade poured on him.DAVID BRIGGS: Oh.SEANA SMITH: I love that flavor.JOSH SCHAFER: We like yellow.DAVID BRIGGS: That's a solid scoop. There are some of these colors, Josh, that are a little bit in between, that there's like a greenish-blue. You know what I mean, that greenish-blue Gatorade.JOSH SCHAFER: Green-blue, well, we've got yellow-green.DAVID BRIGGS: Right, I'm looking at it--JOSH SCHAFER: We're going to have to call back up Jason Robins--SEANA SMITH: You're the one that's disputing the color of Gatorade.JOSH SCHAFER: --and dispute what color you had. Because yellow-green is the only unclear one here. Then you've got red-pink.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, that would be pretty clear.DAVID BRIGGS: But like, pink?SEANA SMITH: That's going to be a tough one to argue with.DAVID BRIGGS: Is that even a Gatorade?JOSH SCHAFER: That's why I'm going with purple. It's simple.DAVID BRIGGS: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: I don't know if it's ever happened.SEANA SMITH: I'm going orange.JOSH SCHAFER: But I'm going purple.DAVID BRIGGS: OK, all right, that's a good job.JOSH SCHAFER: All right, coming up, Eagles defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh who competes for his second Super Bowl ring on Sunday also boasts an impressive investing portfolio. He'll tell us more about it next.[MUSIC PLAYING]No shortage of storylines ahead of Super Bowl LVII. We've got the first ever meeting of Black quarterbacks, the first ever meeting between two brothers in Jason and Travis Kelce, and the third Super Bowl with three different teams from one of the greatest defensive linemen in NFL history. I'm talking about Eagles five time all-pro defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, who joins us now.Great of you to find the time during this busy week, my friend. So three teams, three Super Bowls. What makes this experience different for you?NDAMUKONG SUH: The experience each and every single year is different. No matter what team you're with, whether you've been with the team for 10 years or two years, every year is different. Every team is different and always going to continue to be that way, unfortunately. But that's part of the business. But it's exciting to have an opportunity to get back to the Super Bowl and have another opportunity to win.SEANA SMITH: Ndamukong, it's great to see. You're playing for my hometown team. So I am clearly rooting for you on Sunday. You're playing this time for Nick Sirianni. Who's not that much older than you. From your time with the Eagles this year, what have you learned from him just in terms of the leadership and his success that he's clearly having so early in his career?NDAMUKONG SUH: He's a great coach. Having played against him last year in the playoffs when I was down in Tampa and we took care of business that first round, but he's a great coach. He understands all the different nuances, has an opportunity to be a leader on the offensive side of the ball, but also understand the defense and how we want to particularly rush up front and get off the quarterbacks. And I think from the standpoint of his leadership, he just understands, it's all about keeping detail-oriented process, focusing on the things that count the most when it comes to situational ball and going from there.DAVID BRIGGS: I mentioned that quarterback match-up, which is so intriguing. Tell me about the key to defending, to stopping, to containing Patrick Mahomes. And if I could ask a double, you shut down your quarterback, Jalen Hurts, this time last year a bit earlier. How much has he grown in that one year?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, we'll start first with Patrick Mahomes. He's a great talent, very, very elusive, to say the least. I've been going against him in years past, but most notably in the 2021 Super Bowl that I won with Tampa. He's just always extending the play. And that's something that as a defensive line that we have to focus on.There's no end in rushing. Until that ball either incomplete or you got a sack and he's fully, fully down, you've got to keep rushing. Because he loves to extend plays and make things happen and getting balls to the receivers, especially 87.And so when it comes to transitioning to Jalen, I think Jalen has grown tremendously. He's found a way to not only hurt people with his feet, but as well as his arm. And I think the GM Howard did an amazing job defining great talent around him and adding some pieces, for example, AJ Brown.DAVID BRIGGS: Boy, has he come a long way in just one year. Speaking of, you've come a long way over your career. You were once voted the dirtiest player in the league. You've been fined more than $600,000. But, recently, you played peacekeeper against the Niners. How do you think you have evolved over these 13 years? Or were you just misunderstood?NDAMUKONG SUH: I've always said it, if people ever take the time to really get to understand me and get to know me and really truthfully be unbiased when it comes to my personality and my character, they wouldn't have made those votes and they wouldn't have had that particular characteristics around me as a person. I've always been some sort of a peacekeeper or, if you want to call it that. But I know Trent well. So when he saw me getting in front of him and it wasn't about anything other than the game is pretty much over, let's move on, let's get to the next play and go from there.SEANA SMITH: You've clearly had a lot of success on the field. You've also had a lot of success off the field as well. I know you have invested in over 30 companies. One of your mentors is actually Warren Buffett. Talk to us just about that relationship, the biggest lessons that you've learned from him, and how that's really helped shape your investment career.NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think the biggest thing that I've learned from Mr. Buffett is just being able to have good people around you. And as you see, he has multiple companies. He trusts those folks and puts them in places and empowers them.And that's something that I like to do, not only in my foundation with my family and my wife, but also being to be able to empower people, whether it's in the real estate realm, having a development company, being able to build multifamily housing, being able to take care of other people and finding ways to find affordable housing for folks that should be afforded to them at all times. And it's tough in this day and age, especially going through the pandemic. You saw that it's probably its worst. And so hopefully we can continue as a collective to get better in that space. But when it comes to investing, I just have fun with it.I love learning. I love being able to sit down with folks. I actually sat down with one of our owners yesterday to have a great conversation of how he built his company with KKR. I've done some work with them. And so it's a fun opportunity for me to just be able to build relationships and learn from folks and then being able to be involved and be hands-on.SEANA SMITH: You mentioned your involvement in real estate there a moment ago, some of your initiatives, how you're looking to tackle housing affordability. From your perspective from your involvement in the space over the last several years, what more do you think needs to be done? And how do we better address this issue?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think it's-- I think one of the key things that we could do, especially when it comes to affordable housing, is kind of take it out of the city and state's hands. If we privatize it in a manner and incentivize private real estate people, it'd be great. Because if you really look at it and break down the numbers from a perspective how I look at it, it's one of the most expensive housing just because of the rules and regulations that go into it, which I understand and respect. But if we potentially looked at it being privatized, I think would be a lot faster and to be able to be something that is afforded to people a lot quicker.SEANA SMITH: You're involved in over 30 companies here. I think a lot of people at home are asking, how do you have the time for this? How involved are you with each investment?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think I'm very, very involved in every single day, finding time to be able to do it. But it's really being able to compartmentalize things. Obviously, playing football pulls me away from it a fair amount. But I've been at it for 13 years. I understand how I need to study, how I need to focus, even going into a very important week like this week with the Super Bowl, I can still look at things. I probably won't as detailed and push it off just a week or two.But, for me, I still look at opportunities and find time to do it. And I think one of the greatest things that helps you keep you sharp. Because if you get overloaded in one particular thing, then you don't have the capacity to go and look at other things and find ways to keep your mind sharp when it comes to, one, playing football and knowing what you need to accomplish.DAVID BRIGGS: That is a super sharp man and a likely future Hall of Famer Ndamukong Suh. Well, if you don't have a ticket to the Super Bowl, you're not too late. And the trends are, in fact, going in your favor. So maybe be patient. You will, though, have to shell out a ton of cash to go to this game.We're taking a look at the prices all through this week. The cheapest tickets selling for $4,300. That was Monday, according to StubHub. But that number gradually declining through the week, the opposite trend that we usually see-- dropping $200 Tuesday, a huge drop of $500 on Wednesday. And we're finishing out the week with the cheapest ticket costing $3,100. Still a ton of cheddar, but it's come down considerably from the beginning of the week.All that data is for the cheapest ticket to the game. That's in the nosebleeds. If you want the good seats, if you want to bring a friend that you're trying to impress, you've got to really shell out. And here's the cost.You can sit in section 138M, row 44, main end zone. Tickets are a cool $87,000 each. So you and a friend will pay over $174,000 to see the game. You better-- well, we won't go on.Some other trends we're watching, Eagles fans are outselling Chiefs fans by more than double, according to StubHub. That fits what we're hearing from Kevin Cirilli on the ground in Arizona. The ticket vendor seeing a last-minute sales spike in Mexico, the top, number two top selling country outside of the US, behind Canada. And most US buyers are coming from these five states-- no surprise, Pennsylvania, California, New Jersey, Arizona, and Florida. Chiefs fans in Missouri and Kansas accounting for a combined 8% of sales. What's going on, Chiefs fans? You've got a couple of days to try to change that dynamic.Coming up, Apple will be in the spotlight at Super Bowl LVII. Find out what a big Sunday could mean for that company. And we asked you if Rihanna will bring out any surprise guests during the Apple-sponsored Super Bowl halftime show. Roughly 60% of you said ""yes."" We will discuss coming up who that might be. Some of you made predictions. We've got A$AP Rocky, Miley Cyrus, JAY-Z, even Beyoncé as a possible guest. More on what else to expect coming up next.[MUSIC PLAYING]SEANA SMITH: A huge part of the Super Bowl is the halftime show, with many people tuning into the game just for that big performance. This year, Apple is the official sponsor and Rihanna is taking the stage with her first live performance in years. I know I'm very excited for the game. Allie Canal is very excited for the game. She's on the set. Now you don't have to look any further than that jersey that she's wearing for who she's rooting for this weekend.ALLIE CANAL: Go Birds. Go Birds.DAVID BRIGGS: She's chair dancing, man.SEANA SMITH: She's chair dancing.ALLIE CANAL: I'm, like, in such a great mood. I'm so excited.SEANA SMITH: There we go. We're ready.ALLIE CANAL: Right.JOSH SCHAFER: You might have to hide on Monday. I don't know.SEANA SMITH: Lots of hype here. All right, Al, let's talk about the halftime show, right? Because lots of money going into it, lots of hype ahead of this show. What can we expect? And how expensive is it for these musicians?ALLIE CANAL: Well, the NFL, you know, famously doesn't pay the halftime performers. But it does pay for all the upfront costs. So think about the stages, the background dancers, the lighting. That's all the NFL. And that could amount to a pretty hefty price tag, around $17 million.That was a reported cost for last year's show. You know RiRi. She's going to want the production value. It could be even more for that. And for Rihanna, she was asked to do the halftime show back in 2019. She said no in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick.Now she's back. She said she's ready for this moment. She's apparently changed her setlist 39 times. So I am ready for this. And it's going to be very big for her in terms of her streams on those music platforms like Spotify, like Apple Music.If you take a look at the past, last year's performance, which featured Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem, and 50 Cent, each and every one of those performers saw a boost to their personal catalogs. Dr. Dre saw 183% increase in album sales, a 105% bump in on-demand streams. Mary J. Blige, her album sales jumped almost 1,000%, with Snoop Dogg's rising 361%.And then if you take a look at the five years prior, we have The Weeknd, J.Lo, Shakira, Maroon 5, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, all an uptick in digital downloads, album sales, Spotify streams. So the exposure here is unbelievable. And that's really why it's worth it for a lot of these artists. And we've seen an uptick in the amount of viewers that are actually tuning in and watching this halftime show. Last year, for example, viewership was up 7% compared to 2021 with more than 130 million people tuning in. So we'll have to see if Rihanna can get those numbers up even higher, which I think she can.DAVID BRIGGS: Do you really?ALLIE CANAL: I do. People are excited about this.DAVID BRIGGS: I know, I know. I'm excited. Don't get me wrong. A lot of people want to know, opening song and special guest. We've seen a lot of that in recent years. What do you got?ALLIE CANAL: Opening song, I've got ""Run This Town."" That just feels to me like an opening song. Special guest, I think it has to be JAY-Z. JAY-Z's Roc Nation is a producer of the halftime show. Rihanna is also signed to the Roc Nation label. So I feel like he's going to help out his girl. He's featured on a lot of her songs. So that's my prediction. That's where I'm going with it.DAVID BRIGGS: We're going to go around the horn real quick. I'm going to go totally outside the box. I think she is unconventional. I don't think she's going to do anybody predictable. It's going to be a country star. It's going to be like Zach Bryan--SEANA SMITH: That would be a curveball.DAVID BRIGGS: --or Zac Brown Band.JOSH SHAFER: Chris Stapleton stays after the National Anthem?DAVID BRIGGS: Oh, that'd be amazing, my favorite singer of all time. But I think someone-- Sugarland, someone like that. Unconventional, brings in a different portion of the audience.SEANA SMITH: I've got to agree with Allie. I was going to go JAY-Z before we even heard her pick. I think that makes the most sense. We know he has shown a little bit of resistance against the Super Bowl halftime show in the past. I would not be surprised if we see him on that stage on Sunday.JOSH SCHAFER: They always make fun of on the sports shows when everyone picks the same team, right, and we all have the same little icon on the bottom. Because I'm going to pick JAY-Z too.SEANA SMITH: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: So that's when they normally say that's not going to happen. But I don't know. It's my favorite song. ""Run This Town"" is my favorite song. JAY-Z is, obviously, very involved, as Allie said. So that was my pick before everyone else picked. So we've got to stay with it.SEANA SMITH: All right, I like ""Umbrella.""DAVID BRIGGS: Wow.ALLIE CANAL: She's predicting ""Umbrella.""SEANA SMITH: ""Ella-ella-ella.""ALLIE CANAL: ""Umbrella"" as a finale-- I could see a bunch of umbrellas out there.SEANA SMITH: Yes, exactly. It could be a good one. We'll see.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, I like that.SEANA SMITH: Clearly, we are very excited for the halftime show. David, you've got to jump on board here, you know?DAVID BRIGGS: I am, man.SEANA SMITH: We're going to get you to become a Rihanna fan.ALLIE CANAL: He's such a boomer. Dave is a boomer.SEANA SMITH: Sooner rather than later.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm gonna be honest, that's when I get my Buffalo chicken dip, man, whatever.SEANA SMITH: All right.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm here for the game.ALLIE CANAL: OK, boomer.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, thanks so much. Well, Apple, like we've been talking about, replacing Pepsi as the official sponsor for this year's Super Bowl halftime show. $250 million deal spans five years. This is according to the ""Sports Business Journal."" Let's discuss what this means for the tech giant.For that, we want to bring back Dan Ives, Wedbush managing director, its senior equity analyst. Dan, it's great to see you here. So, clearly, a huge move for Apple, now being the sponsor of the halftime show. How big of a win do you think it is for the company?Dan, I think you're muted. And we love the Eagles jersey, by the way. Got it?DAN IVES: OK, so part of what Cook and Cupertino are focused on is really on the NFL and live sports. And this is an important part of, ultimately, what we see Apple doing more and more of over the coming years. I think it's a huge win. And especially in this macro period, Apple doing this further flexes the muscles.SEANA SMITH: Dan, when you talked about Apple here going forward, I think lots of questions just about the amount of money that they have spent or are going to spend on the halftime shows over the next several years. When you see that, does that make sense for them, given the fact that there's no guaranteed return on this type of investment?DAN IVES: But Apple, they're tacticians in terms of how they spend. And this is something they don't just do quickly. And if you look at the history, I mean, they have basically made big bets that have been home successes. And I also I think at this juncture, it's very important that they're investing at a time where some others maybe be are pulling back. And I think that's an important time, especially going into more iPhone launches as well as some other technologies I'd expect them to introduce over the coming months.DAVID BRIGGS: You thought they were going to take a big swing at the Sunday NFL Ticket package. What happened there? Did they end up making a bid? Did it just get out of the range they wanted to spend? And do you think they'll take another pass at an NBA, NFL type of property?DAN IVES: Yeah, and, look, I think there was significant involvement. I think some reports have talked about it. I just think it got to a point where they're only going to spend a certain amount. Ultimately, they were not going to go to that level.But live sports is the key to streaming. I mean, that is one of the keys for Apple when it comes to the streaming piece. I don't think they're stopping here. I think they're going to go after major sports over the coming years. When you look at that content strategy, I mean, it just further highlights whether it's streaming in terms of on TV or what we see with Apple Music, services, under the radar, has actually morphed into a pretty massive business.DAVID BRIGGS: How much will live sports mean for this tech battle? We just discussed Apple. You've got Google who made the big play for Sunday NFL Ticket, $2 and 1/2 billion a year, rumored to be per year, and then Amazon, of course, already in with Thursday Night Football. Or is it not that important in terms of the overall growth investor story?DAN IVES: I think it's a golden jewel, I mean, in terms of what big tech is focused on with streaming. Live sports is what is ultimately-- and that's why the value continues to go up. Because that's just traditional media. I think big tech is going to take significant bets on live sports over the coming year, especially as you look into '23, '24, '25, '26, a lot sort of come up for renewal. And I think streaming is going to be a big part of that over the coming years.SEANA SMITH: Dan, we don't have to ask you who you're rooting for, very clear. Got to ask you about the score. What do you think it's going to be on Sunday?DAN IVES: I see Eagles by 10.SEANA SMITH: OK.DAN IVES: I think, ultimately, yeah, I think between Hurts and that defense, I see a lot of happy fans in the 215 area code.SEANA SMITH: I hope you are right. 215 area code is my hometown. Dan Ives, great to see you. Thanks so much.DAN IVES: Thank you.SEANA SMITH: All right, Josh has another bet that he's watching over there. What do you got now, Josh?JOSH SCHAFER: All right, guys, we've got the coin toss now. You can bet on a 50/50 coin toss. I know, how exciting, right? But people will do it.And we asked our viewers what they picked. And they like heads. We had 55% or just about 55% of people say that they would vote heads or bet heads. But then when you look actually at where the money is right now at a place like Caesars Sportsbook, the money's on tails.58% of people betting on tails. You can see the odds right there, -102 and -102. Of course, even odds because, again, it's a 50/50 bet. Now, if you want to go fun stats, four out of the last five Super Bowls were heads.DAVID BRIGGS: That is nice research.SEANA SMITH: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: So I don't know if that makes you think your tails is due or--SEANA SMITH: What would you bet, Josh?JOSH SCHAFER: I would go heads.SEANA SMITH: You would go heads?JOSH SCHAFER: Yes, in a former life, I did the coin toss all the time. I always went heads. You've got to play the same one every time. I think you have to do a strategy on a 50/50.SEANA SMITH: Stick with it.DAVID BRIGGS: Real quickly, I want your pick with the spread. It's Philly by 1 and 1/2. Who do you got?JOSH SCHAFER: Dave, I have a lot of bets set up. Why don't we talk about that in about 10 minutes?DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, all right. Nice tease.JOSH SCHAFER: Coming up next, the Super Bowl ad landscape is getting a makeover. Find out why sports betting platforms like FanDuel could be a winning bet on Sunday.[MUSIC PLAYING]- It's called the kick of destiny.- What the heck is kick of destiny?- Good luck. See you in Phoenix. Don't miss.- Oh, boy.DAVID BRIGGS: Oh, it's going to be live, 45 yard field goal for Gronk FanDuel's Kick of Destiny campaign starring Rob Gronkowski, getting plenty of buzz ahead of the big game. Who else is getting bang for their 7 million bucks? John Connors is the co-founder and CEO of marketing and communications agency Boathouse. He joins us now. John, good to see you, man.So last year was labeled the Crypto Bowl. How significant a presence is gambling making? Did they replace crypto?JOHN CONNORS: Yeah, I think to your point, this year is going to be the-- you know, the booze, chips, and gambling bowl all combined. And I love the fact that you led with Gronk.SEANA SMITH: Well, speaking of it being the booze, chips, and gambling bowl, let's talk about the gambling aspect of it with the booze. Because Molson Coors is back in the Super Bowl after more than 30 years. They're teaming up with DraftKings. And what's interesting about this initiative is that they're allowing users to bet on who they think, for example, what beer is going to appear first, what dog is going to be used in the commercial. From your perspective, just the engagement aspect of this, how smart is that? And what do you think we'll hear from other alcohol brands this Sunday?JOHN CONNORS: Yeah, I mean, I think, to your point, you can't separate gambling from the Super Bowl, right? And so the ability to make that brand connection and to get that engagement, these days, everyone's trying to figure out how they can drive up that engagement value, how they can drive up that social value, how they can drive up the conversation. And so I think FanDuel and DraftKings have done masterful jobs, sort of between the Gronk bet and the betting on Coors Miller and all the other pieces of driving up as much conversation as possible.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, the live element of the FanDuel ad, have we ever seen anything like that? And how big do you think that will pay off?JOHN CONNORS: I think we've seen things like that, but not in the Super Bowl, right? So I think at this level, I mean, I think you've seen a lot of categories try and launch a lot of new ideas all the way back to Apple in 1984. It's always a massive platform for new launches. And I think as those two exchange blows to sort of capture attention, capture volume, I think it's a masterful play.SEANA SMITH: Well, John, for the big ads, they're pricing out just around $7 million for 30 seconds. We're seeing many companies team up. Like we've been talking about one GM and Netflix in this ad starring Will Ferrell.WILL FERRELL: General Motors is going electric. And Netflix is joining by including more EVs in their movies and shows. The least they can do. So, if you're going to get swarmed by an army of the dead, why not get swarmed in an EV? Ew. I said no biting.- Oh.WILL FERRELL: Or if you're being voluntarily kidnapped, why not be kidnapped in an EV? What's that scent? Is it pine?SEANA SMITH: So GM teaming up with Netflix, trying to push their EVs to make them more mainstream. What do you think of this strategy, a big streamer teaming up with an automaker?JOHN CONNORS: I think you're seeing-- well, last year's automakers were an interesting strategy. It was majority of electric vehicles when none of them had the electric vehicles yet. So they were all teasing sort of what was coming down the road. I think you're seeing that collaboration piece across the Super Bowl this year. I think, you know, the marketers like to follow the artists. And the artists have been doing collabs for a long time.And I think we're just seeing a significant number. As you know as well, there's a little more safety in a collaboration. Sort of two teams, two big brands like Netflix and GM going at it together just drives it a little bit more safety for that chief marketing officer.SEANA SMITH: All right, John Connors, thanks so much for joining us. I know a lot of us are very excited for all the ads that we will be seeing in just two days from now.JOHN CONNORS: Go Eagles.SEANA SMITH: Well, coming up, the Super Bowl Indicator. We'll tell you how stocks may perform next week based on the big game's outcome. Stay with us.[MUSIC PLAYING]JOSH SCHAFER: Welcome back to our Super Bowl special here on Yahoo Finance. Normally, we talk plenty about market indicators on this show, like a 100-day moving average or how stocks perform in election years. But some say even sports can tell us where Mr. Market is headed over the next year. Ryan Detrick over at Carson Research recently released the latest data for what's known as the Super Bowl Indicator, which tells us how markets perform depending on the outcome of the big game.So let's keep it simple to start. Markets have historically performed better after a team from the NFC conference wins than if the AFC wins. You can see here that's 10% for the NFC, an average return 6.9% for the AFC. So, really, people should be rooting for this indicator for the Eagles, who are in the NFC. That would give us a better return per the data.Now that was a historical chart, of course, going all the way back and counting all outcomes. But both these teams have also won Super Bowls in the past. So the Eagles have won one Super Bowl just a couple of years ago. And the S&amp;P 500 fell 6.2% that year.The Chiefs have won two Super Bowls. When you average those together, that's up 8.1%. So not a lot to take there, only three games. I don't think that's my favorite one. Let's get to my favorite one.Market bulls should really be rooting for a blowout on Sunday. So if you take a look here, the average return of the S&amp;P 500 is 8.5%. Now, when there's a single-digit win in the Super Bowl, it goes up 4.9% on average. When there's a double-digit win in the Super Bowl, it goes up 10.9% on average. But when there's a blowout and someone wins by 21 points or more, there's a blowout in the markets too. And the S&amp;P 500 rises on average 13.6% that year.So I don't know about you guys, I might root for an Eagles blowout on Sunday.SEANA SMITH: Heck yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Maybe my 401(k) can recover from last year a little bit.DAVID BRIGGS: Philly fan here is going to root for that. That will not happen. They could have a comfortable win, but not a blowout win.JOSH SCHAFER: Well, keep that thought.DAVID BRIGGS: Where is the public money at?JOSH SCHAFER: The public money? Let's take a look at the public money, Dave. So we know the spread is 1 and 1/2, right, coming into this game. So the Eagles are favored by 1 and 1/2. And the public money right now is on the Eagles.So 69% of the handle on DraftKings Sportsbook is currently on the Eagles to cover that 1 and 1/2 point spread. So that means they'd have to win by 2. And then where I really want to bet on Sunday, I think, because I love the totals, is 51. So 51 is the total. And that's where people are betting right now.Here's my favorite bet, though. Travis Kelce, first touchdown. I bet it earlier in the playoffs. It hit. I love the first touchdown bets. It's really exciting to watch the first couple drives and see it. Plus 700, I'm all over it, Dave.Seana, what are you watching on Sunday? Give us a bet. You've got to give us a pick.SEANA SMITH: All right, well, I went in with a parlay. And I stole this from Ross Tucker, full disclosure. But I've got to give credit where credit's due. And I liked it. I liked it a lot.So let's talk about it. I think Jalen Hurts is going to score a touchdown. I think Haason Reddick is also going to get a sack. And I also think that the Eagles are going to win. And I'm confident in it.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, Tucker's a pretty good gambler. He's no dummy. I've got a dumb bet. Because these are dumb bets when you have multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple things that have to happen. Patrick Mahomes over 1 and 1/2 touchdowns, Travis Kelce over 50 yards, AJ Brown over 50 yards, DeVonta Smith-- receiver for the Eagles-- under 63 and 1/2 yards, and Jalen Hurts over 40 yards rushing. Full disclosure, I also stole mine from a 15-year-old who lives in my house. But he's pretty good at this.JOSH SCHAFER: It seems like we bet a lot on the ankle injuries there and the lower extremities. How healthy is Jalen Hurts? How healthy is Patrick Mahomes? To talk football a little bit, I'm nervous about some of those prop bets. I've heard some--DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, you don't like it? You don't like it?JOSH SCHAFER: I don't know.DAVID BRIGGS: Well, look, the thing-- now, I say a dumb bet because those have such tremendous odds that they lure in a lot of people because they pay off well. But no one ever wins them.JOSH SCHAFER: They have the highest hold rate for sportsbooks. Sportsbooks want you to bet those same game parlays because they make the most money off of them. But coming up, we're talking about inflation. It's crashing your Super Bowl party. Find out how much you'll need to shell out for food and drinks when we come back.[MUSIC PLAYING]SEANA SMITH: What good is watching football if you don't have a bevy of snacks and also drinks to enjoy during the big game? But this year, you've got to keep a very close eye on that price tag. Because when it comes to checkout, some fan favorites are much pricier than they've been in years past. Allie Canal joining us now with a closer look at what we will be paying this weekend. Allie, what do you got?ALLIE CANAL: Wow, the good news is, Seana, if you want some chicken wings-- which we have on our set now-- that's actually cheaper, 22% cheaper compared to this time last year, $2.65 versus $3.38 per pound the week of Super Bowl 2022. And that's due to a larger supply of wings, decreased freight costs, all of that driving prices lower. And if you want to get a little bit fancier than wings, we have sirloin steak prices. That's also down by about $1 per pound. I feel like you really are a steak guy, Philly cheesesteak maybe?DAVID BRIGGS: Not during the Super Bowl.SEANA SMITH: Philly cheesesteak--ALLIE CANAL: Philly cheesesteak, though-- I think that could be an option.JOSH SCHAFER: You can't have a steak during the Super Bowl.ALLIE CANAL: I know, so you probably want to stick with the wings. Plus, 22% versus, you know, versus the $1 less, I think you go with the wings here. But chips and guac, avocados, they're also down, which is nice. But something that's up is your beer, 11% higher.SEANA SMITH: Wow.DAVID BRIGGS: And they've seen demand slip because of that towards the end of the year, yeah.ALLIE CANAL: And I think it's interesting too that soft drinks as well, they're up 25% So it's actually cheaper to get a little buzz going than just stay sober during the game. But we were talking about--SEANA SMITH: You need another reason to go out and get a drink during the big game.JOSH SHAFER: In the spirit of that--ALLIE CANAL: In the spirit of that, but talking about spirits, though, that's actually only up 2% while wine is up 3%. So maybe a little sangria action if you don't want the beer. That's a cheaper option.DAVID BRIGGS: Not bad.ALLIE CANAL: But, overall, I think for the Super Bowl people, people want to drink their beer.DAVID BRIGGS: Wings versus boneless wings, Allie. You are the expert. We have them both here. Seana and I are team boneless.SEANA SMITH: We are.ALLIE CANAL: I'm not Team Boneless. I am--SEANA SMITH: We're on a little island by ourselves.ALLIE CANAL: I'm bone-in, but I'm flats over drumsticks all day.SEANA SMITH: Oh, yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah.SEANA SMITH: What about you?JOSH SCHAFER: No, I'm absolutely bone-in. I am of the take that if you have boneless wings, they're actually just--ALLIE CANAL: That just looks sad.JOSH SCHAFER: --those are chicken nuggets. Those are chicken nuggets. Those are chicken nuggets.DAVID BRIGGS: Josh, Seana, Allie--SEANA SMITH: I will eat them all to myself.DAVID BRIGGS: --thank you, guys. That'll do it for our big game coverage. Enjoy the weekend. Enjoy the Super Bowl. And we'll see you on Monday.ALLIE CANAL: Go Birds.]"

We will see who the winner is.Story continues[MUSIC PLAYING]DAVID BRIGGS: Hey, everybody. Welcome into our Super Bowl LVII coverage. I'm Dave Briggs, alongside Seana Smith. Cannot wait for this game. We've got a lot coming your way over the next hour. I'm really excited for the game itself, but I want you to go first on what you're eyeing in the game, or outside the game.SEANA SMITH: Well, in the game-- I'm going to say an overall thing-- it's going to be the Eagles, my hometown team. I am very, very excited for them going for their second title in the last six years. Specific, Jalen Hurts, it's all about him. He's got to keep the momentum. I'm excited about that. Aside from the game, the halftime show. Apple is now going-- is the official sponsor of the show this year, taking over from Pepsi. Rihanna is back on the live music stage. I'm excited.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm just out of the loop on Rihanna. I'm sorry. I don't want to offend anybody. I just don't get it. But I know she's awesome. I'm excited because, look, I think the Eagles have a far superior roster. I do acknowledge that. But Andy Reid always has something interesting up his sleeve. Something you have never seen before, and Patrick Mahomes has that Harry-Potter-like wand. He has magic. I think they actually should be a 7 or an 8-point underdog. I think the Eagles are a much better team. But the Chiefs can really surprise you, but I'll be honest, what I'm really looking forward to is my only Super Bowl tradition, my wife's buffalo chicken dip. It's awesome. Like, that's all that matters for me on Super Bowl Sunday.SEANA SMITH: You're going to bring over the leftovers on Monday, then.DAVID BRIGGS: There won't be any, dude.SEANA SMITH: Well, maybe you should--DAVID BRIGGS: I'll be, like, scraping--SEANA SMITH: --leave a little bit--DAVID BRIGGS: --the bowl with my fingers when the chips run out.SEANA SMITH: I got to get the recipe after this show. All right, well, this might be the biggest Super Bowl yet for the gambling industry. Lots to look forward to this weekend. The American Gaming Association releasing its predictions for Super Bowl LVII, estimating that about 50 million Americans will bet roughly $16 billion on this year's game. That's more than double last year's total, but our own, Josh Schafer, has been looking further into this number, what it really means for the sportsbook operators. What do you got for us, Josh?JOSH SHAFER: That's right, Seana. So that's $16 billion number is, obviously, a massive number, but not all of that is going to go right to the sportsbook. So for starters, that number includes both bets placed legally and illegally. It's also an estimate. And if we take a look at last year's estimate, 7.61 billion translated to just $950 million of legal handle. That's according to the AGA's assessment of state data.So less than 15% of last year's estimation ended up as legal handle. Now, the total amount at legal books, and then if you have to think about how these sportsbooks make money, right? So you take that handle-- that legal handle, that $950 million and then you subtract what's known as the gross winning margin, or you multiply it by that gross winning margin, which is only 10% on average.Then when you multiply those, you end up only getting $95 million as the total legal handle-- or, sorry, the gross gaming revenue, which is what goes back to the sportsbooks. That's the number that ends up getting taxed, and that can be taxed, guys, at about an average of a 20% rate. So there are $95 million then taxed at 20%, it's just not quite as big as that $16 billion number we like to talk about all the time, but it is still a huge week, Dave. The stocks have been roaring headed into the Super Bowl. The three or four of the gambling stocks here over the last month, so it certainly is an exciting time.DAVID BRIGGS: You just took like an extra large pizza and boiled it down to one slice.JOSH SHAFER: But that slice could be delicious. That slice could be absolutely delicious.DAVID BRIGGS: And it's still a pretty solid slice. It's a New York-sized slice. But the game is not in New York. It's in Arizona. And that's the first time we've ever had a legal sports gambling state host a Super Bowl. What does that mean? What are the implications?JOSH SHAFER: Well, it means that people can bet well they're sitting in the stadium, right? And that's the biggest thing that we're going to be watching, and really what I want to point out here too is the tax rate. So Arizona taxes mobile betting at a 10% rate, and why I'm watching that number is because Arizona is probably going to have a higher handle this Sunday than they normally would. They're going to get a 10% rate on that. They're going to get a lot of state revenue, guys. And I'm curious how that leads moving forward. As we continue to see gambling grow, are more states going to want the Super Bowl to bring in a lot of gamblers, get people excited for the game and get more state revenue? Seems like a decent deal to me.DAVID BRIGGS: Where's the game next year? Vegas, baby. I mean--JOSH SHAFER: Not a bad place for gambling.DAVID BRIGGS: That seems like it'll work out well. Great stuff. 50. 50 million Americans expected to throw down $16 billion in bets on Super Bowl LVII. Let's dig into those numbers with DraftKings CEO, Jason Robins. Jason, good to see you, man. 33 states now legal. How big is this weekend for you guys compared to anything you've seen in the past? What are your expectations?JASON ROBINS: Oh, I mean, given the growth of the industry, this is almost certainly going to be our biggest Super Bowl ever. And hard to know, it's always-- we always have predictions around the office going in because it's such a fun time. But one thing we know is it's going to be a big day. We know it's going to be our biggest customer acquisition day, and we're all excited to see the results. By the way, I heard in the other set, you're betting on red for the Gatorade? Is that-- I hear that right?DAVID BRIGGS: Do I have the wrong color, bro?JASON ROBINS: Listen, I don't know, but somebody told me, and you should verify this because I did not verify myself that there has never been red Gatorade poured on the winning coach in the Super Bowl. So maybe this is the year, but just a little hot take for you to check out. And I could be totally wrong on that. It was something somebody told me, but you should check that out.DAVID BRIGGS: Betting scoop. I appreciate that, buddy. That is solid. I had my eye on like an Eagles Green, so I'm going to have to look at the odds here on DraftKings.SEANA SMITH: Jeez, I think I picked orange. Hopefully, my odds are a little bit better than what Dave is facing right now, but, Jason, you talk about the popularity of sports betting, certainly we have seen massive growth over the last several years. With the Super Bowl in Arizona, like we're talking about, the first state with statewide legalized sports gambling here, in terms of the number of users that you are expected to add, can you put a number on that?JASON ROBINS: We can. I mean, one, we actually have earnings next week. So I've got to be careful about saying anything like that, but, also, it's just tough to predict. I mean, so much comes in towards the end and the last day, and even in the last hours. And so hard to say, but I know that we think it'll be our biggest day ever, and that's been the case for the last three Superbowls, or last-- excuse me, four Super Bowls since legalized sports betting as well.JOSH SHAFER: Jason, I'm curious what you're seeing out of the live betting space. Obviously, I think it being in Arizona probably helps, right? With people being excited while they're at the game, to probably bet during the game while they're sitting in the stands. I know often we talk about that Europe number, right? Maybe getting to 70, 75% of all bets, or all handle being in that live betting space. Do you think we eventually get there? Or is that where things are headed? How have you sort of seen those trends?JASON ROBINS: You know, live betting continues to increase. I think whether we get there or higher or a little lower, I don't know. But I think it's going to continue to grow. I think more and more people are starting to see that you can make bets during the game. And that doesn't just mean things like what's the next play or something like that.Some people decide, hey, maybe at halftime, they want to double down on the bet they made before the game. Or maybe they want to switch sides or something like that. So lots of options throughout the game.We also, you mentioned Arizona. This is the first year since legalized sports betting outside of Nevada that you will have a Super Bowl in a state with legal sports betting. So really excited to see how that plays out. I agree with you. I think it's going to have a tremendous halo effect on the state.Because not only the people at the game, but all the people that are in Arizona that know that the Super Bowl is here and are paying attention. And we're doing everything we can to let all the people coming in from out of town know, hey, while you're here, you can make a bet. And I think you're going to see a lot of fans take us up on that.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, that is interesting. And next year it'll be the second in a row because it's in Vegas.JASON ROBINS: Yeah.DAVID BRIGGS: But in terms of the big picture, certainly all the momentum is on the side of the sports gambling. But those three big states are out there-- California, Texas, and Florida. What went wrong in California? And when do you see any of those three states turning legal?JASON ROBINS: Well, I mean, California, it's pretty simple. We had over $200 million in opposition spent against us. I think, you know, eight times maybe is close to that, the next biggest opposition spend of any campaign. So, you know, we were literally attacked with a barrage of ads, many of them pushing false narratives. But not much you can do in a short cycle. And people hear what they hear. And, unfortunately, I think some incorrect facts got out there.So, you know, I think, first, we're going to try to work with the tribes. Obviously, that's a much easier path than trying to fight them. And nobody wants that. We actually had in our ballot initiative revenue going to the tribes. We had tethering to the tribes. Everything had to flow through the tribes.And, you know, we're going to hopefully get another year, another, I guess, two years from now. Well, one year from now, we're going to be able to potentially take another shot. And I think we have to learn from last time and educate a little better and be smarter about it. So we'll see on that.One Texas is in play this year. I think there's a live bill that has a decent shot of advancing. We'll have to see. Obviously, a lot to play out in the legislative session. So, you know, I think those are the two biggest states.Florida, you mentioned also, you know, tribal state, so has some of the same dynamics. But in that case, it's really one tribe, the Seminoles. So, you know, trying to figure out a way to collaborate with them, I think.And, hopefully, that's where the industry is going. There's just more collaboration. And everybody realizes that a rising tide will lift all ships. And, you know, I think that's something that we're seeing slowly but surely to try and move towards. But still a lot of work to do there, and especially in those big states. They're big prizes. So there's obviously going to be a lot of interest and a lot of stakeholders.SEANA SMITH: All right, Jason Robins, CEO of DraftKings, always great to have you. Thanks so much. Have fun this weekend.JASON ROBINS: OK, thank you so much.SEANA SMITH: All right, well, Arizona, like we've been talking about, is hosting this year's Super Bowl. Hundreds of thousands of fans are already there, getting ready for the big game. Yahoo Finance contributor Kevin Cirilli is doing just that. And Kevin, I know you spoke with a lot of key voices down there. I've got to say, I'm very jealous. I wish I was in your shoes right now. Give us a lay of the land. What's it like down there in Arizona right now?KEVIN CIRILLI: Well, when the plane landed at Sky Harbor, I thought I was in Ireland. Because all I kept seeing was green. There are literally-- I mean, there's-- I've seen like maybe one or two Chiefs fans. But, I mean, it's all Eagles fans everywhere. So, I mean, I feel like I'm at home here in sunny Scottsdale. Camelback Mountain behind me, if you know the area.Look, I was at the Phoenix Open, the Waste Management Open earlier this week, which has really become a business private partnership, a public private partnership, really a hub that Jack Selby, who's the managing director for Peter Thiel's family, and he's got his own venture capitalist investing $110 million here in the state. He started this thing. And it's really gone global.And one of the folks he was able to get out there was governor Katie Hobbs, the newly-elected Democratic governor of Arizona. And she noted the economic impact that the Super Bowl, that the Phoenix Open that that's having on this state. Take a listen to what she told me on the 17th hole.KATIE HOBBS: It is huge. It is huge. We have 160,000 workers in our tourism and hospitality industry that are ready to welcome the visitors that are already here, making sure they have a great experience. That gets return visits. And that helps our economy. The last time we had the Super Bowl in 2015, the economic impact was over $700 million.- $700 million?KATIE HOBBS: Yeah, yeah With over 100,000 visitors. So we're expecting to top that. And the lasting benefits for our economy, because we've become sort of-- we have a great track record with these kind of big events. And it's just going to attract more of them in the future.KEVIN CIRILLI: So when you look at the numbers, last year alone, $24.2 billion worth in the sports and tourism industry contributed to Arizona's GDP. They're expecting that the Super Bowl alone will increase that number to more than $1,000,000,000. So you could see a five percentage increase in that regard.But a lot of economic development here outside of sports. The semiconductor chip manufacturing that's being conducted here in the state, something that President Biden talked about in his State of the Union address earlier this week. Remember, Intel, TSMC building their fab factories down here.The governor is excited about that. Jack Selby is excited about that. A lot happening. They're trying to give Austin a run for their money.DAVID BRIGGS: All right, quickly, I know you're a big fan. I know you think Philly is going to win. Give me a score. And what's the particular edge you think that Philly has over KC?KEVIN CIRILLI: All right, well, one, the fans. That's the edge, clearly. Two, they're going to essentially be playing in a home stadium. And, three, I'm thinking it'll be 27-24, Birds. I do think it's going to be a nail-biter. I heard you compare-- I heard you compare the Chiefs to Hogwarts. And I got to say, that is not the case, OK? Like the Eagles are Gryffindor, let me just put it that way. How's that?DAVID BRIGGS: First off, it was Patrick Mahomes is Harry Potter, has a bit of wizardry to him. Let's get it straight, Cirilli, all right?KEVIN CIRILLI: OK.DAVID BRIGGS: Good luck, brother. Enjoy it out there, OK?KEVIN CIRILLI: I appreciate it. That's awesome, awesome. I'll talk to you guys later. Thank you for having me.DAVID BRIGGS: All right, we're going to be taking a look now at some prop bets through the hour. Our Josh Schafer, he is our resident junky gambler. And he's going to break it down for us. I need some prop action. So what do you got?JOSH SCHAFER: We've got some fun ones here for you guys. We're going to start with Gatorade, which sounds like it's a hot topic for you two. And--DAVID BRIGGS: Yep.SEANA SMITH: Yes.JOSH SCHAFER: --I'm not going to lie, where did we pick? Who had red? Someone had red, right?DAVID BRIGGS: I took red.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, all right, you're with 8% of the handle here. That's plus 450 odds, Dave. So what you're looking at is where people are betting. So the most bet on Gatorade is yellow. 40% of the money is on yellow. And then you've got 20% of the money on blue, 20% of the money on orange.SEANA SMITH: That's my pick.JOSH SCHAFER: My pick-- I've got to step out of the way here-- is purple. Because I think Riptide Rush is the best Gatorade. And that's simply all I'm picking off of. There is some fun stats, if you guys want to go deep into this, right? Orange is the most picked. That's probably why Seana picked it. It's come up the most times since 2001.SEANA SMITH: I did my research.JOSH SCHAFER: And then yellow is also very popular right now among Eagles fans. So yellow was poured on Doug Pederson at the NFC Championship and the Super Bowl the last time the Eagles won. And Nick Sirianni two weeks ago had yellow Gatorade poured on him.DAVID BRIGGS: Oh.SEANA SMITH: I love that flavor.JOSH SCHAFER: We like yellow.DAVID BRIGGS: That's a solid scoop. There are some of these colors, Josh, that are a little bit in between, that there's like a greenish-blue. You know what I mean, that greenish-blue Gatorade.JOSH SCHAFER: Green-blue, well, we've got yellow-green.DAVID BRIGGS: Right, I'm looking at it--JOSH SCHAFER: We're going to have to call back up Jason Robins--SEANA SMITH: You're the one that's disputing the color of Gatorade.JOSH SCHAFER: --and dispute what color you had. Because yellow-green is the only unclear one here. Then you've got red-pink.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, that would be pretty clear.DAVID BRIGGS: But like, pink?SEANA SMITH: That's going to be a tough one to argue with.DAVID BRIGGS: Is that even a Gatorade?JOSH SCHAFER: That's why I'm going with purple. It's simple.DAVID BRIGGS: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: I don't know if it's ever happened.SEANA SMITH: I'm going orange.JOSH SCHAFER: But I'm going purple.DAVID BRIGGS: OK, all right, that's a good job.JOSH SCHAFER: All right, coming up, Eagles defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh who competes for his second Super Bowl ring on Sunday also boasts an impressive investing portfolio. He'll tell us more about it next.[MUSIC PLAYING]No shortage of storylines ahead of Super Bowl LVII. We've got the first ever meeting of Black quarterbacks, the first ever meeting between two brothers in Jason and Travis Kelce, and the third Super Bowl with three different teams from one of the greatest defensive linemen in NFL history. I'm talking about Eagles five time all-pro defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, who joins us now.Great of you to find the time during this busy week, my friend. So three teams, three Super Bowls. What makes this experience different for you?NDAMUKONG SUH: The experience each and every single year is different. No matter what team you're with, whether you've been with the team for 10 years or two years, every year is different. Every team is different and always going to continue to be that way, unfortunately. But that's part of the business. But it's exciting to have an opportunity to get back to the Super Bowl and have another opportunity to win.SEANA SMITH: Ndamukong, it's great to see. You're playing for my hometown team. So I am clearly rooting for you on Sunday. You're playing this time for Nick Sirianni. Who's not that much older than you. From your time with the Eagles this year, what have you learned from him just in terms of the leadership and his success that he's clearly having so early in his career?NDAMUKONG SUH: He's a great coach. Having played against him last year in the playoffs when I was down in Tampa and we took care of business that first round, but he's a great coach. He understands all the different nuances, has an opportunity to be a leader on the offensive side of the ball, but also understand the defense and how we want to particularly rush up front and get off the quarterbacks. And I think from the standpoint of his leadership, he just understands, it's all about keeping detail-oriented process, focusing on the things that count the most when it comes to situational ball and going from there.DAVID BRIGGS: I mentioned that quarterback match-up, which is so intriguing. Tell me about the key to defending, to stopping, to containing Patrick Mahomes. And if I could ask a double, you shut down your quarterback, Jalen Hurts, this time last year a bit earlier. How much has he grown in that one year?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, we'll start first with Patrick Mahomes. He's a great talent, very, very elusive, to say the least. I've been going against him in years past, but most notably in the 2021 Super Bowl that I won with Tampa. He's just always extending the play. And that's something that as a defensive line that we have to focus on.There's no end in rushing. Until that ball either incomplete or you got a sack and he's fully, fully down, you've got to keep rushing. Because he loves to extend plays and make things happen and getting balls to the receivers, especially 87.And so when it comes to transitioning to Jalen, I think Jalen has grown tremendously. He's found a way to not only hurt people with his feet, but as well as his arm. And I think the GM Howard did an amazing job defining great talent around him and adding some pieces, for example, AJ Brown.DAVID BRIGGS: Boy, has he come a long way in just one year. Speaking of, you've come a long way over your career. You were once voted the dirtiest player in the league. You've been fined more than $600,000. But, recently, you played peacekeeper against the Niners. How do you think you have evolved over these 13 years? Or were you just misunderstood?NDAMUKONG SUH: I've always said it, if people ever take the time to really get to understand me and get to know me and really truthfully be unbiased when it comes to my personality and my character, they wouldn't have made those votes and they wouldn't have had that particular characteristics around me as a person. I've always been some sort of a peacekeeper or, if you want to call it that. But I know Trent well. So when he saw me getting in front of him and it wasn't about anything other than the game is pretty much over, let's move on, let's get to the next play and go from there.SEANA SMITH: You've clearly had a lot of success on the field. You've also had a lot of success off the field as well. I know you have invested in over 30 companies. One of your mentors is actually Warren Buffett. Talk to us just about that relationship, the biggest lessons that you've learned from him, and how that's really helped shape your investment career.NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think the biggest thing that I've learned from Mr. Buffett is just being able to have good people around you. And as you see, he has multiple companies. He trusts those folks and puts them in places and empowers them.And that's something that I like to do, not only in my foundation with my family and my wife, but also being to be able to empower people, whether it's in the real estate realm, having a development company, being able to build multifamily housing, being able to take care of other people and finding ways to find affordable housing for folks that should be afforded to them at all times. And it's tough in this day and age, especially going through the pandemic. You saw that it's probably its worst. And so hopefully we can continue as a collective to get better in that space. But when it comes to investing, I just have fun with it.I love learning. I love being able to sit down with folks. I actually sat down with one of our owners yesterday to have a great conversation of how he built his company with KKR. I've done some work with them. And so it's a fun opportunity for me to just be able to build relationships and learn from folks and then being able to be involved and be hands-on.SEANA SMITH: You mentioned your involvement in real estate there a moment ago, some of your initiatives, how you're looking to tackle housing affordability. From your perspective from your involvement in the space over the last several years, what more do you think needs to be done? And how do we better address this issue?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think it's-- I think one of the key things that we could do, especially when it comes to affordable housing, is kind of take it out of the city and state's hands. If we privatize it in a manner and incentivize private real estate people, it'd be great. Because if you really look at it and break down the numbers from a perspective how I look at it, it's one of the most expensive housing just because of the rules and regulations that go into it, which I understand and respect. But if we potentially looked at it being privatized, I think would be a lot faster and to be able to be something that is afforded to people a lot quicker.SEANA SMITH: You're involved in over 30 companies here. I think a lot of people at home are asking, how do you have the time for this? How involved are you with each investment?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think I'm very, very involved in every single day, finding time to be able to do it. But it's really being able to compartmentalize things. Obviously, playing football pulls me away from it a fair amount. But I've been at it for 13 years. I understand how I need to study, how I need to focus, even going into a very important week like this week with the Super Bowl, I can still look at things. I probably won't as detailed and push it off just a week or two.But, for me, I still look at opportunities and find time to do it. And I think one of the greatest things that helps you keep you sharp. Because if you get overloaded in one particular thing, then you don't have the capacity to go and look at other things and find ways to keep your mind sharp when it comes to, one, playing football and knowing what you need to accomplish.DAVID BRIGGS: That is a super sharp man and a likely future Hall of Famer Ndamukong Suh. Well, if you don't have a ticket to the Super Bowl, you're not too late. And the trends are, in fact, going in your favor. So maybe be patient. You will, though, have to shell out a ton of cash to go to this game.We're taking a look at the prices all through this week. The cheapest tickets selling for $4,300. That was Monday, according to StubHub. But that number gradually declining through the week, the opposite trend that we usually see-- dropping $200 Tuesday, a huge drop of $500 on Wednesday. And we're finishing out the week with the cheapest ticket costing $3,100. Still a ton of cheddar, but it's come down considerably from the beginning of the week.All that data is for the cheapest ticket to the game. That's in the nosebleeds. If you want the good seats, if you want to bring a friend that you're trying to impress, you've got to really shell out. And here's the cost.You can sit in section 138M, row 44, main end zone. Tickets are a cool $87,000 each. So you and a friend will pay over $174,000 to see the game. You better-- well, we won't go on.Some other trends we're watching, Eagles fans are outselling Chiefs fans by more than double, according to StubHub. That fits what we're hearing from Kevin Cirilli on the ground in Arizona. The ticket vendor seeing a last-minute sales spike in Mexico, the top, number two top selling country outside of the US, behind Canada. And most US buyers are coming from these five states-- no surprise, Pennsylvania, California, New Jersey, Arizona, and Florida. Chiefs fans in Missouri and Kansas accounting for a combined 8% of sales. What's going on, Chiefs fans? You've got a couple of days to try to change that dynamic.Coming up, Apple will be in the spotlight at Super Bowl LVII. Find out what a big Sunday could mean for that company. And we asked you if Rihanna will bring out any surprise guests during the Apple-sponsored Super Bowl halftime show. Roughly 60% of you said ""yes."" We will discuss coming up who that might be. Some of you made predictions. We've got A$AP Rocky, Miley Cyrus, JAY-Z, even Beyoncé as a possible guest. More on what else to expect coming up next.[MUSIC PLAYING]SEANA SMITH: A huge part of the Super Bowl is the halftime show, with many people tuning into the game just for that big performance. This year, Apple is the official sponsor and Rihanna is taking the stage with her first live performance in years. I know I'm very excited for the game. Allie Canal is very excited for the game. She's on the set. Now you don't have to look any further than that jersey that she's wearing for who she's rooting for this weekend.ALLIE CANAL: Go Birds. Go Birds.DAVID BRIGGS: She's chair dancing, man.SEANA SMITH: She's chair dancing.ALLIE CANAL: I'm, like, in such a great mood. I'm so excited.SEANA SMITH: There we go. We're ready.ALLIE CANAL: Right.JOSH SCHAFER: You might have to hide on Monday. I don't know.SEANA SMITH: Lots of hype here. All right, Al, let's talk about the halftime show, right? Because lots of money going into it, lots of hype ahead of this show. What can we expect? And how expensive is it for these musicians?ALLIE CANAL: Well, the NFL, you know, famously doesn't pay the halftime performers. But it does pay for all the upfront costs. So think about the stages, the background dancers, the lighting. That's all the NFL. And that could amount to a pretty hefty price tag, around $17 million.That was a reported cost for last year's show. You know RiRi. She's going to want the production value. It could be even more for that. And for Rihanna, she was asked to do the halftime show back in 2019. She said no in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick.Now she's back. She said she's ready for this moment. She's apparently changed her setlist 39 times. So I am ready for this. And it's going to be very big for her in terms of her streams on those music platforms like Spotify, like Apple Music.If you take a look at the past, last year's performance, which featured Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem, and 50 Cent, each and every one of those performers saw a boost to their personal catalogs. Dr. Dre saw 183% increase in album sales, a 105% bump in on-demand streams. Mary J. Blige, her album sales jumped almost 1,000%, with Snoop Dogg's rising 361%.And then if you take a look at the five years prior, we have The Weeknd, J.Lo, Shakira, Maroon 5, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, all an uptick in digital downloads, album sales, Spotify streams. So the exposure here is unbelievable. And that's really why it's worth it for a lot of these artists. And we've seen an uptick in the amount of viewers that are actually tuning in and watching this halftime show. Last year, for example, viewership was up 7% compared to 2021 with more than 130 million people tuning in. So we'll have to see if Rihanna can get those numbers up even higher, which I think she can.DAVID BRIGGS: Do you really?ALLIE CANAL: I do. People are excited about this.DAVID BRIGGS: I know, I know. I'm excited. Don't get me wrong. A lot of people want to know, opening song and special guest. We've seen a lot of that in recent years. What do you got?ALLIE CANAL: Opening song, I've got ""Run This Town."" That just feels to me like an opening song. Special guest, I think it has to be JAY-Z. JAY-Z's Roc Nation is a producer of the halftime show. Rihanna is also signed to the Roc Nation label. So I feel like he's going to help out his girl. He's featured on a lot of her songs. So that's my prediction. That's where I'm going with it.DAVID BRIGGS: We're going to go around the horn real quick. I'm going to go totally outside the box. I think she is unconventional. I don't think she's going to do anybody predictable. It's going to be a country star. It's going to be like Zach Bryan--SEANA SMITH: That would be a curveball.DAVID BRIGGS: --or Zac Brown Band.JOSH SHAFER: Chris Stapleton stays after the National Anthem?DAVID BRIGGS: Oh, that'd be amazing, my favorite singer of all time. But I think someone-- Sugarland, someone like that. Unconventional, brings in a different portion of the audience.SEANA SMITH: I've got to agree with Allie. I was going to go JAY-Z before we even heard her pick. I think that makes the most sense. We know he has shown a little bit of resistance against the Super Bowl halftime show in the past. I would not be surprised if we see him on that stage on Sunday.JOSH SCHAFER: They always make fun of on the sports shows when everyone picks the same team, right, and we all have the same little icon on the bottom. Because I'm going to pick JAY-Z too.SEANA SMITH: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: So that's when they normally say that's not going to happen. But I don't know. It's my favorite song. ""Run This Town"" is my favorite song. JAY-Z is, obviously, very involved, as Allie said. So that was my pick before everyone else picked. So we've got to stay with it.SEANA SMITH: All right, I like ""Umbrella.""DAVID BRIGGS: Wow.ALLIE CANAL: She's predicting ""Umbrella.""SEANA SMITH: ""Ella-ella-ella.""ALLIE CANAL: ""Umbrella"" as a finale-- I could see a bunch of umbrellas out there.SEANA SMITH: Yes, exactly. It could be a good one. We'll see.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, I like that.SEANA SMITH: Clearly, we are very excited for the halftime show. David, you've got to jump on board here, you know?DAVID BRIGGS: I am, man.SEANA SMITH: We're going to get you to become a Rihanna fan.ALLIE CANAL: He's such a boomer. Dave is a boomer.SEANA SMITH: Sooner rather than later.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm gonna be honest, that's when I get my Buffalo chicken dip, man, whatever.SEANA SMITH: All right.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm here for the game.ALLIE CANAL: OK, boomer.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, thanks so much. Well, Apple, like we've been talking about, replacing Pepsi as the official sponsor for this year's Super Bowl halftime show. $250 million deal spans five years. This is according to the ""Sports Business Journal."" Let's discuss what this means for the tech giant.For that, we want to bring back Dan Ives, Wedbush managing director, its senior equity analyst. Dan, it's great to see you here. So, clearly, a huge move for Apple, now being the sponsor of the halftime show. How big of a win do you think it is for the company?Dan, I think you're muted. And we love the Eagles jersey, by the way. Got it?DAN IVES: OK, so part of what Cook and Cupertino are focused on is really on the NFL and live sports. And this is an important part of, ultimately, what we see Apple doing more and more of over the coming years. I think it's a huge win. And especially in this macro period, Apple doing this further flexes the muscles.SEANA SMITH: Dan, when you talked about Apple here going forward, I think lots of questions just about the amount of money that they have spent or are going to spend on the halftime shows over the next several years. When you see that, does that make sense for them, given the fact that there's no guaranteed return on this type of investment?DAN IVES: But Apple, they're tacticians in terms of how they spend. And this is something they don't just do quickly. And if you look at the history, I mean, they have basically made big bets that have been home successes. And I also I think at this juncture, it's very important that they're investing at a time where some others maybe be are pulling back. And I think that's an important time, especially going into more iPhone launches as well as some other technologies I'd expect them to introduce over the coming months.DAVID BRIGGS: You thought they were going to take a big swing at the Sunday NFL Ticket package. What happened there? Did they end up making a bid? Did it just get out of the range they wanted to spend? And do you think they'll take another pass at an NBA, NFL type of property?DAN IVES: Yeah, and, look, I think there was significant involvement. I think some reports have talked about it. I just think it got to a point where they're only going to spend a certain amount. Ultimately, they were not going to go to that level.But live sports is the key to streaming. I mean, that is one of the keys for Apple when it comes to the streaming piece. I don't think they're stopping here. I think they're going to go after major sports over the coming years. When you look at that content strategy, I mean, it just further highlights whether it's streaming in terms of on TV or what we see with Apple Music, services, under the radar, has actually morphed into a pretty massive business.DAVID BRIGGS: How much will live sports mean for this tech battle? We just discussed Apple. You've got Google who made the big play for Sunday NFL Ticket, $2 and 1/2 billion a year, rumored to be per year, and then Amazon, of course, already in with Thursday Night Football. Or is it not that important in terms of the overall growth investor story?DAN IVES: I think it's a golden jewel, I mean, in terms of what big tech is focused on with streaming. Live sports is what is ultimately-- and that's why the value continues to go up. Because that's just traditional media. I think big tech is going to take significant bets on live sports over the coming year, especially as you look into '23, '24, '25, '26, a lot sort of come up for renewal. And I think streaming is going to be a big part of that over the coming years.SEANA SMITH: Dan, we don't have to ask you who you're rooting for, very clear. Got to ask you about the score. What do you think it's going to be on Sunday?DAN IVES: I see Eagles by 10.SEANA SMITH: OK.DAN IVES: I think, ultimately, yeah, I think between Hurts and that defense, I see a lot of happy fans in the 215 area code.SEANA SMITH: I hope you are right. 215 area code is my hometown. Dan Ives, great to see you. Thanks so much.DAN IVES: Thank you.SEANA SMITH: All right, Josh has another bet that he's watching over there. What do you got now, Josh?JOSH SCHAFER: All right, guys, we've got the coin toss now. You can bet on a 50/50 coin toss. I know, how exciting, right? But people will do it.And we asked our viewers what they picked. And they like heads. We had 55% or just about 55% of people say that they would vote heads or bet heads. But then when you look actually at where the money is right now at a place like Caesars Sportsbook, the money's on tails.58% of people betting on tails. You can see the odds right there, -102 and -102. Of course, even odds because, again, it's a 50/50 bet. Now, if you want to go fun stats, four out of the last five Super Bowls were heads.DAVID BRIGGS: That is nice research.SEANA SMITH: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: So I don't know if that makes you think your tails is due or--SEANA SMITH: What would you bet, Josh?JOSH SCHAFER: I would go heads.SEANA SMITH: You would go heads?JOSH SCHAFER: Yes, in a former life, I did the coin toss all the time. I always went heads. You've got to play the same one every time. I think you have to do a strategy on a 50/50.SEANA SMITH: Stick with it.DAVID BRIGGS: Real quickly, I want your pick with the spread. It's Philly by 1 and 1/2. Who do you got?JOSH SCHAFER: Dave, I have a lot of bets set up. Why don't we talk about that in about 10 minutes?DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, all right. Nice tease.JOSH SCHAFER: Coming up next, the Super Bowl ad landscape is getting a makeover. Find out why sports betting platforms like FanDuel could be a winning bet on Sunday.[MUSIC PLAYING]- It's called the kick of destiny.- What the heck is kick of destiny?- Good luck. See you in Phoenix. Don't miss.- Oh, boy.DAVID BRIGGS: Oh, it's going to be live, 45 yard field goal for Gronk FanDuel's Kick of Destiny campaign starring Rob Gronkowski, getting plenty of buzz ahead of the big game. Who else is getting bang for their 7 million bucks? John Connors is the co-founder and CEO of marketing and communications agency Boathouse. He joins us now. John, good to see you, man.So last year was labeled the Crypto Bowl. How significant a presence is gambling making? Did they replace crypto?JOHN CONNORS: Yeah, I think to your point, this year is going to be the-- you know, the booze, chips, and gambling bowl all combined. And I love the fact that you led with Gronk.SEANA SMITH: Well, speaking of it being the booze, chips, and gambling bowl, let's talk about the gambling aspect of it with the booze. Because Molson Coors is back in the Super Bowl after more than 30 years. They're teaming up with DraftKings. And what's interesting about this initiative is that they're allowing users to bet on who they think, for example, what beer is going to appear first, what dog is going to be used in the commercial. From your perspective, just the engagement aspect of this, how smart is that? And what do you think we'll hear from other alcohol brands this Sunday?JOHN CONNORS: Yeah, I mean, I think, to your point, you can't separate gambling from the Super Bowl, right? And so the ability to make that brand connection and to get that engagement, these days, everyone's trying to figure out how they can drive up that engagement value, how they can drive up that social value, how they can drive up the conversation. And so I think FanDuel and DraftKings have done masterful jobs, sort of between the Gronk bet and the betting on Coors Miller and all the other pieces of driving up as much conversation as possible.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, the live element of the FanDuel ad, have we ever seen anything like that? And how big do you think that will pay off?JOHN CONNORS: I think we've seen things like that, but not in the Super Bowl, right? So I think at this level, I mean, I think you've seen a lot of categories try and launch a lot of new ideas all the way back to Apple in 1984. It's always a massive platform for new launches. And I think as those two exchange blows to sort of capture attention, capture volume, I think it's a masterful play.SEANA SMITH: Well, John, for the big ads, they're pricing out just around $7 million for 30 seconds. We're seeing many companies team up. Like we've been talking about one GM and Netflix in this ad starring Will Ferrell.WILL FERRELL: General Motors is going electric. And Netflix is joining by including more EVs in their movies and shows. The least they can do. So, if you're going to get swarmed by an army of the dead, why not get swarmed in an EV? Ew. I said no biting.- Oh.WILL FERRELL: Or if you're being voluntarily kidnapped, why not be kidnapped in an EV? What's that scent? Is it pine?SEANA SMITH: So GM teaming up with Netflix, trying to push their EVs to make them more mainstream. What do you think of this strategy, a big streamer teaming up with an automaker?JOHN CONNORS: I think you're seeing-- well, last year's automakers were an interesting strategy. It was majority of electric vehicles when none of them had the electric vehicles yet. So they were all teasing sort of what was coming down the road. I think you're seeing that collaboration piece across the Super Bowl this year. I think, you know, the marketers like to follow the artists. And the artists have been doing collabs for a long time.And I think we're just seeing a significant number. As you know as well, there's a little more safety in a collaboration. Sort of two teams, two big brands like Netflix and GM going at it together just drives it a little bit more safety for that chief marketing officer.SEANA SMITH: All right, John Connors, thanks so much for joining us. I know a lot of us are very excited for all the ads that we will be seeing in just two days from now.JOHN CONNORS: Go Eagles.SEANA SMITH: Well, coming up, the Super Bowl Indicator. We'll tell you how stocks may perform next week based on the big game's outcome. Stay with us.[MUSIC PLAYING]JOSH SCHAFER: Welcome back to our Super Bowl special here on Yahoo Finance. Normally, we talk plenty about market indicators on this show, like a 100-day moving average or how stocks perform in election years. But some say even sports can tell us where Mr. Market is headed over the next year. Ryan Detrick over at Carson Research recently released the latest data for what's known as the Super Bowl Indicator, which tells us how markets perform depending on the outcome of the big game.So let's keep it simple to start. Markets have historically performed better after a team from the NFC conference wins than if the AFC wins. You can see here that's 10% for the NFC, an average return 6.9% for the AFC. So, really, people should be rooting for this indicator for the Eagles, who are in the NFC. That would give us a better return per the data.Now that was a historical chart, of course, going all the way back and counting all outcomes. But both these teams have also won Super Bowls in the past. So the Eagles have won one Super Bowl just a couple of years ago. And the S&amp;P 500 fell 6.2% that year.The Chiefs have won two Super Bowls. When you average those together, that's up 8.1%. So not a lot to take there, only three games. I don't think that's my favorite one. Let's get to my favorite one.Market bulls should really be rooting for a blowout on Sunday. So if you take a look here, the average return of the S&amp;P 500 is 8.5%. Now, when there's a single-digit win in the Super Bowl, it goes up 4.9% on average. When there's a double-digit win in the Super Bowl, it goes up 10.9% on average. But when there's a blowout and someone wins by 21 points or more, there's a blowout in the markets too. And the S&amp;P 500 rises on average 13.6% that year.So I don't know about you guys, I might root for an Eagles blowout on Sunday.SEANA SMITH: Heck yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Maybe my 401(k) can recover from last year a little bit.DAVID BRIGGS: Philly fan here is going to root for that. That will not happen. They could have a comfortable win, but not a blowout win.JOSH SCHAFER: Well, keep that thought.DAVID BRIGGS: Where is the public money at?JOSH SCHAFER: The public money? Let's take a look at the public money, Dave. So we know the spread is 1 and 1/2, right, coming into this game. So the Eagles are favored by 1 and 1/2. And the public money right now is on the Eagles.So 69% of the handle on DraftKings Sportsbook is currently on the Eagles to cover that 1 and 1/2 point spread. So that means they'd have to win by 2. And then where I really want to bet on Sunday, I think, because I love the totals, is 51. So 51 is the total. And that's where people are betting right now.Here's my favorite bet, though. Travis Kelce, first touchdown. I bet it earlier in the playoffs. It hit. I love the first touchdown bets. It's really exciting to watch the first couple drives and see it. Plus 700, I'm all over it, Dave.Seana, what are you watching on Sunday? Give us a bet. You've got to give us a pick.SEANA SMITH: All right, well, I went in with a parlay. And I stole this from Ross Tucker, full disclosure. But I've got to give credit where credit's due. And I liked it. I liked it a lot.So let's talk about it. I think Jalen Hurts is going to score a touchdown. I think Haason Reddick is also going to get a sack. And I also think that the Eagles are going to win. And I'm confident in it.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, Tucker's a pretty good gambler. He's no dummy. I've got a dumb bet. Because these are dumb bets when you have multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple things that have to happen. Patrick Mahomes over 1 and 1/2 touchdowns, Travis Kelce over 50 yards, AJ Brown over 50 yards, DeVonta Smith-- receiver for the Eagles-- under 63 and 1/2 yards, and Jalen Hurts over 40 yards rushing. Full disclosure, I also stole mine from a 15-year-old who lives in my house. But he's pretty good at this.JOSH SCHAFER: It seems like we bet a lot on the ankle injuries there and the lower extremities. How healthy is Jalen Hurts? How healthy is Patrick Mahomes? To talk football a little bit, I'm nervous about some of those prop bets. I've heard some--DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, you don't like it? You don't like it?JOSH SCHAFER: I don't know.DAVID BRIGGS: Well, look, the thing-- now, I say a dumb bet because those have such tremendous odds that they lure in a lot of people because they pay off well. But no one ever wins them.JOSH SCHAFER: They have the highest hold rate for sportsbooks. Sportsbooks want you to bet those same game parlays because they make the most money off of them. But coming up, we're talking about inflation. It's crashing your Super Bowl party. Find out how much you'll need to shell out for food and drinks when we come back.[MUSIC PLAYING]SEANA SMITH: What good is watching football if you don't have a bevy of snacks and also drinks to enjoy during the big game? But this year, you've got to keep a very close eye on that price tag. Because when it comes to checkout, some fan favorites are much pricier than they've been in years past. Allie Canal joining us now with a closer look at what we will be paying this weekend. Allie, what do you got?ALLIE CANAL: Wow, the good news is, Seana, if you want some chicken wings-- which we have on our set now-- that's actually cheaper, 22% cheaper compared to this time last year, $2.65 versus $3.38 per pound the week of Super Bowl 2022. And that's due to a larger supply of wings, decreased freight costs, all of that driving prices lower. And if you want to get a little bit fancier than wings, we have sirloin steak prices. That's also down by about $1 per pound. I feel like you really are a steak guy, Philly cheesesteak maybe?DAVID BRIGGS: Not during the Super Bowl.SEANA SMITH: Philly cheesesteak--ALLIE CANAL: Philly cheesesteak, though-- I think that could be an option.JOSH SCHAFER: You can't have a steak during the Super Bowl.ALLIE CANAL: I know, so you probably want to stick with the wings. Plus, 22% versus, you know, versus the $1 less, I think you go with the wings here. But chips and guac, avocados, they're also down, which is nice. But something that's up is your beer, 11% higher.SEANA SMITH: Wow.DAVID BRIGGS: And they've seen demand slip because of that towards the end of the year, yeah.ALLIE CANAL: And I think it's interesting too that soft drinks as well, they're up 25% So it's actually cheaper to get a little buzz going than just stay sober during the game. But we were talking about--SEANA SMITH: You need another reason to go out and get a drink during the big game.JOSH SHAFER: In the spirit of that--ALLIE CANAL: In the spirit of that, but talking about spirits, though, that's actually only up 2% while wine is up 3%. So maybe a little sangria action if you don't want the beer. That's a cheaper option.DAVID BRIGGS: Not bad.ALLIE CANAL: But, overall, I think for the Super Bowl people, people want to drink their beer.DAVID BRIGGS: Wings versus boneless wings, Allie. You are the expert. We have them both here. Seana and I are team boneless.SEANA SMITH: We are.ALLIE CANAL: I'm not Team Boneless. I am--SEANA SMITH: We're on a little island by ourselves.ALLIE CANAL: I'm bone-in, but I'm flats over drumsticks all day.SEANA SMITH: Oh, yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah.SEANA SMITH: What about you?JOSH SCHAFER: No, I'm absolutely bone-in. I am of the take that if you have boneless wings, they're actually just--ALLIE CANAL: That just looks sad.JOSH SCHAFER: --those are chicken nuggets. Those are chicken nuggets. Those are chicken nuggets.DAVID BRIGGS: Josh, Seana, Allie--SEANA SMITH: I will eat them all to myself.DAVID BRIGGS: --thank you, guys. That'll do it for our big game coverage. Enjoy the weekend. Enjoy the Super Bowl. And we'll see you on Monday.ALLIE CANAL: Go Birds.]"

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Target’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Target Is Target Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Target is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $268.98, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Target’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Target?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Target's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 57%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since TGT is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TGT for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy TGT. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

79,042a1cd3-bbd3-3cf7-9144-6b9601ace1af,MAR,2023-02-12,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-051614829.html,1676178974,STORY,"['PA=F', 'NG=F', 'PL=F', 'GC=F']","[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com -- Who will call whose bluff? After two months of being squeezed by the Group of Seven’s crude price cap, Vladimir Putin’s regime has apparently had enough, saying it will cut its oil production - just as the European Union follows the United States in banning all forms of Russian energy while the G7 instituted another cap on Russian fuel prices.Russia will slash its oil production by 5%, or 500,000 barrels per day, from March, Deputy Prime Minister and de facto energy minister Alexander Novak announced on Friday.“Russia believes the price cap mechanism for selling Russian oil and oil products interferes with market relations,” Novak said. “It continues the destructive energy policy of the countries of the collective west.”OPEC+, the alliance of 23 oil producers that Saudi Arabia leads with Russia’s assistance, has nothing to do with the cuts planned by Russia, Novak said - just in case the Biden administration seems to think the House of Saud is once again helping its comrade-in-distress Putin to weaponize energy.The United States singled out the Saudis for criticism last year when OPEC+ announced a 2-million-bpd cut in October, which was seen by Washington as an outright attempt to bolster Russia’s war against Ukraine. Instead of being helpful, the OPEC+ cut was a prelude to a 9% drop in crude prices between November and January as Chinese demand for oil tanked from COVID-19 restrictions and fears of a global recession spiked.Aside from Novak’s announcement on Friday, Reuters, citing energy industry officials in Moscow, reported that the Kremlin plans to set a fixed $20 per barrel differential for its Urals crude to dated contracts of global benchmark Brent for “tax purposes”.Russia currently uses Urals price assessments in Europe's Rotterdam and Augusta ports, provided by commodity price reporting agency Argus, to determine its mineral extraction tax, additional income tax, oil export duty and reverse excise on oil.Story continuesAccording to data issued by the finance ministry in Moscow, the average price of its Urals in January was $49.48 a barrel, down 42% from January 2022.“The ‘Empire Strikes Back’ is what I’d call it, in this case, the Russian empire,” Phil Flynn, an energy analyst and self-proclaimed oil bull at Chicago’s Price Futures Group, told Investing.com.“Putin is betting that the West is going to need all these energy products they are shutting themselves off from and that ultimately they will hurt more from these sanctions, despite the hurt they want to cause Russia. It’s a question of who calls whose bluff.”Knowing the Russians’ aggressiveness when they are pushed to the wall, Flynn says Moscow’s response could play out in ways that the West might not like.In his energy market note on Friday, Flynn said Russian deputy premier Novak did not only announce the production cut or reiterate Moscow’s stand that it will not sell oil to any country that directly or indirectly adheres to the G7 cap.“Novak also warned, in what could be a veiled threat, that the price caps could be applied to other global economic sectors,” Flynn wrote. “That could be a threat to grain and perhaps platinum and palladium that the Biden administration will need in its push for electric cars. Russia is the world’s top producer of palladium and the world’s second-largest producer of platinum.”“There is also a threat that Russia’s aggressive attitude could block Ukrainian grain exports in what will be a much smaller Ukrainian crop.”The G7 responded swiftly to the Russian announcements, cautioning oil consumers that Moscow might be trying to pull off a stunt. “It is critical not to take Russian statements about oil production cuts at face value,” Reuters quoted a G7 Price Cap Coalition official as saying.Historically, OPEC+ countries have often put out more crude than they said, although under-investment in oil fields since the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to produce like before.“Global energy markets remain stable, with benchmarks largely unchanged since the implementation of the crude cap in December,” the G7 official said. “According to public reporting, a large volume of Russian seaborne oil was delivered via price cap-compliant tankers.”The official added that the price cap - of $60 per barrel on Russian crude and at $100 on diesel and $45 on fuel oil and naphtha - “continues to meet its dual objectives”.The U.S. Treasury Department has repeatedly said that it wants to limit what the Kremlin can earn per barrel in order to squeeze Moscow’s funding for the war in Ukraine, while ensuring Russian oil supplies reach markets that needed them.On that score, the G7 official said “any Russian production cuts will disproportionately hurt developing countries”.Besides the G7 response, the economic data out of Moscow shows the Russian economy teetering into riskier waters as Putin pushes to somehow win a war he began almost a year ago and which has isolated his country from most of the world.Russia's current account surplus hit a record high in 2022, as a fall in imports and robust oil and gas exports kept foreign money flowing in despite Western efforts to isolate the Russian economy over the conflict in Ukraine.But Moscow is now contending with sharply lower export revenues, down 35.1% year-on-year in January, in part due to price caps and embargoes on Russian oil and gas products.Energy revenues were particularly low in January, down 46.4%. The slumping revenues, combined with soaring expenditure, pushed Russia's federal budget to a deficit of 1.76 trillion roubles ($24.2 billion) in the first month of the year.Lower export volumes saw Russia's current account surplus shrink 58.2% to $8 billion in January, the central bank said on Thursday, squeezing Russia's capital buffers at a time when Moscow is ramping up budget spending.The current account, a measure of the difference between all money coming into a country through trade, investment and transfers, and what flows back out, stood at $19.1 billion in January 2021.Demand-wise as well, Russian energy has pretty much only two buyers now: India and China.“At this point, having choked Indian and Chinese refineries with so much oil in recent months, the Russians might have to wait out the next round of demand from these refiners, who, don’t forget, are re-exporting part of the Russian crude they are buying as finished fuel products,” John Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, told Investing.com.“So, India and China, besides their own consumption, need to find end-markets for the Russian oil they are buying as well. Yes, the rock-bottom Russian crude prices have been great for the profits of Indian and Chinese refiners. But now, they may have reached an inflection point for demand. Everyone’s competing for that same Asian market share. So, the Russian production cut here might be a forced situation, rather than a voluntary one.”Despite typically holding a negative bet against oil, Kilduff concedes that there could be some near-term pressure on energy consumers from the mind games played by Russia and the West.“From the consumers’ perspective, everything has to go perfectly for prices to continue staying flat to lower,” Kilduff said. “I liken it sort of to the New York City commuter traffic. Tons of volume goes through, you get to work pretty much fine every day. But you have one little accident, and now you’re looking at an hour-and-a-half to get across to the George Washington Bridge.”But all said, the G7 and the White House seem “pretty happy with the way their price cap has worked”, said Kilduff.“The Russians have been yelling from the rooftops that the cap is ‘stupid’. But the fact of the matter is it has succeeded in forcing them to sell to the lowest bidders in India and China. And they are hurting from that.”“Also, we are in a flat demand period ahead of the pick-up for summer. The market shouldn’t really be missing the Russian barrels right now.”Oil: Market Settlements and Activity Oil markets jumped as Russia hit back at the G7’s price caps by announcing production cuts and its own minimum price structure.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March did a final trade of $79.76 per barrel on Friday, after officially settling the session at $79.72, up $1.66, or 2.1%. The session high was $80.33, its loftiest since Jan. 30.For the week, the U.S. crude benchmark was up almost 9%, overwriting the previous week’s 7.5% plunge.London-traded Brent crude for March delivery had a final trade of $86.52 after finishing the regular session at $86.39, up $1.89, or 2.2%. The session peak was $86.90.Brent was up 8% on the week, erasing the previous week’s 7.5% decline.Oil plunged the previous week on the back of recession fears and uncertainty in U.S. interest rates' direction after bumper job and wage gains among Americans in January threatened to bump up inflation.During the week in review, oil rebounded on the premise that Chinese refiners would add exponentially to imports this month as the country returns from the long Lunar New Year break and into an environment free of COVID-19 restrictions which had previously hampered demand.However, Chinese import data supporting such a market run-up will likely not emerge for weeks. Latest available data showed the world’s largest crude importer bought 10.98 million bpd, or barrels per day, in January, down from December's 11.37M bpd and November's 11.42M bpd.Running counter to the just-ended week’s bullish sentiment in oil were large builds across the board in crude, gasoline and distillates in the Weekly Petroleum Status Report released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.Oil: Price OutlookWTI’s long consolidation within $72.25 support and $82.65 resistance creates a potential price range with a $10 sideplay, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.Though WTI’s daily chart shows the possibility of a bullish continuation, with the RSI, or Relative Strength Index, at 54 - positioned above neutrality of 50 - the confluence of the 50-Day EMA, or Exponential Moving Average, with the Daily Middle Bollinger Band calls for caution, Dixit said.“The market will prefer to monitor reaction to the 100-Day SMA (Simple Moving Average) of $81.08, followed by the horizontal resistance of $82.70 for any breakout and retest, before taking a broader bullish call.”Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The selloff in natural gas paused Friday, with the market posting its first weekly gain in eight, as bears in the market reassessed their positions after taking the heating fuel to 2-½ year lows in the previous session.The front-month March gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.580 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units on Friday, Investing.com data showed. The official settlement for the session was $2.514, up 6.9 cents, or 2.8%.For the week, the benchmark U.S. gas contract rose 4.3%, posting its first weekly gain since the week ended Dec. 9. Gas futures lost a cumulative 63% in seven weeks prior to that.On Thursday, March gas fell to $2.351, plumbing the lowest level for a front-month gas contract on the Henry Hub since Sept. 28, 2020, when the benchmark contract then went down to $2.02.An unusually warm start to the 2022/23 winter season has led to considerably less heating demand in the United States versus the norm, leaving more gas in storage than initially thought.At the close of last week, U.S. gas-in-storage stood at 2.366 tcf, or trillion cubic feet, up 10.9% from the year-ago level of 2.133 tcf, data from the EIA, or Energy Information Administration, showed.Utilities drew a higher-than-forecast 217 bcf, or billion cubic feet, from storage for heating and electricity generation last week, the EIA said.Analysts tracked by Investing.com had expected a draw of 195 bcf for the week ended Feb. 3, above the consumption of 151 bcf seen in the prior week to Jan. 27.“The bullishness of the withdrawal was driven by colder-than-normal temperatures, especially at the end of the reflective storage week,” analysts at Houston-based energy markets consultancy Gelber &amp; Associates said. “However, improving imbalances such as this aren’t significantly meaningful when they’re not accompanied by a supportive temperature outlook.”Responding to the warmth and lackluster storage draws, gas prices plunged from a 14-year high of $10 per mmBtu in August, reaching $7 in December and mid-$2 levels this week amid forecasts for bitter cold here and there.Natural gas: Price OutlookNatural gas’ RSI and Stochastics lack signs of an end to its bearish correction despite prevailing oversold conditions, said Dixit of SKCharting.“The $2 support remains intact for now,” said Dixit. “But if the $2.35 support is broken followed by a failed $2.18, then another headlong plunge will follow.”On the other hand, temporary optimism may reflect on some weak shorts being covered, he said. “In this aspect, if $2.68 is breached, followed by a breakout reaching $2.989, then the upside could stretch.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold for April delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,876.50 on Friday, after officially settling the session at $1,874.50, down $4 or 0.2%.For the week, however, April gold was up 0.6%.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled on Friday at $1,865.93, up $4.19, or 0.2%. For the week, the spot price was virtually flat.Gold: Price Outlook Going further into next week, spot gold’s sustainability above $1,856 will help it get some bounce towards $1,872 and $1,878 - which is a critical barrier to cross over to the further resistance zone of $1,886 and $1,893, said Dixit.“Sustainability below $1,856 will prompt a quick retest of $1,852, which is the acceleration point for a further drop to $1,842 and $1,832, with our own bearish target of $1,828, which coincides with the 38.2% Fibonacci level,” he added.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related Articles'The grass does not grow': In Chile's far south, the worst drought in 50 yearsOil prices rise over 2% on Russian plan to cut output]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 countries that produce the best athletes in the world.Sports has always fascinated people, from thousands of years ago to today. While fame has always been a given for athletes, with the level of fame depending on the popularity of the sport they've engaged in, the world of sports has changed significantly in the last century especially in terms of money. Half a century ago, only players at the very top of the game earned handsome salaries with most of the other players not earning more than the average person.15 countries that produce the best athletes in the worldNowadays, every corner of the world is inundated with sporting events including World Cups of different sports, with the most popular by far being the FIFA World Cup for football. The latest event was held in Qatar, which spend billions officially on ensuring that the World Cup was a massive success, which it did end up being. With the popularity of such sports, many sporting companies have become multi-billion dollar empires and provide sponsorships to top athletes to ensure that their name is out there front and center, with such companies including NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), which is worth nearly $200 billion currently and is the biggest sporting company in the world, Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UA) and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU).These companies have realized the massive potential and returns that they can earn in the sporting world, with NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) arguably being the most successful company in this field. For many countries, their sporting market is an important part of their influence and an excellent source of revenue as well, as can seen in England where the England Premier League brings in revenues worth billions of pounds and is the highest-earning football league in the world. In the U.S., while most popular sports such as baseball, basketball and American football are popular in the country alone, they still bring in some of the highest revenue for any sports leagues in the world because of the American obsession with these sports. This is why some of the most valuable sports companies in the world are American sports teams. This is why many nations are investing heavily in discovering and supporting athletes, especially the countries that produce the best athletes in the world.Story continuesWhile many are calling out the sports world for exorbitant values and paying unbelievable salaries to athletes, changes seem unlikely considering the ever increasing demand for sports by spectators and the revenue that TV streaming rights provide to various sporting leagues. That's why many people consider sports clubs as investment opportunities. After all, Chelsea Football Club, one of the most successful football clubs in the world in the last two decades, was sold for £4.25 billion in 2022. 19 years ago, Roman Abramovich bought the club for a reported £140 million. That is a return of over 3,000% in 19 years. Sales of Liverpool Football Club and Manchester United plc (NYSE:MANU), the two most successful English football clubs in history, which are seeming more likely as time passes by, will also see huge returns for owners.To determine the countries that produce the best athletes, we couldn't focus on any one sport as many nations participate in different competitions and have superiority over the other in different competitions. This is why the Olympics were the best option for our ranking, as the Olympics have hundreds of events across all sports and athletics, showcasing the best from each country in various fields. The Olympics are interesting from an economical point of view as massive costs to host the Olympics continue to increase while benefits are uncertain, leaving countries with a massive loss which is why fewer countries are now bidding to host one of the most prestigious competitions in the world. According to a 2012 study by the University of Oxford, from 1976 to 2012, the average cost overrun for each Summer Olympics is around 252%. Despite this, over 250 companies advertise in the Olympics even though companies which aren't official partner of the Olympics aren't even allowed to use the term ""Olympics"".  We obtained data for the last 3 Olympic events, and combined each country's haul in gold, silver and bronze medals, assigning 50% weightage to each country's ranking for total gold medals, 30% weightage to each country's ranking for total silver medals, and 20% weightage to each country's ranking for total bronze medals. So, without further, ado, let's take a look at the athletic nations, starting with:15. SpainTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 14Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 22Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 18Spain has ensured that it is counted among the best sporting countries in the world through meticulous planning and execution. Surprisingly, despite the U.S. dominating basketball over almost a century, winning 16 of 19 tournaments in the Summer Olympics, Spain is currently ranked as the top team in basketball according to the International Basketball Federation.14. HungaryTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 22Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 14Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 17Hungary has excelled in sports where there are multiple opportunities of winning medals, which is why despite a small population, it has collected over 50 medals in the last 3 Olympics.13. New ZealandTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 17Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 17Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 17New Zealand has the smallest population by far among countries in our list, which is why it is amazing that it is still counted among the countries that produce the best athletes.12. BrazilTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 17Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 17Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 23The most successful country in athletics in Latin America, the culture in Brazil regarding sports is one of the main reasons behind the country's success.11. NetherlandsTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 24Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 25Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 26Despite a smaller population especially relative to most other countries in the list of the countries that produce the best athletes, a strong national coordination of activities has ensured that the Dutch continue to produce top athletes, with the government spending tens of millions of euros each year to ensure development of top talent in various sports.10. South KoreaTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 28Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 16Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 27One of the most successful country in athletics in Asia, South Korea is easily among the countries that produce the best athletes in the world. However, the country is also emerging among the best in the world of esports, which is an industry with massive growth potential and could be ripe for potential investment.9. ItalyTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 26Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 31Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 39Sports in Italy have had a long, storied tradition and while it is the second most successful football team in the world with four World Cups and are the current reigning European champions, Italy has also made a successful foray into various other sports with its men and women's teams considered to be among the best in the world.8. FranceTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 31Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 41Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 38Sports are part of France's culture and hosts some of the most prestigious sporting evens in the world including Tour de France and the French Open, while also winning the football World Cup in 2018. The country has also achieved significant success in the Olympics.7. AustraliaTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 33Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 33Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 44Australia is easily among the countries that produce the best athletes, having won over 100 medals in the last 3 Olympics. This success is despite a relatively smaller population of just over 22 million people, and in terms of medals per capita, it would be far ahead of even the U.S.6. GermanyTotal gold medals in last 3 Olympics: 38Total silver medals in last 3 Olympics: 41Total bronze medals in last 3 Olympics: 44Germany is one of the most successful football nations in the world, winning four World Cups and three Euros, but its success has extended to various other sports as well.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Countries that Produce the Best Athletes in the World. Suggested articles:12 Best Low Priced Dividend Stocks To Buy11 Most Undervalued Foreign Stocks To Buy15 Most Undervalued NASDAQ StocksDisclosure: None. 15 Countries that Produce the Best Athletes in the World is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

Though investors shouldn’t ignore the relatively boring option of dividend stocks to buy. True, companies that provide reliable passive income don’t generate much excitement. However, with so many variables ahead of the markets, a dull but dependable route may be more prudent.For this list of dividend stocks to buy, every company features a payout ratio – or the proportion of earnings a company pays its shareholders via dividends – below 70%. As well, each enterprise carries a consensus rating among analysts of moderate buy or its equivalent. That way, prospective investors can also enjoy capital gains potential.TXNTexas Instruments$176.50UPSUnited Parcel Service$186.36DOXAmdocs$95.21TSCOTractor Supply$231.24SNASnap-on$251.20JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$163.61CSCOCisco$46.96InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTexas Instrument (TXN)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comOne of the top technology firms in the nation, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally. So far, TXN has avoided the wild volatility that impacted its peers. In the trailing year, shares gained over 6%. In contrast, the Nasdaq Composite index dropped nearly 15% during the same period.Currently, Texas Instruments carries a forward yield of 2.7%. This ranks conspicuously above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Further, its payout ratio pings at 59.28%. As well, the company commands 19 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Therefore, it’s unlikely that management will give up this trend without a fight.Financially, Texas Instruments features a stable balance sheet (an Altman Z-Score of 12.85) and excellent profitability margins. These attributes may have contributed to Wall Street analysts rating TXN as a consensus moderate buy. Further, TipRanks notes that hedge fund sentiment rates as “positive.” Therefore, it offers a solid choice among dividend stocks to buy.Story continuesUnited Parcel Service (UPS)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA stalwart in the shipping and receiving industry, United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) represents a critical cog in the broader supply chain management complex. Admittedly, though, circumstances have been challenging for UPS amid 2022’s spike in inflation. However, the situation appears to be turning around, with shares gaining over 7% since the January opener.Presently, UPS carries a forward yield of 3.44%. This rates better than the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. Notably, the company’s payout ratio is 52.73%. In addition, UPS features 14 years of consecutive dividend increases.Despite wider challenges, UPS commands a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.4%, outpacing 75% of the competition. Also, its net margin stands at 11.51%, beating over 68% of its rivals.Turning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg UPS as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target is $194.94, implying potential upside of 3.53%. While not particularly exciting, UPS ranks among the dividend stocks to buy this year.Amdocs (DOX)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockA multinational software firm, Amdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) specializes in software and services for communications, media and financial services providers and digital enterprises. Contrary to many of its tech peers, Amdocs performed very well in 2022. For instance, in the trailing 365 days, DOX gained nearly 22%. It’s still up almost 4% since the January opener.At the moment, DOX carries a forward yield of 1.83%. Though not the highest yield, it still rates better than the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, Amdocs features a low payout ratio of 26.75%, meaning investors can depend on it for reliable passive income. Plus, the company enjoys 10 consecutive years of dividend increases.Financially, DOX might attract investors for its value proposition. The market prices shares at a forward multiple of 16.77. As a discount to forward earnings, Amdocs ranks better than 72%.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg DOX as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $99, implying 4% upside potential. Combined with its strong market performance, DOX represents one of the dividend stocks to buy.Tractor Supply (TSCO)7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right NowSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee, Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) is an American retail chain of stores that sells products for various purposes. These include home improvement, agriculture, lawn and garden maintenance, livestock, equine and pet care for recreational farmers and ranchers, pet owners, and landowners.Although a boring entry among dividend stocks to buy, Tractor did what it does best: keep the ship afloat. In the trailing year, shares gained nearly 5%. While not particularly impressive, it’s a heckuva lot better than falling into negative territory.Presently, Tractor Supply carries a forward yield of 1.58%. To be fair, this slips a bit below the consumer discretionary sector’s average yield of 1.89%. However, the payout ratio sits at 31.69%, making TSCO one of the more dependable dividend stocks to buy.Finally, Wall Street analysts assess TSCO as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target pings at $245.78, implying upside potential of almost 6%.Snap-on (SNA)dividend stocks: A calculator projecting the word ""DIVIDEND"" rests on a pile of gold and silver coins.Source: ShutterstockNot to be confused with the similar-sounding social media firm, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) is an American designer, manufacturer and marketer of high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry. These sectors included the automotive, heavy duty, equipment, marine, aviation and railroad industries.Though another boring behind-the-shadows example of dividend stocks to buy, SNA proves that boring can be profitable. In the trailing year, shares gained nearly 20% of equity value. Further, since the Jan. opener, SNA moved up 11%.At time of writing, Snap-on carries a forward yield of 2.55%. This rates higher than the consumer discretionary sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Further, the payout ratio sits at 36.65%, making it one of the reliable dividend stocks to buy. As well, Snap-on enjoys 13 years of consecutive dividend increases.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg SNA as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $281, implying upside potential of over 10%.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Source: ShutterstockFounded in 1886, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) represents an American icon. As a business enterprise, Johnson &amp; Johnson develops medical devices, pharmaceuticals and consumer packaged goods. However, JNJ hasn’t posted a great performance recently. In the trailing year, it fell nearly 5%. And since the January opener, JNJ faces a deficit of more than 8%.Nevertheless, this may open the door for contrarians to pick up one of the dividend stocks to buy on discount. Currently, the healthcare giant carries a forward yield of 2.77%. This ranks notably higher than the underlying sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Also, its payout ratio of 41.5% provides prospective investors with confidence. Lastly, regarding the passive income, it’s on a 61-year consecutive streak of dividend increases.Looking to Wall Street, analysts peg JNJ as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $186.11, implying upside potential of nearly 14%.Cisco Systems (CSCO)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in San Jose, California, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a digital communications technology conglomerate. Per its website, Cisco develops, manufactures, and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment and other high-technology services and products. However, CSCO hasn’t been a great performer last year. In the trailing 365 days, CSCO lost almost 14% of equity value.Even in the year so far, Cisco presently posts unimpressive numbers, slipping a few basis points below parity. Nonetheless, for bargain hunters, CSCO may be one of the best dividend stocks to buy. Currently, the company offers a forward yield of 3.18%. In contrast, the tech sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%. Moreover, the payout ratio offers confidence, coming in just under 40%. Lastly regarding dividends, it features 12 years of consecutive payout increases.Right now, analysts peg CSCO as a consensus moderate buy. Additionally, their average price target stands at $54.70, implying upside potential of over 14%.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.24.Does Verizon Communications Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Verizon Communications has a better ROE than the average (12%) in the Telecom industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . To know the 2 risks we have identified for Verizon Communications visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Verizon Communications' Debt And Its 24% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Verizon Communications, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.66. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Air Products and Chemicals'  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Air Products and Chemicals is:16% = US$2.3b ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.16 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Air Products and Chemicals' Earnings Growth And 16% ROETo start with, Air Products and Chemicals' ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 17%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 11% seen over the past five years by Air Products and Chemicals.Story continuesNext, on comparing Air Products and Chemicals' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 12% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Air Products and Chemicals''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Air Products and Chemicals Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?While Air Products and Chemicals has a three-year median payout ratio of 63% (which means it retains 37% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.Additionally, Air Products and Chemicals has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 54%. Regardless, the future ROE for Air Products and Chemicals is predicted to rise to 20% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Air Products and Chemicals' performance has been quite good. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

The big game is a billion dollar business. Major companies like T-Mobile (TMUS), Budweiser (BUD), General Motors (GM), Netflix (NFLX) and Uber (UBER) and set to spend millions of dollars to air a commercial during the broadcast. Betting will also take center stage, with over 50 million people expected to wager billions on sites like DraftKings (DKNG), MGM (MGM) and more.

We got an hour of big game coverage coming for you. The quarterback match-up-- Jalen Hurts versus Patrick Mahomes.SEANA SMITH: And we are talking to him Ndamukong Suh of the Eagles. A huge game on Sunday. He'll obviously be involved with that. We'll talk about the game, also, his investments. Fun fact, he's buddy-buddy with Warren Buffett.DAVID BRIGGS: And one analyst says Apple could win the Super Bowl. We'll tell you why. Also, how much it costs to go to the game and stay home, even to buy those chicken wings.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, those prices are racking up there. And, also, the number of people expected to bet on the Super Bowl-- 50 million Americans, one of the big prop bets, what's going to be the color of that Gatorade shower? What do you think?DAVID BRIGGS: I'm going red.SEANA SMITH: I'm going orange. I was going to go yellow. Reds a bold bet. I like it. We will see who the winner is.Story continues[MUSIC PLAYING]DAVID BRIGGS: Hey, everybody. Welcome into our Super Bowl LVII coverage. I'm Dave Briggs, alongside Seana Smith. Cannot wait for this game. We've got a lot coming your way over the next hour. I'm really excited for the game itself, but I want you to go first on what you're eyeing in the game, or outside the game.SEANA SMITH: Well, in the game-- I'm going to say an overall thing-- it's going to be the Eagles, my hometown team. I am very, very excited for them going for their second title in the last six years. Specific, Jalen Hurts, it's all about him. He's got to keep the momentum. I'm excited about that. Aside from the game, the halftime show. Apple is now going-- is the official sponsor of the show this year, taking over from Pepsi. Rihanna is back on the live music stage. I'm excited.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm just out of the loop on Rihanna. I'm sorry. I don't want to offend anybody. I just don't get it. But I know she's awesome. I'm excited because, look, I think the Eagles have a far superior roster. I do acknowledge that. But Andy Reid always has something interesting up his sleeve. Something you have never seen before, and Patrick Mahomes has that Harry-Potter-like wand. He has magic. I think they actually should be a 7 or an 8-point underdog. I think the Eagles are a much better team. But the Chiefs can really surprise you, but I'll be honest, what I'm really looking forward to is my only Super Bowl tradition, my wife's buffalo chicken dip. It's awesome. Like, that's all that matters for me on Super Bowl Sunday.SEANA SMITH: You're going to bring over the leftovers on Monday, then.DAVID BRIGGS: There won't be any, dude.SEANA SMITH: Well, maybe you should--DAVID BRIGGS: I'll be, like, scraping--SEANA SMITH: --leave a little bit--DAVID BRIGGS: --the bowl with my fingers when the chips run out.SEANA SMITH: I got to get the recipe after this show. All right, well, this might be the biggest Super Bowl yet for the gambling industry. Lots to look forward to this weekend. The American Gaming Association releasing its predictions for Super Bowl LVII, estimating that about 50 million Americans will bet roughly $16 billion on this year's game. That's more than double last year's total, but our own, Josh Schafer, has been looking further into this number, what it really means for the sportsbook operators. What do you got for us, Josh?JOSH SHAFER: That's right, Seana. So that's $16 billion number is, obviously, a massive number, but not all of that is going to go right to the sportsbook. So for starters, that number includes both bets placed legally and illegally. It's also an estimate. And if we take a look at last year's estimate, 7.61 billion translated to just $950 million of legal handle. That's according to the AGA's assessment of state data.So less than 15% of last year's estimation ended up as legal handle. Now, the total amount at legal books, and then if you have to think about how these sportsbooks make money, right? So you take that handle-- that legal handle, that $950 million and then you subtract what's known as the gross winning margin, or you multiply it by that gross winning margin, which is only 10% on average.Then when you multiply those, you end up only getting $95 million as the total legal handle-- or, sorry, the gross gaming revenue, which is what goes back to the sportsbooks. That's the number that ends up getting taxed, and that can be taxed, guys, at about an average of a 20% rate. So there are $95 million then taxed at 20%, it's just not quite as big as that $16 billion number we like to talk about all the time, but it is still a huge week, Dave. The stocks have been roaring headed into the Super Bowl. The three or four of the gambling stocks here over the last month, so it certainly is an exciting time.DAVID BRIGGS: You just took like an extra large pizza and boiled it down to one slice.JOSH SHAFER: But that slice could be delicious. That slice could be absolutely delicious.DAVID BRIGGS: And it's still a pretty solid slice. It's a New York-sized slice. But the game is not in New York. It's in Arizona. And that's the first time we've ever had a legal sports gambling state host a Super Bowl. What does that mean? What are the implications?JOSH SHAFER: Well, it means that people can bet well they're sitting in the stadium, right? And that's the biggest thing that we're going to be watching, and really what I want to point out here too is the tax rate. So Arizona taxes mobile betting at a 10% rate, and why I'm watching that number is because Arizona is probably going to have a higher handle this Sunday than they normally would. They're going to get a 10% rate on that. They're going to get a lot of state revenue, guys. And I'm curious how that leads moving forward. As we continue to see gambling grow, are more states going to want the Super Bowl to bring in a lot of gamblers, get people excited for the game and get more state revenue? Seems like a decent deal to me.DAVID BRIGGS: Where's the game next year? Vegas, baby. I mean--JOSH SHAFER: Not a bad place for gambling.DAVID BRIGGS: That seems like it'll work out well. Great stuff. 50. 50 million Americans expected to throw down $16 billion in bets on Super Bowl LVII. Let's dig into those numbers with DraftKings CEO, Jason Robins. Jason, good to see you, man. 33 states now legal. How big is this weekend for you guys compared to anything you've seen in the past? What are your expectations?JASON ROBINS: Oh, I mean, given the growth of the industry, this is almost certainly going to be our biggest Super Bowl ever. And hard to know, it's always-- we always have predictions around the office going in because it's such a fun time. But one thing we know is it's going to be a big day. We know it's going to be our biggest customer acquisition day, and we're all excited to see the results. By the way, I heard in the other set, you're betting on red for the Gatorade? Is that-- I hear that right?DAVID BRIGGS: Do I have the wrong color, bro?JASON ROBINS: Listen, I don't know, but somebody told me, and you should verify this because I did not verify myself that there has never been red Gatorade poured on the winning coach in the Super Bowl. So maybe this is the year, but just a little hot take for you to check out. And I could be totally wrong on that. It was something somebody told me, but you should check that out.DAVID BRIGGS: Betting scoop. I appreciate that, buddy. That is solid. I had my eye on like an Eagles Green, so I'm going to have to look at the odds here on DraftKings.SEANA SMITH: Jeez, I think I picked orange. Hopefully, my odds are a little bit better than what Dave is facing right now, but, Jason, you talk about the popularity of sports betting, certainly we have seen massive growth over the last several years. With the Super Bowl in Arizona, like we're talking about, the first state with statewide legalized sports gambling here, in terms of the number of users that you are expected to add, can you put a number on that?JASON ROBINS: We can. I mean, one, we actually have earnings next week. So I've got to be careful about saying anything like that, but, also, it's just tough to predict. I mean, so much comes in towards the end and the last day, and even in the last hours. And so hard to say, but I know that we think it'll be our biggest day ever, and that's been the case for the last three Superbowls, or last-- excuse me, four Super Bowls since legalized sports betting as well.JOSH SHAFER: Jason, I'm curious what you're seeing out of the live betting space. Obviously, I think it being in Arizona probably helps, right? With people being excited while they're at the game, to probably bet during the game while they're sitting in the stands. I know often we talk about that Europe number, right? Maybe getting to 70, 75% of all bets, or all handle being in that live betting space. Do you think we eventually get there? Or is that where things are headed? How have you sort of seen those trends?JASON ROBINS: You know, live betting continues to increase. I think whether we get there or higher or a little lower, I don't know. But I think it's going to continue to grow. I think more and more people are starting to see that you can make bets during the game. And that doesn't just mean things like what's the next play or something like that.Some people decide, hey, maybe at halftime, they want to double down on the bet they made before the game. Or maybe they want to switch sides or something like that. So lots of options throughout the game.We also, you mentioned Arizona. This is the first year since legalized sports betting outside of Nevada that you will have a Super Bowl in a state with legal sports betting. So really excited to see how that plays out. I agree with you. I think it's going to have a tremendous halo effect on the state.Because not only the people at the game, but all the people that are in Arizona that know that the Super Bowl is here and are paying attention. And we're doing everything we can to let all the people coming in from out of town know, hey, while you're here, you can make a bet. And I think you're going to see a lot of fans take us up on that.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, that is interesting. And next year it'll be the second in a row because it's in Vegas.JASON ROBINS: Yeah.DAVID BRIGGS: But in terms of the big picture, certainly all the momentum is on the side of the sports gambling. But those three big states are out there-- California, Texas, and Florida. What went wrong in California? And when do you see any of those three states turning legal?JASON ROBINS: Well, I mean, California, it's pretty simple. We had over $200 million in opposition spent against us. I think, you know, eight times maybe is close to that, the next biggest opposition spend of any campaign. So, you know, we were literally attacked with a barrage of ads, many of them pushing false narratives. But not much you can do in a short cycle. And people hear what they hear. And, unfortunately, I think some incorrect facts got out there.So, you know, I think, first, we're going to try to work with the tribes. Obviously, that's a much easier path than trying to fight them. And nobody wants that. We actually had in our ballot initiative revenue going to the tribes. We had tethering to the tribes. Everything had to flow through the tribes.And, you know, we're going to hopefully get another year, another, I guess, two years from now. Well, one year from now, we're going to be able to potentially take another shot. And I think we have to learn from last time and educate a little better and be smarter about it. So we'll see on that.One Texas is in play this year. I think there's a live bill that has a decent shot of advancing. We'll have to see. Obviously, a lot to play out in the legislative session. So, you know, I think those are the two biggest states.Florida, you mentioned also, you know, tribal state, so has some of the same dynamics. But in that case, it's really one tribe, the Seminoles. So, you know, trying to figure out a way to collaborate with them, I think.And, hopefully, that's where the industry is going. There's just more collaboration. And everybody realizes that a rising tide will lift all ships. And, you know, I think that's something that we're seeing slowly but surely to try and move towards. But still a lot of work to do there, and especially in those big states. They're big prizes. So there's obviously going to be a lot of interest and a lot of stakeholders.SEANA SMITH: All right, Jason Robins, CEO of DraftKings, always great to have you. Thanks so much. Have fun this weekend.JASON ROBINS: OK, thank you so much.SEANA SMITH: All right, well, Arizona, like we've been talking about, is hosting this year's Super Bowl. Hundreds of thousands of fans are already there, getting ready for the big game. Yahoo Finance contributor Kevin Cirilli is doing just that. And Kevin, I know you spoke with a lot of key voices down there. I've got to say, I'm very jealous. I wish I was in your shoes right now. Give us a lay of the land. What's it like down there in Arizona right now?KEVIN CIRILLI: Well, when the plane landed at Sky Harbor, I thought I was in Ireland. Because all I kept seeing was green. There are literally-- I mean, there's-- I've seen like maybe one or two Chiefs fans. But, I mean, it's all Eagles fans everywhere. So, I mean, I feel like I'm at home here in sunny Scottsdale. Camelback Mountain behind me, if you know the area.Look, I was at the Phoenix Open, the Waste Management Open earlier this week, which has really become a business private partnership, a public private partnership, really a hub that Jack Selby, who's the managing director for Peter Thiel's family, and he's got his own venture capitalist investing $110 million here in the state. He started this thing. And it's really gone global.And one of the folks he was able to get out there was governor Katie Hobbs, the newly-elected Democratic governor of Arizona. And she noted the economic impact that the Super Bowl, that the Phoenix Open that that's having on this state. Take a listen to what she told me on the 17th hole.KATIE HOBBS: It is huge. It is huge. We have 160,000 workers in our tourism and hospitality industry that are ready to welcome the visitors that are already here, making sure they have a great experience. That gets return visits. And that helps our economy. The last time we had the Super Bowl in 2015, the economic impact was over $700 million.- $700 million?KATIE HOBBS: Yeah, yeah With over 100,000 visitors. So we're expecting to top that. And the lasting benefits for our economy, because we've become sort of-- we have a great track record with these kind of big events. And it's just going to attract more of them in the future.KEVIN CIRILLI: So when you look at the numbers, last year alone, $24.2 billion worth in the sports and tourism industry contributed to Arizona's GDP. They're expecting that the Super Bowl alone will increase that number to more than $1,000,000,000. So you could see a five percentage increase in that regard.But a lot of economic development here outside of sports. The semiconductor chip manufacturing that's being conducted here in the state, something that President Biden talked about in his State of the Union address earlier this week. Remember, Intel, TSMC building their fab factories down here.The governor is excited about that. Jack Selby is excited about that. A lot happening. They're trying to give Austin a run for their money.DAVID BRIGGS: All right, quickly, I know you're a big fan. I know you think Philly is going to win. Give me a score. And what's the particular edge you think that Philly has over KC?KEVIN CIRILLI: All right, well, one, the fans. That's the edge, clearly. Two, they're going to essentially be playing in a home stadium. And, three, I'm thinking it'll be 27-24, Birds. I do think it's going to be a nail-biter. I heard you compare-- I heard you compare the Chiefs to Hogwarts. And I got to say, that is not the case, OK? Like the Eagles are Gryffindor, let me just put it that way. How's that?DAVID BRIGGS: First off, it was Patrick Mahomes is Harry Potter, has a bit of wizardry to him. Let's get it straight, Cirilli, all right?KEVIN CIRILLI: OK.DAVID BRIGGS: Good luck, brother. Enjoy it out there, OK?KEVIN CIRILLI: I appreciate it. That's awesome, awesome. I'll talk to you guys later. Thank you for having me.DAVID BRIGGS: All right, we're going to be taking a look now at some prop bets through the hour. Our Josh Schafer, he is our resident junky gambler. And he's going to break it down for us. I need some prop action. So what do you got?JOSH SCHAFER: We've got some fun ones here for you guys. We're going to start with Gatorade, which sounds like it's a hot topic for you two. And--DAVID BRIGGS: Yep.SEANA SMITH: Yes.JOSH SCHAFER: --I'm not going to lie, where did we pick? Who had red? Someone had red, right?DAVID BRIGGS: I took red.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, all right, you're with 8% of the handle here. That's plus 450 odds, Dave. So what you're looking at is where people are betting. So the most bet on Gatorade is yellow. 40% of the money is on yellow. And then you've got 20% of the money on blue, 20% of the money on orange.SEANA SMITH: That's my pick.JOSH SCHAFER: My pick-- I've got to step out of the way here-- is purple. Because I think Riptide Rush is the best Gatorade. And that's simply all I'm picking off of. There is some fun stats, if you guys want to go deep into this, right? Orange is the most picked. That's probably why Seana picked it. It's come up the most times since 2001.SEANA SMITH: I did my research.JOSH SCHAFER: And then yellow is also very popular right now among Eagles fans. So yellow was poured on Doug Pederson at the NFC Championship and the Super Bowl the last time the Eagles won. And Nick Sirianni two weeks ago had yellow Gatorade poured on him.DAVID BRIGGS: Oh.SEANA SMITH: I love that flavor.JOSH SCHAFER: We like yellow.DAVID BRIGGS: That's a solid scoop. There are some of these colors, Josh, that are a little bit in between, that there's like a greenish-blue. You know what I mean, that greenish-blue Gatorade.JOSH SCHAFER: Green-blue, well, we've got yellow-green.DAVID BRIGGS: Right, I'm looking at it--JOSH SCHAFER: We're going to have to call back up Jason Robins--SEANA SMITH: You're the one that's disputing the color of Gatorade.JOSH SCHAFER: --and dispute what color you had. Because yellow-green is the only unclear one here. Then you've got red-pink.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, that would be pretty clear.DAVID BRIGGS: But like, pink?SEANA SMITH: That's going to be a tough one to argue with.DAVID BRIGGS: Is that even a Gatorade?JOSH SCHAFER: That's why I'm going with purple. It's simple.DAVID BRIGGS: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: I don't know if it's ever happened.SEANA SMITH: I'm going orange.JOSH SCHAFER: But I'm going purple.DAVID BRIGGS: OK, all right, that's a good job.JOSH SCHAFER: All right, coming up, Eagles defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh who competes for his second Super Bowl ring on Sunday also boasts an impressive investing portfolio. He'll tell us more about it next.[MUSIC PLAYING]No shortage of storylines ahead of Super Bowl LVII. We've got the first ever meeting of Black quarterbacks, the first ever meeting between two brothers in Jason and Travis Kelce, and the third Super Bowl with three different teams from one of the greatest defensive linemen in NFL history. I'm talking about Eagles five time all-pro defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, who joins us now.Great of you to find the time during this busy week, my friend. So three teams, three Super Bowls. What makes this experience different for you?NDAMUKONG SUH: The experience each and every single year is different. No matter what team you're with, whether you've been with the team for 10 years or two years, every year is different. Every team is different and always going to continue to be that way, unfortunately. But that's part of the business. But it's exciting to have an opportunity to get back to the Super Bowl and have another opportunity to win.SEANA SMITH: Ndamukong, it's great to see. You're playing for my hometown team. So I am clearly rooting for you on Sunday. You're playing this time for Nick Sirianni. Who's not that much older than you. From your time with the Eagles this year, what have you learned from him just in terms of the leadership and his success that he's clearly having so early in his career?NDAMUKONG SUH: He's a great coach. Having played against him last year in the playoffs when I was down in Tampa and we took care of business that first round, but he's a great coach. He understands all the different nuances, has an opportunity to be a leader on the offensive side of the ball, but also understand the defense and how we want to particularly rush up front and get off the quarterbacks. And I think from the standpoint of his leadership, he just understands, it's all about keeping detail-oriented process, focusing on the things that count the most when it comes to situational ball and going from there.DAVID BRIGGS: I mentioned that quarterback match-up, which is so intriguing. Tell me about the key to defending, to stopping, to containing Patrick Mahomes. And if I could ask a double, you shut down your quarterback, Jalen Hurts, this time last year a bit earlier. How much has he grown in that one year?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, we'll start first with Patrick Mahomes. He's a great talent, very, very elusive, to say the least. I've been going against him in years past, but most notably in the 2021 Super Bowl that I won with Tampa. He's just always extending the play. And that's something that as a defensive line that we have to focus on.There's no end in rushing. Until that ball either incomplete or you got a sack and he's fully, fully down, you've got to keep rushing. Because he loves to extend plays and make things happen and getting balls to the receivers, especially 87.And so when it comes to transitioning to Jalen, I think Jalen has grown tremendously. He's found a way to not only hurt people with his feet, but as well as his arm. And I think the GM Howard did an amazing job defining great talent around him and adding some pieces, for example, AJ Brown.DAVID BRIGGS: Boy, has he come a long way in just one year. Speaking of, you've come a long way over your career. You were once voted the dirtiest player in the league. You've been fined more than $600,000. But, recently, you played peacekeeper against the Niners. How do you think you have evolved over these 13 years? Or were you just misunderstood?NDAMUKONG SUH: I've always said it, if people ever take the time to really get to understand me and get to know me and really truthfully be unbiased when it comes to my personality and my character, they wouldn't have made those votes and they wouldn't have had that particular characteristics around me as a person. I've always been some sort of a peacekeeper or, if you want to call it that. But I know Trent well. So when he saw me getting in front of him and it wasn't about anything other than the game is pretty much over, let's move on, let's get to the next play and go from there.SEANA SMITH: You've clearly had a lot of success on the field. You've also had a lot of success off the field as well. I know you have invested in over 30 companies. One of your mentors is actually Warren Buffett. Talk to us just about that relationship, the biggest lessons that you've learned from him, and how that's really helped shape your investment career.NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think the biggest thing that I've learned from Mr. Buffett is just being able to have good people around you. And as you see, he has multiple companies. He trusts those folks and puts them in places and empowers them.And that's something that I like to do, not only in my foundation with my family and my wife, but also being to be able to empower people, whether it's in the real estate realm, having a development company, being able to build multifamily housing, being able to take care of other people and finding ways to find affordable housing for folks that should be afforded to them at all times. And it's tough in this day and age, especially going through the pandemic. You saw that it's probably its worst. And so hopefully we can continue as a collective to get better in that space. But when it comes to investing, I just have fun with it.I love learning. I love being able to sit down with folks. I actually sat down with one of our owners yesterday to have a great conversation of how he built his company with KKR. I've done some work with them. And so it's a fun opportunity for me to just be able to build relationships and learn from folks and then being able to be involved and be hands-on.SEANA SMITH: You mentioned your involvement in real estate there a moment ago, some of your initiatives, how you're looking to tackle housing affordability. From your perspective from your involvement in the space over the last several years, what more do you think needs to be done? And how do we better address this issue?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think it's-- I think one of the key things that we could do, especially when it comes to affordable housing, is kind of take it out of the city and state's hands. If we privatize it in a manner and incentivize private real estate people, it'd be great. Because if you really look at it and break down the numbers from a perspective how I look at it, it's one of the most expensive housing just because of the rules and regulations that go into it, which I understand and respect. But if we potentially looked at it being privatized, I think would be a lot faster and to be able to be something that is afforded to people a lot quicker.SEANA SMITH: You're involved in over 30 companies here. I think a lot of people at home are asking, how do you have the time for this? How involved are you with each investment?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think I'm very, very involved in every single day, finding time to be able to do it. But it's really being able to compartmentalize things. Obviously, playing football pulls me away from it a fair amount. But I've been at it for 13 years. I understand how I need to study, how I need to focus, even going into a very important week like this week with the Super Bowl, I can still look at things. I probably won't as detailed and push it off just a week or two.But, for me, I still look at opportunities and find time to do it. And I think one of the greatest things that helps you keep you sharp. Because if you get overloaded in one particular thing, then you don't have the capacity to go and look at other things and find ways to keep your mind sharp when it comes to, one, playing football and knowing what you need to accomplish.DAVID BRIGGS: That is a super sharp man and a likely future Hall of Famer Ndamukong Suh. Well, if you don't have a ticket to the Super Bowl, you're not too late. And the trends are, in fact, going in your favor. So maybe be patient. You will, though, have to shell out a ton of cash to go to this game.We're taking a look at the prices all through this week. The cheapest tickets selling for $4,300. That was Monday, according to StubHub. But that number gradually declining through the week, the opposite trend that we usually see-- dropping $200 Tuesday, a huge drop of $500 on Wednesday. And we're finishing out the week with the cheapest ticket costing $3,100. Still a ton of cheddar, but it's come down considerably from the beginning of the week.All that data is for the cheapest ticket to the game. That's in the nosebleeds. If you want the good seats, if you want to bring a friend that you're trying to impress, you've got to really shell out. And here's the cost.You can sit in section 138M, row 44, main end zone. Tickets are a cool $87,000 each. So you and a friend will pay over $174,000 to see the game. You better-- well, we won't go on.Some other trends we're watching, Eagles fans are outselling Chiefs fans by more than double, according to StubHub. That fits what we're hearing from Kevin Cirilli on the ground in Arizona. The ticket vendor seeing a last-minute sales spike in Mexico, the top, number two top selling country outside of the US, behind Canada. And most US buyers are coming from these five states-- no surprise, Pennsylvania, California, New Jersey, Arizona, and Florida. Chiefs fans in Missouri and Kansas accounting for a combined 8% of sales. What's going on, Chiefs fans? You've got a couple of days to try to change that dynamic.Coming up, Apple will be in the spotlight at Super Bowl LVII. Find out what a big Sunday could mean for that company. And we asked you if Rihanna will bring out any surprise guests during the Apple-sponsored Super Bowl halftime show. Roughly 60% of you said ""yes."" We will discuss coming up who that might be. Some of you made predictions. We've got A$AP Rocky, Miley Cyrus, JAY-Z, even Beyoncé as a possible guest. More on what else to expect coming up next.[MUSIC PLAYING]SEANA SMITH: A huge part of the Super Bowl is the halftime show, with many people tuning into the game just for that big performance. This year, Apple is the official sponsor and Rihanna is taking the stage with her first live performance in years. I know I'm very excited for the game. Allie Canal is very excited for the game. She's on the set. Now you don't have to look any further than that jersey that she's wearing for who she's rooting for this weekend.ALLIE CANAL: Go Birds. Go Birds.DAVID BRIGGS: She's chair dancing, man.SEANA SMITH: She's chair dancing.ALLIE CANAL: I'm, like, in such a great mood. I'm so excited.SEANA SMITH: There we go. We're ready.ALLIE CANAL: Right.JOSH SCHAFER: You might have to hide on Monday. I don't know.SEANA SMITH: Lots of hype here. All right, Al, let's talk about the halftime show, right? Because lots of money going into it, lots of hype ahead of this show. What can we expect? And how expensive is it for these musicians?ALLIE CANAL: Well, the NFL, you know, famously doesn't pay the halftime performers. But it does pay for all the upfront costs. So think about the stages, the background dancers, the lighting. That's all the NFL. And that could amount to a pretty hefty price tag, around $17 million.That was a reported cost for last year's show. You know RiRi. She's going to want the production value. It could be even more for that. And for Rihanna, she was asked to do the halftime show back in 2019. She said no in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick.Now she's back. She said she's ready for this moment. She's apparently changed her setlist 39 times. So I am ready for this. And it's going to be very big for her in terms of her streams on those music platforms like Spotify, like Apple Music.If you take a look at the past, last year's performance, which featured Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem, and 50 Cent, each and every one of those performers saw a boost to their personal catalogs. Dr. Dre saw 183% increase in album sales, a 105% bump in on-demand streams. Mary J. Blige, her album sales jumped almost 1,000%, with Snoop Dogg's rising 361%.And then if you take a look at the five years prior, we have The Weeknd, J.Lo, Shakira, Maroon 5, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, all an uptick in digital downloads, album sales, Spotify streams. So the exposure here is unbelievable. And that's really why it's worth it for a lot of these artists. And we've seen an uptick in the amount of viewers that are actually tuning in and watching this halftime show. Last year, for example, viewership was up 7% compared to 2021 with more than 130 million people tuning in. So we'll have to see if Rihanna can get those numbers up even higher, which I think she can.DAVID BRIGGS: Do you really?ALLIE CANAL: I do. People are excited about this.DAVID BRIGGS: I know, I know. I'm excited. Don't get me wrong. A lot of people want to know, opening song and special guest. We've seen a lot of that in recent years. What do you got?ALLIE CANAL: Opening song, I've got ""Run This Town."" That just feels to me like an opening song. Special guest, I think it has to be JAY-Z. JAY-Z's Roc Nation is a producer of the halftime show. Rihanna is also signed to the Roc Nation label. So I feel like he's going to help out his girl. He's featured on a lot of her songs. So that's my prediction. That's where I'm going with it.DAVID BRIGGS: We're going to go around the horn real quick. I'm going to go totally outside the box. I think she is unconventional. I don't think she's going to do anybody predictable. It's going to be a country star. It's going to be like Zach Bryan--SEANA SMITH: That would be a curveball.DAVID BRIGGS: --or Zac Brown Band.JOSH SHAFER: Chris Stapleton stays after the National Anthem?DAVID BRIGGS: Oh, that'd be amazing, my favorite singer of all time. But I think someone-- Sugarland, someone like that. Unconventional, brings in a different portion of the audience.SEANA SMITH: I've got to agree with Allie. I was going to go JAY-Z before we even heard her pick. I think that makes the most sense. We know he has shown a little bit of resistance against the Super Bowl halftime show in the past. I would not be surprised if we see him on that stage on Sunday.JOSH SCHAFER: They always make fun of on the sports shows when everyone picks the same team, right, and we all have the same little icon on the bottom. Because I'm going to pick JAY-Z too.SEANA SMITH: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: So that's when they normally say that's not going to happen. But I don't know. It's my favorite song. ""Run This Town"" is my favorite song. JAY-Z is, obviously, very involved, as Allie said. So that was my pick before everyone else picked. So we've got to stay with it.SEANA SMITH: All right, I like ""Umbrella.""DAVID BRIGGS: Wow.ALLIE CANAL: She's predicting ""Umbrella.""SEANA SMITH: ""Ella-ella-ella.""ALLIE CANAL: ""Umbrella"" as a finale-- I could see a bunch of umbrellas out there.SEANA SMITH: Yes, exactly. It could be a good one. We'll see.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, I like that.SEANA SMITH: Clearly, we are very excited for the halftime show. David, you've got to jump on board here, you know?DAVID BRIGGS: I am, man.SEANA SMITH: We're going to get you to become a Rihanna fan.ALLIE CANAL: He's such a boomer. Dave is a boomer.SEANA SMITH: Sooner rather than later.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm gonna be honest, that's when I get my Buffalo chicken dip, man, whatever.SEANA SMITH: All right.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm here for the game.ALLIE CANAL: OK, boomer.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, thanks so much. Well, Apple, like we've been talking about, replacing Pepsi as the official sponsor for this year's Super Bowl halftime show. $250 million deal spans five years. This is according to the ""Sports Business Journal."" Let's discuss what this means for the tech giant.For that, we want to bring back Dan Ives, Wedbush managing director, its senior equity analyst. Dan, it's great to see you here. So, clearly, a huge move for Apple, now being the sponsor of the halftime show. How big of a win do you think it is for the company?Dan, I think you're muted. And we love the Eagles jersey, by the way. Got it?DAN IVES: OK, so part of what Cook and Cupertino are focused on is really on the NFL and live sports. And this is an important part of, ultimately, what we see Apple doing more and more of over the coming years. I think it's a huge win. And especially in this macro period, Apple doing this further flexes the muscles.SEANA SMITH: Dan, when you talked about Apple here going forward, I think lots of questions just about the amount of money that they have spent or are going to spend on the halftime shows over the next several years. When you see that, does that make sense for them, given the fact that there's no guaranteed return on this type of investment?DAN IVES: But Apple, they're tacticians in terms of how they spend. And this is something they don't just do quickly. And if you look at the history, I mean, they have basically made big bets that have been home successes. And I also I think at this juncture, it's very important that they're investing at a time where some others maybe be are pulling back. And I think that's an important time, especially going into more iPhone launches as well as some other technologies I'd expect them to introduce over the coming months.DAVID BRIGGS: You thought they were going to take a big swing at the Sunday NFL Ticket package. What happened there? Did they end up making a bid? Did it just get out of the range they wanted to spend? And do you think they'll take another pass at an NBA, NFL type of property?DAN IVES: Yeah, and, look, I think there was significant involvement. I think some reports have talked about it. I just think it got to a point where they're only going to spend a certain amount. Ultimately, they were not going to go to that level.But live sports is the key to streaming. I mean, that is one of the keys for Apple when it comes to the streaming piece. I don't think they're stopping here. I think they're going to go after major sports over the coming years. When you look at that content strategy, I mean, it just further highlights whether it's streaming in terms of on TV or what we see with Apple Music, services, under the radar, has actually morphed into a pretty massive business.DAVID BRIGGS: How much will live sports mean for this tech battle? We just discussed Apple. You've got Google who made the big play for Sunday NFL Ticket, $2 and 1/2 billion a year, rumored to be per year, and then Amazon, of course, already in with Thursday Night Football. Or is it not that important in terms of the overall growth investor story?DAN IVES: I think it's a golden jewel, I mean, in terms of what big tech is focused on with streaming. Live sports is what is ultimately-- and that's why the value continues to go up. Because that's just traditional media. I think big tech is going to take significant bets on live sports over the coming year, especially as you look into '23, '24, '25, '26, a lot sort of come up for renewal. And I think streaming is going to be a big part of that over the coming years.SEANA SMITH: Dan, we don't have to ask you who you're rooting for, very clear. Got to ask you about the score. What do you think it's going to be on Sunday?DAN IVES: I see Eagles by 10.SEANA SMITH: OK.DAN IVES: I think, ultimately, yeah, I think between Hurts and that defense, I see a lot of happy fans in the 215 area code.SEANA SMITH: I hope you are right. 215 area code is my hometown. Dan Ives, great to see you. Thanks so much.DAN IVES: Thank you.SEANA SMITH: All right, Josh has another bet that he's watching over there. What do you got now, Josh?JOSH SCHAFER: All right, guys, we've got the coin toss now. You can bet on a 50/50 coin toss. I know, how exciting, right? But people will do it.And we asked our viewers what they picked. And they like heads. We had 55% or just about 55% of people say that they would vote heads or bet heads. But then when you look actually at where the money is right now at a place like Caesars Sportsbook, the money's on tails.58% of people betting on tails. You can see the odds right there, -102 and -102. Of course, even odds because, again, it's a 50/50 bet. Now, if you want to go fun stats, four out of the last five Super Bowls were heads.DAVID BRIGGS: That is nice research.SEANA SMITH: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: So I don't know if that makes you think your tails is due or--SEANA SMITH: What would you bet, Josh?JOSH SCHAFER: I would go heads.SEANA SMITH: You would go heads?JOSH SCHAFER: Yes, in a former life, I did the coin toss all the time. I always went heads. You've got to play the same one every time. I think you have to do a strategy on a 50/50.SEANA SMITH: Stick with it.DAVID BRIGGS: Real quickly, I want your pick with the spread. It's Philly by 1 and 1/2. Who do you got?JOSH SCHAFER: Dave, I have a lot of bets set up. Why don't we talk about that in about 10 minutes?DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, all right. Nice tease.JOSH SCHAFER: Coming up next, the Super Bowl ad landscape is getting a makeover. Find out why sports betting platforms like FanDuel could be a winning bet on Sunday.[MUSIC PLAYING]- It's called the kick of destiny.- What the heck is kick of destiny?- Good luck. See you in Phoenix. Don't miss.- Oh, boy.DAVID BRIGGS: Oh, it's going to be live, 45 yard field goal for Gronk FanDuel's Kick of Destiny campaign starring Rob Gronkowski, getting plenty of buzz ahead of the big game. Who else is getting bang for their 7 million bucks? John Connors is the co-founder and CEO of marketing and communications agency Boathouse. He joins us now. John, good to see you, man.So last year was labeled the Crypto Bowl. How significant a presence is gambling making? Did they replace crypto?JOHN CONNORS: Yeah, I think to your point, this year is going to be the-- you know, the booze, chips, and gambling bowl all combined. And I love the fact that you led with Gronk.SEANA SMITH: Well, speaking of it being the booze, chips, and gambling bowl, let's talk about the gambling aspect of it with the booze. Because Molson Coors is back in the Super Bowl after more than 30 years. They're teaming up with DraftKings. And what's interesting about this initiative is that they're allowing users to bet on who they think, for example, what beer is going to appear first, what dog is going to be used in the commercial. From your perspective, just the engagement aspect of this, how smart is that? And what do you think we'll hear from other alcohol brands this Sunday?JOHN CONNORS: Yeah, I mean, I think, to your point, you can't separate gambling from the Super Bowl, right? And so the ability to make that brand connection and to get that engagement, these days, everyone's trying to figure out how they can drive up that engagement value, how they can drive up that social value, how they can drive up the conversation. And so I think FanDuel and DraftKings have done masterful jobs, sort of between the Gronk bet and the betting on Coors Miller and all the other pieces of driving up as much conversation as possible.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, the live element of the FanDuel ad, have we ever seen anything like that? And how big do you think that will pay off?JOHN CONNORS: I think we've seen things like that, but not in the Super Bowl, right? So I think at this level, I mean, I think you've seen a lot of categories try and launch a lot of new ideas all the way back to Apple in 1984. It's always a massive platform for new launches. And I think as those two exchange blows to sort of capture attention, capture volume, I think it's a masterful play.SEANA SMITH: Well, John, for the big ads, they're pricing out just around $7 million for 30 seconds. We're seeing many companies team up. Like we've been talking about one GM and Netflix in this ad starring Will Ferrell.WILL FERRELL: General Motors is going electric. And Netflix is joining by including more EVs in their movies and shows. The least they can do. So, if you're going to get swarmed by an army of the dead, why not get swarmed in an EV? Ew. I said no biting.- Oh.WILL FERRELL: Or if you're being voluntarily kidnapped, why not be kidnapped in an EV? What's that scent? Is it pine?SEANA SMITH: So GM teaming up with Netflix, trying to push their EVs to make them more mainstream. What do you think of this strategy, a big streamer teaming up with an automaker?JOHN CONNORS: I think you're seeing-- well, last year's automakers were an interesting strategy. It was majority of electric vehicles when none of them had the electric vehicles yet. So they were all teasing sort of what was coming down the road. I think you're seeing that collaboration piece across the Super Bowl this year. I think, you know, the marketers like to follow the artists. And the artists have been doing collabs for a long time.And I think we're just seeing a significant number. As you know as well, there's a little more safety in a collaboration. Sort of two teams, two big brands like Netflix and GM going at it together just drives it a little bit more safety for that chief marketing officer.SEANA SMITH: All right, John Connors, thanks so much for joining us. I know a lot of us are very excited for all the ads that we will be seeing in just two days from now.JOHN CONNORS: Go Eagles.SEANA SMITH: Well, coming up, the Super Bowl Indicator. We'll tell you how stocks may perform next week based on the big game's outcome. Stay with us.[MUSIC PLAYING]JOSH SCHAFER: Welcome back to our Super Bowl special here on Yahoo Finance. Normally, we talk plenty about market indicators on this show, like a 100-day moving average or how stocks perform in election years. But some say even sports can tell us where Mr. Market is headed over the next year. Ryan Detrick over at Carson Research recently released the latest data for what's known as the Super Bowl Indicator, which tells us how markets perform depending on the outcome of the big game.So let's keep it simple to start. Markets have historically performed better after a team from the NFC conference wins than if the AFC wins. You can see here that's 10% for the NFC, an average return 6.9% for the AFC. So, really, people should be rooting for this indicator for the Eagles, who are in the NFC. That would give us a better return per the data.Now that was a historical chart, of course, going all the way back and counting all outcomes. But both these teams have also won Super Bowls in the past. So the Eagles have won one Super Bowl just a couple of years ago. And the S&amp;P 500 fell 6.2% that year.The Chiefs have won two Super Bowls. When you average those together, that's up 8.1%. So not a lot to take there, only three games. I don't think that's my favorite one. Let's get to my favorite one.Market bulls should really be rooting for a blowout on Sunday. So if you take a look here, the average return of the S&amp;P 500 is 8.5%. Now, when there's a single-digit win in the Super Bowl, it goes up 4.9% on average. When there's a double-digit win in the Super Bowl, it goes up 10.9% on average. But when there's a blowout and someone wins by 21 points or more, there's a blowout in the markets too. And the S&amp;P 500 rises on average 13.6% that year.So I don't know about you guys, I might root for an Eagles blowout on Sunday.SEANA SMITH: Heck yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Maybe my 401(k) can recover from last year a little bit.DAVID BRIGGS: Philly fan here is going to root for that. That will not happen. They could have a comfortable win, but not a blowout win.JOSH SCHAFER: Well, keep that thought.DAVID BRIGGS: Where is the public money at?JOSH SCHAFER: The public money? Let's take a look at the public money, Dave. So we know the spread is 1 and 1/2, right, coming into this game. So the Eagles are favored by 1 and 1/2. And the public money right now is on the Eagles.So 69% of the handle on DraftKings Sportsbook is currently on the Eagles to cover that 1 and 1/2 point spread. So that means they'd have to win by 2. And then where I really want to bet on Sunday, I think, because I love the totals, is 51. So 51 is the total. And that's where people are betting right now.Here's my favorite bet, though. Travis Kelce, first touchdown. I bet it earlier in the playoffs. It hit. I love the first touchdown bets. It's really exciting to watch the first couple drives and see it. Plus 700, I'm all over it, Dave.Seana, what are you watching on Sunday? Give us a bet. You've got to give us a pick.SEANA SMITH: All right, well, I went in with a parlay. And I stole this from Ross Tucker, full disclosure. But I've got to give credit where credit's due. And I liked it. I liked it a lot.So let's talk about it. I think Jalen Hurts is going to score a touchdown. I think Haason Reddick is also going to get a sack. And I also think that the Eagles are going to win. And I'm confident in it.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, Tucker's a pretty good gambler. He's no dummy. I've got a dumb bet. Because these are dumb bets when you have multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple things that have to happen. Patrick Mahomes over 1 and 1/2 touchdowns, Travis Kelce over 50 yards, AJ Brown over 50 yards, DeVonta Smith-- receiver for the Eagles-- under 63 and 1/2 yards, and Jalen Hurts over 40 yards rushing. Full disclosure, I also stole mine from a 15-year-old who lives in my house. But he's pretty good at this.JOSH SCHAFER: It seems like we bet a lot on the ankle injuries there and the lower extremities. How healthy is Jalen Hurts? How healthy is Patrick Mahomes? To talk football a little bit, I'm nervous about some of those prop bets. I've heard some--DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, you don't like it? You don't like it?JOSH SCHAFER: I don't know.DAVID BRIGGS: Well, look, the thing-- now, I say a dumb bet because those have such tremendous odds that they lure in a lot of people because they pay off well. But no one ever wins them.JOSH SCHAFER: They have the highest hold rate for sportsbooks. Sportsbooks want you to bet those same game parlays because they make the most money off of them. But coming up, we're talking about inflation. It's crashing your Super Bowl party. Find out how much you'll need to shell out for food and drinks when we come back.[MUSIC PLAYING]SEANA SMITH: What good is watching football if you don't have a bevy of snacks and also drinks to enjoy during the big game? But this year, you've got to keep a very close eye on that price tag. Because when it comes to checkout, some fan favorites are much pricier than they've been in years past. Allie Canal joining us now with a closer look at what we will be paying this weekend. Allie, what do you got?ALLIE CANAL: Wow, the good news is, Seana, if you want some chicken wings-- which we have on our set now-- that's actually cheaper, 22% cheaper compared to this time last year, $2.65 versus $3.38 per pound the week of Super Bowl 2022. And that's due to a larger supply of wings, decreased freight costs, all of that driving prices lower. And if you want to get a little bit fancier than wings, we have sirloin steak prices. That's also down by about $1 per pound. I feel like you really are a steak guy, Philly cheesesteak maybe?DAVID BRIGGS: Not during the Super Bowl.SEANA SMITH: Philly cheesesteak--ALLIE CANAL: Philly cheesesteak, though-- I think that could be an option.JOSH SCHAFER: You can't have a steak during the Super Bowl.ALLIE CANAL: I know, so you probably want to stick with the wings. Plus, 22% versus, you know, versus the $1 less, I think you go with the wings here. But chips and guac, avocados, they're also down, which is nice. But something that's up is your beer, 11% higher.SEANA SMITH: Wow.DAVID BRIGGS: And they've seen demand slip because of that towards the end of the year, yeah.ALLIE CANAL: And I think it's interesting too that soft drinks as well, they're up 25% So it's actually cheaper to get a little buzz going than just stay sober during the game. But we were talking about--SEANA SMITH: You need another reason to go out and get a drink during the big game.JOSH SHAFER: In the spirit of that--ALLIE CANAL: In the spirit of that, but talking about spirits, though, that's actually only up 2% while wine is up 3%. So maybe a little sangria action if you don't want the beer. That's a cheaper option.DAVID BRIGGS: Not bad.ALLIE CANAL: But, overall, I think for the Super Bowl people, people want to drink their beer.DAVID BRIGGS: Wings versus boneless wings, Allie. You are the expert. We have them both here. Seana and I are team boneless.SEANA SMITH: We are.ALLIE CANAL: I'm not Team Boneless. I am--SEANA SMITH: We're on a little island by ourselves.ALLIE CANAL: I'm bone-in, but I'm flats over drumsticks all day.SEANA SMITH: Oh, yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah.SEANA SMITH: What about you?JOSH SCHAFER: No, I'm absolutely bone-in. I am of the take that if you have boneless wings, they're actually just--ALLIE CANAL: That just looks sad.JOSH SCHAFER: --those are chicken nuggets. Those are chicken nuggets. Those are chicken nuggets.DAVID BRIGGS: Josh, Seana, Allie--SEANA SMITH: I will eat them all to myself.DAVID BRIGGS: --thank you, guys. That'll do it for our big game coverage. Enjoy the weekend. Enjoy the Super Bowl. And we'll see you on Monday.ALLIE CANAL: Go Birds.]"

If you want to see more most profitable cheap stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Cheap Stocks to Buy.Cheap stocks are stocks that trade below what many people think they're really worth. Given different people have different opinions on what's cheap, cheap stocks are subjective. Some people might think a stock is cheap but others may not.Nevertheless, some of the best cheap stocks in the long term are blue chip stocks with substantial competitive advantages trading for fair or below average valuations.Cheap stocks can trade for lower valuations for various reasons.Some companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) might spend more money than the market would like on a project for instance and that's weighed on the stock as result. In recent years, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has spent over ten billion dollars annually on building the metaverse without any meaningful profits to show for it yet. Given the tens of billions more the company plans to invest, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock declined substantially in 2022 before its 2023 rally.Some companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) might experience more competition in the future as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to incorporate the popular ChatGPT AI into Bing. Although ChatGPT makes a lot of mistakes, many find the AI useful given the strong adoption since its launch. If Bing gains substantial market share given new AI tools it will soon launch, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s earnings could decrease in the near term and the company will need to launch new services that will need to do well to preserve its growth.Other companies might be affected by macroeconomic headwinds. In 2022, inflation rose substantially and the Federal Reserve had to raise interest rates considerably as a result. With the substantially higher interest rates, U.S. Treasury yields have increased considerably, and the outflow of capital from the equity market into the Treasury market has weighed on some valuations.Story continuesAlthough inflation has recently eased from its highs late last year, many economists think the U.S. central bank might have to raise rates several more times this year to make sure that inflation has really peaked. If the Federal Reserve raises rates too much, there could be an economic slowdown or even a recession that might weigh on earnings.If economic conditions normalize in the long term, however, the valuations of the leading stocks could also potentially normalize assuming that they maintain their market shares and profitability.Similarly, if companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s metaverse project end up being very profitable, there's potential for upside.Every company is different and some companies might not do as well as expected even if they have a lot of competitive advantages. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Capital, Finance, HoldingPhoto by Karen Uppal on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 11 Most Profitable Cheap Stocks to Buy, we selected blue chip stocks that either trade below their normal valuations or have the potential to increase their earnings substantially in the next ten years.We ranked each stock based on their TTM net income according to YCharts.We used YCharts' TTM net income, which might not incorporate adjusted income. Given some companies have not reported their fourth quarter earnings and some companies have different fiscal years, the net income might not cover the same time periods.11 Most Profitable Cheap Stocks to Buy11. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Net Income (TTM) as of December 31, 2022: $3.32 billionThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is an entertainment conglomerate that trades for a forward P/E of 20.43, which isn't necessarily cheap by conventional standards. Nevertheless, analysts expect the company's earnings to increase in the future as they have consensus estimates of $3.78 per share for 2022, $4.13 per share for 2023, $5.48 per share for 2024, and $6.73 per share for 2025. If The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) meets or exceeds analyst profit estimates, the stock could be cheap in the long term, especially if the company's Disney+ streaming service keeps growing and the company successfully monetizes its substantial number of users. For the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2022, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) had net income of $3.32 billion.Alongside Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

Total AUM at the end of Q4 2022 was $5.594 trillion, down 14% given the declines in various markets however.While the company experienced a 8% decrease in full year revenue given the lower markets and lower AUM, the company nevertheless returned $4.9 billion to shareholders in the year, including $1.9 billion in share repurchases. While there is still some uncertainty in the near term, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK)'s long term EPS growth potential still looks attractive given the expected continued growth in AUM and the company's capital returns. Shares of BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) trade for a forward P/E of 18.16 as of 2/10.9. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Net Income (TTM) as of November 30, 2022: $5.634 billionAlthough its stock has rallied almost 50% from the lows in October of 2022, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares are still down 16.4% over the last year as the high inflation has weakened demand for the company's premium apparel. Nevertheless, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) exceeded Wall Street's expectations for its quarter ended November 30, with sales up 17% year over year and EPS of $0.85 versus the expected EPS of $0.64. According to YCharts, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) also had trailing twelve month net income of $5.634 billion as of November 30, 2022.8. Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)Net Income (TTM) as of October 31, 2022: $6.686 billionLowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is one of the largest home retailers in the United States that's trading for a forward P/E of 15.

(NYSE:LOW) has been profitable with net income in the last four quarters of almost $6.7 billion according to YCharts. Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) also has a substantial stock buyback program which could help its EPS growth in the future if the company maintains its market share and profitability.7. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Net Income (TTM) as of December 31, 2022: $13.18 billionWells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) had net income of $13.18 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. Return on assets for the year was 0.7% and return on equity was 7.5%. Net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis for the year was 2.63%. Although Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)'s earnings could decrease if there is an economic slowdown or recession in the United States, the bank nevertheless has substantial earnings power in the long term. As of February 10, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) has a forward P/E ratio of 9.07 and a dividend yield of 2.53%.6. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Net Income (TTM) as of December 31, 2022: $14.84 billionCitigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is one of the big four American banks with a forward P/E ratio of 7.44 and a dividend yield of 4.07%. Citigroup Inc.

(NYSE:PRU) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Thus, you can purchase Prudential Financial's shares before the 17th of February in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 16th of March.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.25 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$5.00 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Prudential Financial stock has a trailing yield of around 4.9% on the current share price of $103.03. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Prudential Financial Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Prudential Financial reported a loss after tax last year, which means it's paying a dividend despite being unprofitable. While this might be a one-off event, this is unlikely to be sustainable in the long term.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Prudential Financial was unprofitable last year and, unfortunately, the general trend suggests its earnings have been in decline over the last five years, making us wonder if the dividend is sustainable at all.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Prudential Financial has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Prudential Financial's financial health, by checking our visualisation of its financial health, here.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Prudential Financial? First, it's not great to see the company paying a dividend despite being loss-making over the last year. Worse, the general trend in its earnings looks negative in recent years. These characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance, and investors may not be happy with the results of owning this stock for its dividend.Although, if you're still interested in Prudential Financial and want to know more, you'll find it very useful to know what risks this stock faces. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Prudential Financial and you should be aware of them before buying any shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Ruefully watching the most popular entities jumping dramatically higher during the first two years of the coronavirus pandemic, 2022 imposed a reality check. But it also meant that those sitting on the sidelines have a time capsule opportunity to correct past indecisions.I’m not here to suggest that you should avoid this approach. However, with the market taking a relative breather from prior highs, it’s also time to consider misunderstood enterprises. These companies may not be getting a fair shake for a variety of reasons. Maybe they’re boring or deemed controversial.Whatever the case is, many companies lurking in the shadows actually represent fantastic opportunities Below are seven surprisingly great stock buys.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRHIRobert Half$84.39HRBH&amp;R Block$39.40CVXChevron$170.00VVVValvoline$34.65SMRNuScale$10.24HIIHuntington Ingalls$225.70SCIService Corporation$71.00Robert Half (RHI)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockThroughout much of the new normal, staffing service provider Robert Half (NYSE:RHI) faced a contested environment. On one hand, the pandemic initially sparked concerns of an economic catastrophe. To be sure, circumstances have not returned to normal. But on the other end, workers just didn’t want to go back to the usual way of doing things. Thus, a lack of desperation pressured Robert Half’s business.Naturally, this circumstance clouded the narrative for RHI. However, recent dynamics suggest that the enterprise represents one of the great stock buys. With mass layoffs dominating business headlines, recalcitrant professionals have recognized a harsh reality: if you don’t work, you don’t eat. Put another way, desperation may be coming back and that would bode very well for RHI stock.To be completely transparent, Wall Street doesn’t see it that way. Presently, analysts peg RHI as a consensus hold. Also, their price target implies downside potential of over 11%. Frankly, it’s misunderstood. Sure, it may have been a sell earlier. Today with the layoffs? RHI ranks among the great stock buys.Story continuesH&amp;R Block (HRB)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comNo one enjoys doing their taxes – even for those with simple returns. It’s just more busy paperwork that nobody needs. Just give us our refund and go away, Uncle Sam! Well, this attitude helps undergird why H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) stands among the misunderstood companies that actually are great stock buys.Primarily, corporate employees that don’t want to return to the pre-pandemic rat race have two choices: suck it up or join the burgeoning gig economy. As Business Research Insights claims, the global gig economy could reach a market valuation of $873 billion by 2028. That would be a massive surge from where the market stands today. However, the IRS taxes employees and gig workers (or independent contractors) differently.Without getting bogged down with the details, gig workers feature tax-filing requirements similar to “actual” businesses. For first timers, H&amp;R Block offers an invaluable. It’s just wild that only one analyst actively covers HRB. Whatever – it’s one of the great stock buys as said analyst attests.Chevron (CVX)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7While it’s impossible to classify Chevron (NYSE:CVX) as overlooked, it ranks among the misunderstood great stock buys. With both ideological and kinetic catalysts driving international policymakers to renewable energy infrastructures, fossil fuels seemingly stand poised to disappear. Nothing could be further from the truth. Even President Joe Biden admitted as such during his State of the Union address.\Naturally, big oil firms don’t get much public support, particularly during periods of rising prices. Further, Chevron’s controversy regarding stock buybacks – to the tune of $75 billion worth – don’t help matters. Setting this issue aside, though, the fundamental reality remains the same: we need big oil.Still, Wall Street does not necessarily share the view that CVX represents one of the great stock buys. Currently, analysts peg CVX as a hold (although their average price target implies 11% upside). Scientifically, when more folks realize that fossil fuels command tremendous energy density, the tune may change decisively northward.Valvoline (VVV)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comTo be clear with my language, I wouldn’t necessarily peg Valvoline (NYSE:VVV) as a misunderstood enterprise. Specializing in its namesake-branded automotive oil, additives, and lubricants, every driver knows what Valvoline is. However, the misunderstanding may come in the framework of an investment opportunity. Most folks might view VVV as a boring trade. In my eyes, it’s one of the great stock buys.As stated earlier, the labor force presently experiences significant changes. While the labor market remains surprisingly robust, certain sectors – such as tech – suffered (and still suffer) steep losses. Naturally, the pink slip distribution sparks anxieties among remaining workers. They must stay visible or risk the chopping block themselves.And that would mean higher traffic volumes due to the return of the morning commute. Cynically, this dynamic augurs well for Valvoline, making it one of the great stock buys. In fairness, some analysts recognize the opportunity, with VVV enjoying a consensus moderate buy view. Also, their average price target implies upside potential of over 11%.NuScale Power (SMR)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comAnytime anyone brings up nuclear power, misunderstandings invariably arise. Such is the product and industry evangelism challenge undergirding NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR). Specializing in small modular reactors, NuScale delivers a novel approach to the controversial energy source. In an email, Justin Huhn, Publisher and Founder of Uranium Insider wrote in part the following:Small modular reactors (SMRs) present an attractive solution for many challenges for providing clean energy solutions. The term SMR refers to the size, capacity, and modular construction only, not to the reactor type and the nuclear process which is applied. Designs range from scaled down versions of existing designs to ‘Gen IV/Advanced’ designs. SMRs are far smaller than conventional nuclear reactors; however, they can be installed in series to generate as much as 500 [megawatt electrical] or more.In particular, infrastructure engineers can develop SMRs closer to the source of energy demand, bolstering energy security and reliability. Still, nobody currently actively covers SMR. It’s a shame because it’s one of the great stock buys.Huntington Ingalls (HII)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comAs a naval shipbuilder, Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII) naturally courts controversies because it belongs in the defense sector. In addition, within the defense industry, other more kinetically pronounced enterprises overshadow Huntington. In some ways, it’s a shame because many folks don’t understand that HII represents one of the great stock buys.Let me be 100% clear (and this is also where misunderstandings occur): nobody should acquire HII hoping for a hot conflict to break out between the U.S. and an adversary. Specific to worsening U.S.-China relations, Huntington benefits from the show of force narrative. In other words, the company builds naval war machines to cause adversaries to think twice about acting out their belligerence.Put another way, defense firms like Huntington do best managing tensions. If tensions turn into hot wars, it does neither party much good. Still, HII carries a hold consensus among covering analysts: two buys, two holds, two sells. It’s hardly a ringing endorsement for what actually stands as one of the great stock buys.Service Corporation (SCI)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comService Corporation (NYSE:SCI) ranks among the misunderstood great stock buys for an obvious reason: it’s an icky topic that very few people (if any) like to talk about. Even the corporate name sends jitters down our spine because we know it’s a euphemism. While we often talk about America being a service economy, this is the one service – the final one – that we’d rather refuse if possible.Of course, it’s not possible unless you happen to be a gifted Nazarene carpenter. For everyone else, it’s inevitable. Still, as macabre as the topic might be, it’s unavoidable. And therefore, it’s also – dare I say it? – lucrative. In particular, with the rapid increase of the population stemming from the post-World War II baby boom, those folks must go somewhere.Scientifically, within a defined system, the conservation of mass states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. I suppose in this framework, bullishness in SCI represents a clear logical deduction. Still, Wall Street analysts don’t see it that way – they don’t see it at all. That’s too bad.

(NASDAQ:NWL) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 15th of March, with investors receiving $0.23 per share. The dividend yield will be 6.2% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. View our latest analysis for Newell Brands Newell Brands' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Based on the last payment, Newell Brands' earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. No cash flows could definitely make returning cash to shareholders difficult, or at least mean the balance sheet will come under pressure.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 5.6%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 66%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendNewell Brands Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.40 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.92. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.7% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.Dividend Growth Potential Is ShakyThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, things aren't all that rosy. Newell Brands' earnings per share has shrunk at 23% a year over the past five years. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.Story continuesOur Thoughts On Newell Brands' DividendOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We don't think Newell Brands is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Newell Brands (of which 1 is concerning!) you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

(NYSE:UPS) For Its Upcoming Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-interested-united-parcel-122020491.html,1676204420,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase United Parcel Service's shares before the 17th of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 10th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.62 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$6.48 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that United Parcel Service has a trailing yield of 3.5% on the current share price of $185.22. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether United Parcel Service can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. United Parcel Service paid out a comfortable 46% of its profit last year. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether United Parcel Service generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out more than half (55%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see United Parcel Service's earnings per share have risen 19% per annum over the last five years. United Parcel Service is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. Given the quick rate of earnings per share growth and current level of payout, there may be a chance of further dividend increases in the future.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, United Parcel Service has lifted its dividend by approximately 11% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.To Sum It UpIs United Parcel Service an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, United Parcel Service paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. United Parcel Service looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.While it's tempting to invest in United Parcel Service for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for United Parcel Service (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable) you should be aware of.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Further, TipRanks notes that hedge fund sentiment rates as “positive.” Therefore, it offers a solid choice among dividend stocks to buy.Story continuesUnited Parcel Service (UPS)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA stalwart in the shipping and receiving industry, United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) represents a critical cog in the broader supply chain management complex.

However, the situation appears to be turning around, with shares gaining over 7% since the January opener.Presently, UPS carries a forward yield of 3.44%. This rates better than the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. Notably, the company’s payout ratio is 52.73%.

In addition, their average price target is $194.94, implying potential upside of 3.53%. While not particularly exciting, UPS ranks among the dividend stocks to buy this year.Amdocs (DOX)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockA multinational software firm, Amdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) specializes in software and services for communications, media and financial services providers and digital enterprises. Contrary to many of its tech peers, Amdocs performed very well in 2022. For instance, in the trailing 365 days, DOX gained nearly 22%. It’s still up almost 4% since the January opener.At the moment, DOX carries a forward yield of 1.83%.

Also, Amdocs features a low payout ratio of 26.75%, meaning investors can depend on it for reliable passive income. Plus, the company enjoys 10 consecutive years of dividend increases.Financially, DOX might attract investors for its value proposition. The market prices shares at a forward multiple of 16.77. As a discount to forward earnings, Amdocs ranks better than 72%.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg DOX as a consensus moderate buy.

These include home improvement, agriculture, lawn and garden maintenance, livestock, equine and pet care for recreational farmers and ranchers, pet owners, and landowners.Although a boring entry among dividend stocks to buy, Tractor did what it does best: keep the ship afloat. In the trailing year, shares gained nearly 5%. While not particularly impressive, it’s a heckuva lot better than falling into negative territory.Presently, Tractor Supply carries a forward yield of 1.58%.

However, the payout ratio sits at 31.69%, making TSCO one of the more dependable dividend stocks to buy.Finally, Wall Street analysts assess TSCO as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target pings at $245.78, implying upside potential of almost 6%.Snap-on (SNA)dividend stocks: A calculator projecting the word ""DIVIDEND"" rests on a pile of gold and silver coins.Source: ShutterstockNot to be confused with the similar-sounding social media firm, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) is an American designer, manufacturer and marketer of high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry. These sectors included the automotive, heavy duty, equipment, marine, aviation and railroad industries.Though another boring behind-the-shadows example of dividend stocks to buy, SNA proves that boring can be profitable.

Currently, the healthcare giant carries a forward yield of 2.77%. This ranks notably higher than the underlying sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Also, its payout ratio of 41.5% provides prospective investors with confidence.

Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) share price is up 33% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 1.1% in the last year.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Coca-Cola achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 17% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 6% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Coca-Cola has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Coca-Cola, it has a TSR of 55% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Coca-Cola shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 1.8% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 9% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Coca-Cola better, we need to consider many other factors.

The big game is a billion dollar business. Major companies like T-Mobile (TMUS), Budweiser (BUD), General Motors (GM), Netflix (NFLX) and Uber (UBER) and set to spend millions of dollars to air a commercial during the broadcast. Betting will also take center stage, with over 50 million people expected to wager billions on sites like DraftKings (DKNG), MGM (MGM) and more. Food prices will also dominate the night; while chicken wings and avocados are cheaper this year, beer prices are on the rise.Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith, Dave Briggs, Josh Schafer and Alexandra Canal take a look at the finances behind the big game.Key Video Takeaways.05:00 - DraftKings CEO Jason Robins11:45 - Governor Katie Hobbs, (D) Arizona18:00 - Philadelphia Eagles Defensive Tackle Ndamukong Suh30:00 - Halftime show expectations42:00 - the big business of Super Bowl ads49:00 - How stocks perform based on the winning team55:00 - Rising food costsVideo TranscriptDAVID BRIGGS: Hey, everybody, Dave and Seana. We got an hour of big game coverage coming for you. The quarterback match-up-- Jalen Hurts versus Patrick Mahomes.SEANA SMITH: And we are talking to him Ndamukong Suh of the Eagles. A huge game on Sunday. He'll obviously be involved with that. We'll talk about the game, also, his investments. Fun fact, he's buddy-buddy with Warren Buffett.DAVID BRIGGS: And one analyst says Apple could win the Super Bowl. We'll tell you why. Also, how much it costs to go to the game and stay home, even to buy those chicken wings.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, those prices are racking up there. And, also, the number of people expected to bet on the Super Bowl-- 50 million Americans, one of the big prop bets, what's going to be the color of that Gatorade shower? What do you think?DAVID BRIGGS: I'm going red.SEANA SMITH: I'm going orange. I was going to go yellow. Reds a bold bet. I like it. We will see who the winner is.Story continues[MUSIC PLAYING]DAVID BRIGGS: Hey, everybody. Welcome into our Super Bowl LVII coverage. I'm Dave Briggs, alongside Seana Smith. Cannot wait for this game. We've got a lot coming your way over the next hour. I'm really excited for the game itself, but I want you to go first on what you're eyeing in the game, or outside the game.SEANA SMITH: Well, in the game-- I'm going to say an overall thing-- it's going to be the Eagles, my hometown team. I am very, very excited for them going for their second title in the last six years. Specific, Jalen Hurts, it's all about him. He's got to keep the momentum. I'm excited about that. Aside from the game, the halftime show. Apple is now going-- is the official sponsor of the show this year, taking over from Pepsi. Rihanna is back on the live music stage. I'm excited.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm just out of the loop on Rihanna. I'm sorry. I don't want to offend anybody. I just don't get it. But I know she's awesome. I'm excited because, look, I think the Eagles have a far superior roster. I do acknowledge that. But Andy Reid always has something interesting up his sleeve. Something you have never seen before, and Patrick Mahomes has that Harry-Potter-like wand. He has magic. I think they actually should be a 7 or an 8-point underdog. I think the Eagles are a much better team. But the Chiefs can really surprise you, but I'll be honest, what I'm really looking forward to is my only Super Bowl tradition, my wife's buffalo chicken dip. It's awesome. Like, that's all that matters for me on Super Bowl Sunday.SEANA SMITH: You're going to bring over the leftovers on Monday, then.DAVID BRIGGS: There won't be any, dude.SEANA SMITH: Well, maybe you should--DAVID BRIGGS: I'll be, like, scraping--SEANA SMITH: --leave a little bit--DAVID BRIGGS: --the bowl with my fingers when the chips run out.SEANA SMITH: I got to get the recipe after this show. All right, well, this might be the biggest Super Bowl yet for the gambling industry. Lots to look forward to this weekend. The American Gaming Association releasing its predictions for Super Bowl LVII, estimating that about 50 million Americans will bet roughly $16 billion on this year's game. That's more than double last year's total, but our own, Josh Schafer, has been looking further into this number, what it really means for the sportsbook operators. What do you got for us, Josh?JOSH SHAFER: That's right, Seana. So that's $16 billion number is, obviously, a massive number, but not all of that is going to go right to the sportsbook. So for starters, that number includes both bets placed legally and illegally. It's also an estimate. And if we take a look at last year's estimate, 7.61 billion translated to just $950 million of legal handle. That's according to the AGA's assessment of state data.So less than 15% of last year's estimation ended up as legal handle. Now, the total amount at legal books, and then if you have to think about how these sportsbooks make money, right? So you take that handle-- that legal handle, that $950 million and then you subtract what's known as the gross winning margin, or you multiply it by that gross winning margin, which is only 10% on average.Then when you multiply those, you end up only getting $95 million as the total legal handle-- or, sorry, the gross gaming revenue, which is what goes back to the sportsbooks. That's the number that ends up getting taxed, and that can be taxed, guys, at about an average of a 20% rate. So there are $95 million then taxed at 20%, it's just not quite as big as that $16 billion number we like to talk about all the time, but it is still a huge week, Dave. The stocks have been roaring headed into the Super Bowl. The three or four of the gambling stocks here over the last month, so it certainly is an exciting time.DAVID BRIGGS: You just took like an extra large pizza and boiled it down to one slice.JOSH SHAFER: But that slice could be delicious. That slice could be absolutely delicious.DAVID BRIGGS: And it's still a pretty solid slice. It's a New York-sized slice. But the game is not in New York. It's in Arizona. And that's the first time we've ever had a legal sports gambling state host a Super Bowl. What does that mean? What are the implications?JOSH SHAFER: Well, it means that people can bet well they're sitting in the stadium, right? And that's the biggest thing that we're going to be watching, and really what I want to point out here too is the tax rate. So Arizona taxes mobile betting at a 10% rate, and why I'm watching that number is because Arizona is probably going to have a higher handle this Sunday than they normally would. They're going to get a 10% rate on that. They're going to get a lot of state revenue, guys. And I'm curious how that leads moving forward. As we continue to see gambling grow, are more states going to want the Super Bowl to bring in a lot of gamblers, get people excited for the game and get more state revenue? Seems like a decent deal to me.DAVID BRIGGS: Where's the game next year? Vegas, baby. I mean--JOSH SHAFER: Not a bad place for gambling.DAVID BRIGGS: That seems like it'll work out well. Great stuff. 50. 50 million Americans expected to throw down $16 billion in bets on Super Bowl LVII. Let's dig into those numbers with DraftKings CEO, Jason Robins. Jason, good to see you, man. 33 states now legal. How big is this weekend for you guys compared to anything you've seen in the past? What are your expectations?JASON ROBINS: Oh, I mean, given the growth of the industry, this is almost certainly going to be our biggest Super Bowl ever. And hard to know, it's always-- we always have predictions around the office going in because it's such a fun time. But one thing we know is it's going to be a big day. We know it's going to be our biggest customer acquisition day, and we're all excited to see the results. By the way, I heard in the other set, you're betting on red for the Gatorade? Is that-- I hear that right?DAVID BRIGGS: Do I have the wrong color, bro?JASON ROBINS: Listen, I don't know, but somebody told me, and you should verify this because I did not verify myself that there has never been red Gatorade poured on the winning coach in the Super Bowl. So maybe this is the year, but just a little hot take for you to check out. And I could be totally wrong on that. It was something somebody told me, but you should check that out.DAVID BRIGGS: Betting scoop. I appreciate that, buddy. That is solid. I had my eye on like an Eagles Green, so I'm going to have to look at the odds here on DraftKings.SEANA SMITH: Jeez, I think I picked orange. Hopefully, my odds are a little bit better than what Dave is facing right now, but, Jason, you talk about the popularity of sports betting, certainly we have seen massive growth over the last several years. With the Super Bowl in Arizona, like we're talking about, the first state with statewide legalized sports gambling here, in terms of the number of users that you are expected to add, can you put a number on that?JASON ROBINS: We can. I mean, one, we actually have earnings next week. So I've got to be careful about saying anything like that, but, also, it's just tough to predict. I mean, so much comes in towards the end and the last day, and even in the last hours. And so hard to say, but I know that we think it'll be our biggest day ever, and that's been the case for the last three Superbowls, or last-- excuse me, four Super Bowls since legalized sports betting as well.JOSH SHAFER: Jason, I'm curious what you're seeing out of the live betting space. Obviously, I think it being in Arizona probably helps, right? With people being excited while they're at the game, to probably bet during the game while they're sitting in the stands. I know often we talk about that Europe number, right? Maybe getting to 70, 75% of all bets, or all handle being in that live betting space. Do you think we eventually get there? Or is that where things are headed? How have you sort of seen those trends?JASON ROBINS: You know, live betting continues to increase. I think whether we get there or higher or a little lower, I don't know. But I think it's going to continue to grow. I think more and more people are starting to see that you can make bets during the game. And that doesn't just mean things like what's the next play or something like that.Some people decide, hey, maybe at halftime, they want to double down on the bet they made before the game. Or maybe they want to switch sides or something like that. So lots of options throughout the game.We also, you mentioned Arizona. This is the first year since legalized sports betting outside of Nevada that you will have a Super Bowl in a state with legal sports betting. So really excited to see how that plays out. I agree with you. I think it's going to have a tremendous halo effect on the state.Because not only the people at the game, but all the people that are in Arizona that know that the Super Bowl is here and are paying attention. And we're doing everything we can to let all the people coming in from out of town know, hey, while you're here, you can make a bet. And I think you're going to see a lot of fans take us up on that.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, that is interesting. And next year it'll be the second in a row because it's in Vegas.JASON ROBINS: Yeah.DAVID BRIGGS: But in terms of the big picture, certainly all the momentum is on the side of the sports gambling. But those three big states are out there-- California, Texas, and Florida. What went wrong in California? And when do you see any of those three states turning legal?JASON ROBINS: Well, I mean, California, it's pretty simple. We had over $200 million in opposition spent against us. I think, you know, eight times maybe is close to that, the next biggest opposition spend of any campaign. So, you know, we were literally attacked with a barrage of ads, many of them pushing false narratives. But not much you can do in a short cycle. And people hear what they hear. And, unfortunately, I think some incorrect facts got out there.So, you know, I think, first, we're going to try to work with the tribes. Obviously, that's a much easier path than trying to fight them. And nobody wants that. We actually had in our ballot initiative revenue going to the tribes. We had tethering to the tribes. Everything had to flow through the tribes.And, you know, we're going to hopefully get another year, another, I guess, two years from now. Well, one year from now, we're going to be able to potentially take another shot. And I think we have to learn from last time and educate a little better and be smarter about it. So we'll see on that.One Texas is in play this year. I think there's a live bill that has a decent shot of advancing. We'll have to see. Obviously, a lot to play out in the legislative session. So, you know, I think those are the two biggest states.Florida, you mentioned also, you know, tribal state, so has some of the same dynamics. But in that case, it's really one tribe, the Seminoles. So, you know, trying to figure out a way to collaborate with them, I think.And, hopefully, that's where the industry is going. There's just more collaboration. And everybody realizes that a rising tide will lift all ships. And, you know, I think that's something that we're seeing slowly but surely to try and move towards. But still a lot of work to do there, and especially in those big states. They're big prizes. So there's obviously going to be a lot of interest and a lot of stakeholders.SEANA SMITH: All right, Jason Robins, CEO of DraftKings, always great to have you. Thanks so much. Have fun this weekend.JASON ROBINS: OK, thank you so much.SEANA SMITH: All right, well, Arizona, like we've been talking about, is hosting this year's Super Bowl. Hundreds of thousands of fans are already there, getting ready for the big game. Yahoo Finance contributor Kevin Cirilli is doing just that. And Kevin, I know you spoke with a lot of key voices down there. I've got to say, I'm very jealous. I wish I was in your shoes right now. Give us a lay of the land. What's it like down there in Arizona right now?KEVIN CIRILLI: Well, when the plane landed at Sky Harbor, I thought I was in Ireland. Because all I kept seeing was green. There are literally-- I mean, there's-- I've seen like maybe one or two Chiefs fans. But, I mean, it's all Eagles fans everywhere. So, I mean, I feel like I'm at home here in sunny Scottsdale. Camelback Mountain behind me, if you know the area.Look, I was at the Phoenix Open, the Waste Management Open earlier this week, which has really become a business private partnership, a public private partnership, really a hub that Jack Selby, who's the managing director for Peter Thiel's family, and he's got his own venture capitalist investing $110 million here in the state. He started this thing. And it's really gone global.And one of the folks he was able to get out there was governor Katie Hobbs, the newly-elected Democratic governor of Arizona. And she noted the economic impact that the Super Bowl, that the Phoenix Open that that's having on this state. Take a listen to what she told me on the 17th hole.KATIE HOBBS: It is huge. It is huge. We have 160,000 workers in our tourism and hospitality industry that are ready to welcome the visitors that are already here, making sure they have a great experience. That gets return visits. And that helps our economy. The last time we had the Super Bowl in 2015, the economic impact was over $700 million.- $700 million?KATIE HOBBS: Yeah, yeah With over 100,000 visitors. So we're expecting to top that. And the lasting benefits for our economy, because we've become sort of-- we have a great track record with these kind of big events. And it's just going to attract more of them in the future.KEVIN CIRILLI: So when you look at the numbers, last year alone, $24.2 billion worth in the sports and tourism industry contributed to Arizona's GDP. They're expecting that the Super Bowl alone will increase that number to more than $1,000,000,000. So you could see a five percentage increase in that regard.But a lot of economic development here outside of sports. The semiconductor chip manufacturing that's being conducted here in the state, something that President Biden talked about in his State of the Union address earlier this week. Remember, Intel, TSMC building their fab factories down here.The governor is excited about that. Jack Selby is excited about that. A lot happening. They're trying to give Austin a run for their money.DAVID BRIGGS: All right, quickly, I know you're a big fan. I know you think Philly is going to win. Give me a score. And what's the particular edge you think that Philly has over KC?KEVIN CIRILLI: All right, well, one, the fans. That's the edge, clearly. Two, they're going to essentially be playing in a home stadium. And, three, I'm thinking it'll be 27-24, Birds. I do think it's going to be a nail-biter. I heard you compare-- I heard you compare the Chiefs to Hogwarts. And I got to say, that is not the case, OK? Like the Eagles are Gryffindor, let me just put it that way. How's that?DAVID BRIGGS: First off, it was Patrick Mahomes is Harry Potter, has a bit of wizardry to him. Let's get it straight, Cirilli, all right?KEVIN CIRILLI: OK.DAVID BRIGGS: Good luck, brother. Enjoy it out there, OK?KEVIN CIRILLI: I appreciate it. That's awesome, awesome. I'll talk to you guys later. Thank you for having me.DAVID BRIGGS: All right, we're going to be taking a look now at some prop bets through the hour. Our Josh Schafer, he is our resident junky gambler. And he's going to break it down for us. I need some prop action. So what do you got?JOSH SCHAFER: We've got some fun ones here for you guys. We're going to start with Gatorade, which sounds like it's a hot topic for you two. And--DAVID BRIGGS: Yep.SEANA SMITH: Yes.JOSH SCHAFER: --I'm not going to lie, where did we pick? Who had red? Someone had red, right?DAVID BRIGGS: I took red.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, all right, you're with 8% of the handle here. That's plus 450 odds, Dave. So what you're looking at is where people are betting. So the most bet on Gatorade is yellow. 40% of the money is on yellow. And then you've got 20% of the money on blue, 20% of the money on orange.SEANA SMITH: That's my pick.JOSH SCHAFER: My pick-- I've got to step out of the way here-- is purple. Because I think Riptide Rush is the best Gatorade. And that's simply all I'm picking off of. There is some fun stats, if you guys want to go deep into this, right? Orange is the most picked. That's probably why Seana picked it. It's come up the most times since 2001.SEANA SMITH: I did my research.JOSH SCHAFER: And then yellow is also very popular right now among Eagles fans. So yellow was poured on Doug Pederson at the NFC Championship and the Super Bowl the last time the Eagles won. And Nick Sirianni two weeks ago had yellow Gatorade poured on him.DAVID BRIGGS: Oh.SEANA SMITH: I love that flavor.JOSH SCHAFER: We like yellow.DAVID BRIGGS: That's a solid scoop. There are some of these colors, Josh, that are a little bit in between, that there's like a greenish-blue. You know what I mean, that greenish-blue Gatorade.JOSH SCHAFER: Green-blue, well, we've got yellow-green.DAVID BRIGGS: Right, I'm looking at it--JOSH SCHAFER: We're going to have to call back up Jason Robins--SEANA SMITH: You're the one that's disputing the color of Gatorade.JOSH SCHAFER: --and dispute what color you had. Because yellow-green is the only unclear one here. Then you've got red-pink.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, that would be pretty clear.DAVID BRIGGS: But like, pink?SEANA SMITH: That's going to be a tough one to argue with.DAVID BRIGGS: Is that even a Gatorade?JOSH SCHAFER: That's why I'm going with purple. It's simple.DAVID BRIGGS: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: I don't know if it's ever happened.SEANA SMITH: I'm going orange.JOSH SCHAFER: But I'm going purple.DAVID BRIGGS: OK, all right, that's a good job.JOSH SCHAFER: All right, coming up, Eagles defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh who competes for his second Super Bowl ring on Sunday also boasts an impressive investing portfolio. He'll tell us more about it next.[MUSIC PLAYING]No shortage of storylines ahead of Super Bowl LVII. We've got the first ever meeting of Black quarterbacks, the first ever meeting between two brothers in Jason and Travis Kelce, and the third Super Bowl with three different teams from one of the greatest defensive linemen in NFL history. I'm talking about Eagles five time all-pro defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, who joins us now.Great of you to find the time during this busy week, my friend. So three teams, three Super Bowls. What makes this experience different for you?NDAMUKONG SUH: The experience each and every single year is different. No matter what team you're with, whether you've been with the team for 10 years or two years, every year is different. Every team is different and always going to continue to be that way, unfortunately. But that's part of the business. But it's exciting to have an opportunity to get back to the Super Bowl and have another opportunity to win.SEANA SMITH: Ndamukong, it's great to see. You're playing for my hometown team. So I am clearly rooting for you on Sunday. You're playing this time for Nick Sirianni. Who's not that much older than you. From your time with the Eagles this year, what have you learned from him just in terms of the leadership and his success that he's clearly having so early in his career?NDAMUKONG SUH: He's a great coach. Having played against him last year in the playoffs when I was down in Tampa and we took care of business that first round, but he's a great coach. He understands all the different nuances, has an opportunity to be a leader on the offensive side of the ball, but also understand the defense and how we want to particularly rush up front and get off the quarterbacks. And I think from the standpoint of his leadership, he just understands, it's all about keeping detail-oriented process, focusing on the things that count the most when it comes to situational ball and going from there.DAVID BRIGGS: I mentioned that quarterback match-up, which is so intriguing. Tell me about the key to defending, to stopping, to containing Patrick Mahomes. And if I could ask a double, you shut down your quarterback, Jalen Hurts, this time last year a bit earlier. How much has he grown in that one year?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, we'll start first with Patrick Mahomes. He's a great talent, very, very elusive, to say the least. I've been going against him in years past, but most notably in the 2021 Super Bowl that I won with Tampa. He's just always extending the play. And that's something that as a defensive line that we have to focus on.There's no end in rushing. Until that ball either incomplete or you got a sack and he's fully, fully down, you've got to keep rushing. Because he loves to extend plays and make things happen and getting balls to the receivers, especially 87.And so when it comes to transitioning to Jalen, I think Jalen has grown tremendously. He's found a way to not only hurt people with his feet, but as well as his arm. And I think the GM Howard did an amazing job defining great talent around him and adding some pieces, for example, AJ Brown.DAVID BRIGGS: Boy, has he come a long way in just one year. Speaking of, you've come a long way over your career. You were once voted the dirtiest player in the league. You've been fined more than $600,000. But, recently, you played peacekeeper against the Niners. How do you think you have evolved over these 13 years? Or were you just misunderstood?NDAMUKONG SUH: I've always said it, if people ever take the time to really get to understand me and get to know me and really truthfully be unbiased when it comes to my personality and my character, they wouldn't have made those votes and they wouldn't have had that particular characteristics around me as a person. I've always been some sort of a peacekeeper or, if you want to call it that. But I know Trent well. So when he saw me getting in front of him and it wasn't about anything other than the game is pretty much over, let's move on, let's get to the next play and go from there.SEANA SMITH: You've clearly had a lot of success on the field. You've also had a lot of success off the field as well. I know you have invested in over 30 companies. One of your mentors is actually Warren Buffett. Talk to us just about that relationship, the biggest lessons that you've learned from him, and how that's really helped shape your investment career.NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think the biggest thing that I've learned from Mr. Buffett is just being able to have good people around you. And as you see, he has multiple companies. He trusts those folks and puts them in places and empowers them.And that's something that I like to do, not only in my foundation with my family and my wife, but also being to be able to empower people, whether it's in the real estate realm, having a development company, being able to build multifamily housing, being able to take care of other people and finding ways to find affordable housing for folks that should be afforded to them at all times. And it's tough in this day and age, especially going through the pandemic. You saw that it's probably its worst. And so hopefully we can continue as a collective to get better in that space. But when it comes to investing, I just have fun with it.I love learning. I love being able to sit down with folks. I actually sat down with one of our owners yesterday to have a great conversation of how he built his company with KKR. I've done some work with them. And so it's a fun opportunity for me to just be able to build relationships and learn from folks and then being able to be involved and be hands-on.SEANA SMITH: You mentioned your involvement in real estate there a moment ago, some of your initiatives, how you're looking to tackle housing affordability. From your perspective from your involvement in the space over the last several years, what more do you think needs to be done? And how do we better address this issue?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think it's-- I think one of the key things that we could do, especially when it comes to affordable housing, is kind of take it out of the city and state's hands. If we privatize it in a manner and incentivize private real estate people, it'd be great. Because if you really look at it and break down the numbers from a perspective how I look at it, it's one of the most expensive housing just because of the rules and regulations that go into it, which I understand and respect. But if we potentially looked at it being privatized, I think would be a lot faster and to be able to be something that is afforded to people a lot quicker.SEANA SMITH: You're involved in over 30 companies here. I think a lot of people at home are asking, how do you have the time for this? How involved are you with each investment?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think I'm very, very involved in every single day, finding time to be able to do it. But it's really being able to compartmentalize things. Obviously, playing football pulls me away from it a fair amount. But I've been at it for 13 years. I understand how I need to study, how I need to focus, even going into a very important week like this week with the Super Bowl, I can still look at things. I probably won't as detailed and push it off just a week or two.But, for me, I still look at opportunities and find time to do it. And I think one of the greatest things that helps you keep you sharp. Because if you get overloaded in one particular thing, then you don't have the capacity to go and look at other things and find ways to keep your mind sharp when it comes to, one, playing football and knowing what you need to accomplish.DAVID BRIGGS: That is a super sharp man and a likely future Hall of Famer Ndamukong Suh. Well, if you don't have a ticket to the Super Bowl, you're not too late. And the trends are, in fact, going in your favor. So maybe be patient. You will, though, have to shell out a ton of cash to go to this game.We're taking a look at the prices all through this week. The cheapest tickets selling for $4,300. That was Monday, according to StubHub. But that number gradually declining through the week, the opposite trend that we usually see-- dropping $200 Tuesday, a huge drop of $500 on Wednesday. And we're finishing out the week with the cheapest ticket costing $3,100. Still a ton of cheddar, but it's come down considerably from the beginning of the week.All that data is for the cheapest ticket to the game. That's in the nosebleeds. If you want the good seats, if you want to bring a friend that you're trying to impress, you've got to really shell out. And here's the cost.You can sit in section 138M, row 44, main end zone. Tickets are a cool $87,000 each. So you and a friend will pay over $174,000 to see the game. You better-- well, we won't go on.Some other trends we're watching, Eagles fans are outselling Chiefs fans by more than double, according to StubHub. That fits what we're hearing from Kevin Cirilli on the ground in Arizona. The ticket vendor seeing a last-minute sales spike in Mexico, the top, number two top selling country outside of the US, behind Canada. And most US buyers are coming from these five states-- no surprise, Pennsylvania, California, New Jersey, Arizona, and Florida. Chiefs fans in Missouri and Kansas accounting for a combined 8% of sales. What's going on, Chiefs fans? You've got a couple of days to try to change that dynamic.Coming up, Apple will be in the spotlight at Super Bowl LVII. Find out what a big Sunday could mean for that company. And we asked you if Rihanna will bring out any surprise guests during the Apple-sponsored Super Bowl halftime show. Roughly 60% of you said ""yes."" We will discuss coming up who that might be. Some of you made predictions. We've got A$AP Rocky, Miley Cyrus, JAY-Z, even Beyoncé as a possible guest. More on what else to expect coming up next.[MUSIC PLAYING]SEANA SMITH: A huge part of the Super Bowl is the halftime show, with many people tuning into the game just for that big performance. This year, Apple is the official sponsor and Rihanna is taking the stage with her first live performance in years. I know I'm very excited for the game. Allie Canal is very excited for the game. She's on the set. Now you don't have to look any further than that jersey that she's wearing for who she's rooting for this weekend.ALLIE CANAL: Go Birds. Go Birds.DAVID BRIGGS: She's chair dancing, man.SEANA SMITH: She's chair dancing.ALLIE CANAL: I'm, like, in such a great mood. I'm so excited.SEANA SMITH: There we go. We're ready.ALLIE CANAL: Right.JOSH SCHAFER: You might have to hide on Monday. I don't know.SEANA SMITH: Lots of hype here. All right, Al, let's talk about the halftime show, right? Because lots of money going into it, lots of hype ahead of this show. What can we expect? And how expensive is it for these musicians?ALLIE CANAL: Well, the NFL, you know, famously doesn't pay the halftime performers. But it does pay for all the upfront costs. So think about the stages, the background dancers, the lighting. That's all the NFL. And that could amount to a pretty hefty price tag, around $17 million.That was a reported cost for last year's show. You know RiRi. She's going to want the production value. It could be even more for that. And for Rihanna, she was asked to do the halftime show back in 2019. She said no in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick.Now she's back. She said she's ready for this moment. She's apparently changed her setlist 39 times. So I am ready for this. And it's going to be very big for her in terms of her streams on those music platforms like Spotify, like Apple Music.If you take a look at the past, last year's performance, which featured Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem, and 50 Cent, each and every one of those performers saw a boost to their personal catalogs. Dr. Dre saw 183% increase in album sales, a 105% bump in on-demand streams. Mary J. Blige, her album sales jumped almost 1,000%, with Snoop Dogg's rising 361%.And then if you take a look at the five years prior, we have The Weeknd, J.Lo, Shakira, Maroon 5, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, all an uptick in digital downloads, album sales, Spotify streams. So the exposure here is unbelievable. And that's really why it's worth it for a lot of these artists. And we've seen an uptick in the amount of viewers that are actually tuning in and watching this halftime show. Last year, for example, viewership was up 7% compared to 2021 with more than 130 million people tuning in. So we'll have to see if Rihanna can get those numbers up even higher, which I think she can.DAVID BRIGGS: Do you really?ALLIE CANAL: I do. People are excited about this.DAVID BRIGGS: I know, I know. I'm excited. Don't get me wrong. A lot of people want to know, opening song and special guest. We've seen a lot of that in recent years. What do you got?ALLIE CANAL: Opening song, I've got ""Run This Town."" That just feels to me like an opening song. Special guest, I think it has to be JAY-Z. JAY-Z's Roc Nation is a producer of the halftime show. Rihanna is also signed to the Roc Nation label. So I feel like he's going to help out his girl. He's featured on a lot of her songs. So that's my prediction. That's where I'm going with it.DAVID BRIGGS: We're going to go around the horn real quick. I'm going to go totally outside the box. I think she is unconventional. I don't think she's going to do anybody predictable. It's going to be a country star. It's going to be like Zach Bryan--SEANA SMITH: That would be a curveball.DAVID BRIGGS: --or Zac Brown Band.JOSH SHAFER: Chris Stapleton stays after the National Anthem?DAVID BRIGGS: Oh, that'd be amazing, my favorite singer of all time. But I think someone-- Sugarland, someone like that. Unconventional, brings in a different portion of the audience.SEANA SMITH: I've got to agree with Allie. I was going to go JAY-Z before we even heard her pick. I think that makes the most sense. We know he has shown a little bit of resistance against the Super Bowl halftime show in the past. I would not be surprised if we see him on that stage on Sunday.JOSH SCHAFER: They always make fun of on the sports shows when everyone picks the same team, right, and we all have the same little icon on the bottom. Because I'm going to pick JAY-Z too.SEANA SMITH: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: So that's when they normally say that's not going to happen. But I don't know. It's my favorite song. ""Run This Town"" is my favorite song. JAY-Z is, obviously, very involved, as Allie said. So that was my pick before everyone else picked. So we've got to stay with it.SEANA SMITH: All right, I like ""Umbrella.""DAVID BRIGGS: Wow.ALLIE CANAL: She's predicting ""Umbrella.""SEANA SMITH: ""Ella-ella-ella.""ALLIE CANAL: ""Umbrella"" as a finale-- I could see a bunch of umbrellas out there.SEANA SMITH: Yes, exactly. It could be a good one. We'll see.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, I like that.SEANA SMITH: Clearly, we are very excited for the halftime show. David, you've got to jump on board here, you know?DAVID BRIGGS: I am, man.SEANA SMITH: We're going to get you to become a Rihanna fan.ALLIE CANAL: He's such a boomer. Dave is a boomer.SEANA SMITH: Sooner rather than later.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm gonna be honest, that's when I get my Buffalo chicken dip, man, whatever.SEANA SMITH: All right.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm here for the game.ALLIE CANAL: OK, boomer.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, thanks so much. Well, Apple, like we've been talking about, replacing Pepsi as the official sponsor for this year's Super Bowl halftime show. $250 million deal spans five years. This is according to the ""Sports Business Journal."" Let's discuss what this means for the tech giant.For that, we want to bring back Dan Ives, Wedbush managing director, its senior equity analyst. Dan, it's great to see you here. So, clearly, a huge move for Apple, now being the sponsor of the halftime show. How big of a win do you think it is for the company?Dan, I think you're muted. And we love the Eagles jersey, by the way. Got it?DAN IVES: OK, so part of what Cook and Cupertino are focused on is really on the NFL and live sports. And this is an important part of, ultimately, what we see Apple doing more and more of over the coming years. I think it's a huge win. And especially in this macro period, Apple doing this further flexes the muscles.SEANA SMITH: Dan, when you talked about Apple here going forward, I think lots of questions just about the amount of money that they have spent or are going to spend on the halftime shows over the next several years. When you see that, does that make sense for them, given the fact that there's no guaranteed return on this type of investment?DAN IVES: But Apple, they're tacticians in terms of how they spend. And this is something they don't just do quickly. And if you look at the history, I mean, they have basically made big bets that have been home successes. And I also I think at this juncture, it's very important that they're investing at a time where some others maybe be are pulling back. And I think that's an important time, especially going into more iPhone launches as well as some other technologies I'd expect them to introduce over the coming months.DAVID BRIGGS: You thought they were going to take a big swing at the Sunday NFL Ticket package. What happened there? Did they end up making a bid? Did it just get out of the range they wanted to spend? And do you think they'll take another pass at an NBA, NFL type of property?DAN IVES: Yeah, and, look, I think there was significant involvement. I think some reports have talked about it. I just think it got to a point where they're only going to spend a certain amount. Ultimately, they were not going to go to that level.But live sports is the key to streaming. I mean, that is one of the keys for Apple when it comes to the streaming piece. I don't think they're stopping here. I think they're going to go after major sports over the coming years. When you look at that content strategy, I mean, it just further highlights whether it's streaming in terms of on TV or what we see with Apple Music, services, under the radar, has actually morphed into a pretty massive business.DAVID BRIGGS: How much will live sports mean for this tech battle? We just discussed Apple. You've got Google who made the big play for Sunday NFL Ticket, $2 and 1/2 billion a year, rumored to be per year, and then Amazon, of course, already in with Thursday Night Football. Or is it not that important in terms of the overall growth investor story?DAN IVES: I think it's a golden jewel, I mean, in terms of what big tech is focused on with streaming. Live sports is what is ultimately-- and that's why the value continues to go up. Because that's just traditional media. I think big tech is going to take significant bets on live sports over the coming year, especially as you look into '23, '24, '25, '26, a lot sort of come up for renewal. And I think streaming is going to be a big part of that over the coming years.SEANA SMITH: Dan, we don't have to ask you who you're rooting for, very clear. Got to ask you about the score. What do you think it's going to be on Sunday?DAN IVES: I see Eagles by 10.SEANA SMITH: OK.DAN IVES: I think, ultimately, yeah, I think between Hurts and that defense, I see a lot of happy fans in the 215 area code.SEANA SMITH: I hope you are right. 215 area code is my hometown. Dan Ives, great to see you. Thanks so much.DAN IVES: Thank you.SEANA SMITH: All right, Josh has another bet that he's watching over there. What do you got now, Josh?JOSH SCHAFER: All right, guys, we've got the coin toss now. You can bet on a 50/50 coin toss. I know, how exciting, right? But people will do it.And we asked our viewers what they picked. And they like heads. We had 55% or just about 55% of people say that they would vote heads or bet heads. But then when you look actually at where the money is right now at a place like Caesars Sportsbook, the money's on tails.58% of people betting on tails. You can see the odds right there, -102 and -102. Of course, even odds because, again, it's a 50/50 bet. Now, if you want to go fun stats, four out of the last five Super Bowls were heads.DAVID BRIGGS: That is nice research.SEANA SMITH: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: So I don't know if that makes you think your tails is due or--SEANA SMITH: What would you bet, Josh?JOSH SCHAFER: I would go heads.SEANA SMITH: You would go heads?JOSH SCHAFER: Yes, in a former life, I did the coin toss all the time. I always went heads. You've got to play the same one every time. I think you have to do a strategy on a 50/50.SEANA SMITH: Stick with it.DAVID BRIGGS: Real quickly, I want your pick with the spread. It's Philly by 1 and 1/2. Who do you got?JOSH SCHAFER: Dave, I have a lot of bets set up. Why don't we talk about that in about 10 minutes?DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, all right. Nice tease.JOSH SCHAFER: Coming up next, the Super Bowl ad landscape is getting a makeover. Find out why sports betting platforms like FanDuel could be a winning bet on Sunday.[MUSIC PLAYING]- It's called the kick of destiny.- What the heck is kick of destiny?- Good luck. See you in Phoenix. Don't miss.- Oh, boy.DAVID BRIGGS: Oh, it's going to be live, 45 yard field goal for Gronk FanDuel's Kick of Destiny campaign starring Rob Gronkowski, getting plenty of buzz ahead of the big game. Who else is getting bang for their 7 million bucks? John Connors is the co-founder and CEO of marketing and communications agency Boathouse. He joins us now. John, good to see you, man.So last year was labeled the Crypto Bowl. How significant a presence is gambling making? Did they replace crypto?JOHN CONNORS: Yeah, I think to your point, this year is going to be the-- you know, the booze, chips, and gambling bowl all combined. And I love the fact that you led with Gronk.SEANA SMITH: Well, speaking of it being the booze, chips, and gambling bowl, let's talk about the gambling aspect of it with the booze. Because Molson Coors is back in the Super Bowl after more than 30 years. They're teaming up with DraftKings. And what's interesting about this initiative is that they're allowing users to bet on who they think, for example, what beer is going to appear first, what dog is going to be used in the commercial. From your perspective, just the engagement aspect of this, how smart is that? And what do you think we'll hear from other alcohol brands this Sunday?JOHN CONNORS: Yeah, I mean, I think, to your point, you can't separate gambling from the Super Bowl, right? And so the ability to make that brand connection and to get that engagement, these days, everyone's trying to figure out how they can drive up that engagement value, how they can drive up that social value, how they can drive up the conversation. And so I think FanDuel and DraftKings have done masterful jobs, sort of between the Gronk bet and the betting on Coors Miller and all the other pieces of driving up as much conversation as possible.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, the live element of the FanDuel ad, have we ever seen anything like that? And how big do you think that will pay off?JOHN CONNORS: I think we've seen things like that, but not in the Super Bowl, right? So I think at this level, I mean, I think you've seen a lot of categories try and launch a lot of new ideas all the way back to Apple in 1984. It's always a massive platform for new launches. And I think as those two exchange blows to sort of capture attention, capture volume, I think it's a masterful play.SEANA SMITH: Well, John, for the big ads, they're pricing out just around $7 million for 30 seconds. We're seeing many companies team up. Like we've been talking about one GM and Netflix in this ad starring Will Ferrell.WILL FERRELL: General Motors is going electric. And Netflix is joining by including more EVs in their movies and shows. The least they can do. So, if you're going to get swarmed by an army of the dead, why not get swarmed in an EV? Ew. I said no biting.- Oh.WILL FERRELL: Or if you're being voluntarily kidnapped, why not be kidnapped in an EV? What's that scent? Is it pine?SEANA SMITH: So GM teaming up with Netflix, trying to push their EVs to make them more mainstream. What do you think of this strategy, a big streamer teaming up with an automaker?JOHN CONNORS: I think you're seeing-- well, last year's automakers were an interesting strategy. It was majority of electric vehicles when none of them had the electric vehicles yet. So they were all teasing sort of what was coming down the road. I think you're seeing that collaboration piece across the Super Bowl this year. I think, you know, the marketers like to follow the artists. And the artists have been doing collabs for a long time.And I think we're just seeing a significant number. As you know as well, there's a little more safety in a collaboration. Sort of two teams, two big brands like Netflix and GM going at it together just drives it a little bit more safety for that chief marketing officer.SEANA SMITH: All right, John Connors, thanks so much for joining us. I know a lot of us are very excited for all the ads that we will be seeing in just two days from now.JOHN CONNORS: Go Eagles.SEANA SMITH: Well, coming up, the Super Bowl Indicator. We'll tell you how stocks may perform next week based on the big game's outcome. Stay with us.[MUSIC PLAYING]JOSH SCHAFER: Welcome back to our Super Bowl special here on Yahoo Finance. Normally, we talk plenty about market indicators on this show, like a 100-day moving average or how stocks perform in election years. But some say even sports can tell us where Mr. Market is headed over the next year. Ryan Detrick over at Carson Research recently released the latest data for what's known as the Super Bowl Indicator, which tells us how markets perform depending on the outcome of the big game.So let's keep it simple to start. Markets have historically performed better after a team from the NFC conference wins than if the AFC wins. You can see here that's 10% for the NFC, an average return 6.9% for the AFC. So, really, people should be rooting for this indicator for the Eagles, who are in the NFC. That would give us a better return per the data.Now that was a historical chart, of course, going all the way back and counting all outcomes. But both these teams have also won Super Bowls in the past. So the Eagles have won one Super Bowl just a couple of years ago. And the S&amp;P 500 fell 6.2% that year.The Chiefs have won two Super Bowls. When you average those together, that's up 8.1%. So not a lot to take there, only three games. I don't think that's my favorite one. Let's get to my favorite one.Market bulls should really be rooting for a blowout on Sunday. So if you take a look here, the average return of the S&amp;P 500 is 8.5%. Now, when there's a single-digit win in the Super Bowl, it goes up 4.9% on average. When there's a double-digit win in the Super Bowl, it goes up 10.9% on average. But when there's a blowout and someone wins by 21 points or more, there's a blowout in the markets too. And the S&amp;P 500 rises on average 13.6% that year.So I don't know about you guys, I might root for an Eagles blowout on Sunday.SEANA SMITH: Heck yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Maybe my 401(k) can recover from last year a little bit.DAVID BRIGGS: Philly fan here is going to root for that. That will not happen. They could have a comfortable win, but not a blowout win.JOSH SCHAFER: Well, keep that thought.DAVID BRIGGS: Where is the public money at?JOSH SCHAFER: The public money? Let's take a look at the public money, Dave. So we know the spread is 1 and 1/2, right, coming into this game. So the Eagles are favored by 1 and 1/2. And the public money right now is on the Eagles.So 69% of the handle on DraftKings Sportsbook is currently on the Eagles to cover that 1 and 1/2 point spread. So that means they'd have to win by 2. And then where I really want to bet on Sunday, I think, because I love the totals, is 51. So 51 is the total. And that's where people are betting right now.Here's my favorite bet, though. Travis Kelce, first touchdown. I bet it earlier in the playoffs. It hit. I love the first touchdown bets. It's really exciting to watch the first couple drives and see it. Plus 700, I'm all over it, Dave.Seana, what are you watching on Sunday? Give us a bet. You've got to give us a pick.SEANA SMITH: All right, well, I went in with a parlay. And I stole this from Ross Tucker, full disclosure. But I've got to give credit where credit's due. And I liked it. I liked it a lot.So let's talk about it. I think Jalen Hurts is going to score a touchdown. I think Haason Reddick is also going to get a sack. And I also think that the Eagles are going to win. And I'm confident in it.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, Tucker's a pretty good gambler. He's no dummy. I've got a dumb bet. Because these are dumb bets when you have multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple things that have to happen. Patrick Mahomes over 1 and 1/2 touchdowns, Travis Kelce over 50 yards, AJ Brown over 50 yards, DeVonta Smith-- receiver for the Eagles-- under 63 and 1/2 yards, and Jalen Hurts over 40 yards rushing. Full disclosure, I also stole mine from a 15-year-old who lives in my house. But he's pretty good at this.JOSH SCHAFER: It seems like we bet a lot on the ankle injuries there and the lower extremities. How healthy is Jalen Hurts? How healthy is Patrick Mahomes? To talk football a little bit, I'm nervous about some of those prop bets. I've heard some--DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, you don't like it? You don't like it?JOSH SCHAFER: I don't know.DAVID BRIGGS: Well, look, the thing-- now, I say a dumb bet because those have such tremendous odds that they lure in a lot of people because they pay off well. But no one ever wins them.JOSH SCHAFER: They have the highest hold rate for sportsbooks. Sportsbooks want you to bet those same game parlays because they make the most money off of them. But coming up, we're talking about inflation. It's crashing your Super Bowl party. Find out how much you'll need to shell out for food and drinks when we come back.[MUSIC PLAYING]SEANA SMITH: What good is watching football if you don't have a bevy of snacks and also drinks to enjoy during the big game? But this year, you've got to keep a very close eye on that price tag. Because when it comes to checkout, some fan favorites are much pricier than they've been in years past. Allie Canal joining us now with a closer look at what we will be paying this weekend. Allie, what do you got?ALLIE CANAL: Wow, the good news is, Seana, if you want some chicken wings-- which we have on our set now-- that's actually cheaper, 22% cheaper compared to this time last year, $2.65 versus $3.38 per pound the week of Super Bowl 2022. And that's due to a larger supply of wings, decreased freight costs, all of that driving prices lower. And if you want to get a little bit fancier than wings, we have sirloin steak prices. That's also down by about $1 per pound. I feel like you really are a steak guy, Philly cheesesteak maybe?DAVID BRIGGS: Not during the Super Bowl.SEANA SMITH: Philly cheesesteak--ALLIE CANAL: Philly cheesesteak, though-- I think that could be an option.JOSH SCHAFER: You can't have a steak during the Super Bowl.ALLIE CANAL: I know, so you probably want to stick with the wings. Plus, 22% versus, you know, versus the $1 less, I think you go with the wings here. But chips and guac, avocados, they're also down, which is nice. But something that's up is your beer, 11% higher.SEANA SMITH: Wow.DAVID BRIGGS: And they've seen demand slip because of that towards the end of the year, yeah.ALLIE CANAL: And I think it's interesting too that soft drinks as well, they're up 25% So it's actually cheaper to get a little buzz going than just stay sober during the game. But we were talking about--SEANA SMITH: You need another reason to go out and get a drink during the big game.JOSH SHAFER: In the spirit of that--ALLIE CANAL: In the spirit of that, but talking about spirits, though, that's actually only up 2% while wine is up 3%. So maybe a little sangria action if you don't want the beer. That's a cheaper option.DAVID BRIGGS: Not bad.ALLIE CANAL: But, overall, I think for the Super Bowl people, people want to drink their beer.DAVID BRIGGS: Wings versus boneless wings, Allie. You are the expert. We have them both here. Seana and I are team boneless.SEANA SMITH: We are.ALLIE CANAL: I'm not Team Boneless. I am--SEANA SMITH: We're on a little island by ourselves.ALLIE CANAL: I'm bone-in, but I'm flats over drumsticks all day.SEANA SMITH: Oh, yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah.SEANA SMITH: What about you?JOSH SCHAFER: No, I'm absolutely bone-in. I am of the take that if you have boneless wings, they're actually just--ALLIE CANAL: That just looks sad.JOSH SCHAFER: --those are chicken nuggets. Those are chicken nuggets. Those are chicken nuggets.DAVID BRIGGS: Josh, Seana, Allie--SEANA SMITH: I will eat them all to myself.DAVID BRIGGS: --thank you, guys. That'll do it for our big game coverage. Enjoy the weekend. Enjoy the Super Bowl. And we'll see you on Monday.ALLIE CANAL: Go Birds.]"

121,3689fde4-009e-35e7-83f3-057f5a22adde,VLO,2023-02-12,Valero Energy Corporation's (NYSE:VLO) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-corporations-nyse-vlo-120038146.html,1676203238,STORY,['VLO'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Valero Energy's (NYSE:VLO) stock increased significantly by 6.8% over the past week. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Valero Energy's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Valero Energy How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Valero Energy is:50% = US$12b ÷ US$24b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.50 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Valero Energy's Earnings Growth And 50% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Valero Energy has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 33% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This probably laid the groundwork for Valero Energy's moderate 11% net income growth seen over the past five years.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Valero Energy's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 8.0% in the same period, which is great to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Valero Energy fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Valero Energy Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Valero Energy has a low three-year median payout ratio of 17%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 83% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.Additionally, Valero Energy has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 41% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 11%, over the same period.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Valero Energy's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

122,cfcde85d-7167-3c9a-bff5-bfc0be4f8063,UNH,2023-02-12,Return Trends At UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) Aren't Appealing,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/return-trends-unitedhealth-group-nyse-110020869.html,1676199620,STORY,['UNH'],"[Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at UnitedHealth Group's (NYSE:UNH) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for UnitedHealth Group:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$28b ÷ (US$246b - US$89b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, UnitedHealth Group has an ROCE of 18%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Healthcare industry average of 9.8% it's much better. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for UnitedHealth Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering UnitedHealth Group here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has employed 77% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 18%. 18% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that UnitedHealth Group has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Story continuesOur Take On UnitedHealth Group's ROCEThe main thing to remember is that UnitedHealth Group has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 132% return to those who've held over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.Like most companies, UnitedHealth Group does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.While UnitedHealth Group isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

123,caae09da-85cc-3382-b1ae-fde744eee8c9,UNH,2023-02-12,The 7 Safest Stocks You Can Buy in February 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-safest-stocks-buy-february-160328041.html,1675872208,STORY,['UNH'],"[With the economy and the stock market not fully out of the woods, my suggestion is to focus on the safest stocks at the moment. With the most recent statements from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggesting that interest rates will keep rising, and that a “Fed pivot” isn’t just around the corner, the overall market’s strong performance over the past month could give way to another broad market sell-off.That in mind, now is the time to cycle back into safe stocks. Offering lower volatility, steady dividends, and the potential for gradual appreciation, these seven safest stocks could also receive a short-term lift, if today’s “risk-on” investors seek safer harbors.HSYHershey$236.29LMTLockheed Martin$469.64NEENextEra Energy$75.96PEPPepsiCo$170.78PGProcter &amp; Gamble$139.21PMPhilip Morris$101.56UNHUnitedHealth$480.89InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHershey (HSY)Source: ShutterstockShares of Hershey (NYSE:HSY) have continued to perform strongly. Shares stayed in the green during 2022, as HSY’s underlying business continued to “crush it,” despite challenges such as inflationary pressures. So far in 2023, HSY stock has continued to perform well, even as investors opt for the riskiest stocks rather than the safest stocks. However, if sentiment soon changes again, Hershey may not necessarily join in on the sell-off.  In fact, if the company continues reporting strong earnings growth, as it did in its latest quarterly results, shares could keep climbing higher.Besides appreciation potential, and very low volatility (HSY’s beta, or volatility compared to the overall market is 0.35). This stock also provides investors with a steady, growing dividend (1.71% forward yield). The company has raised its payout by an average of 8.74% annually over the past five years.Lockheed Martin (LMT)An F-16 and an F-35 model at the background, at the Lockheed Martin exhibition stand in Thessaloniki International Fair.Source: Giannis Papanikos / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) isn’t just a defense stock, it’s a defensive stock as well. With the recession-resistant nature of its business, it’s a high quality stock to buy and hold in all markets. While shares initially pulled back at the start of 2023, shares in this low-beta (0.68) stock are bouncing back.Story continuesTo some extent, this LMT stock rebound may be happening on the heels of a recent analyst double-upgrade. On Feb. 6, Credit Suisse’s Scott Deuschle raised his rating on LMT from “underperform” to “outperform,” basing his decision to upgrade on factors such as the defense contractor’s rising book-to-bill ratio, a sign of growth re-acceleration.Shares could potentially move higher in the coming year, in tandem with this expected earnings growth. This safe stock also offers investors steady returns, via its 2.56% dividend. LMT has a 20-year track record of dividend growth.NextEra Energy (NEE)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockIt’s no secret that many of the safest stocks are utilities stocks. Yet among scores of choices, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) may be your best bet. Yes, NEE’s beta (0.44) is on par with most utility stocks in the sector. Shares in this Florida-based electric power company also sell at a valuation premium to other major names in the sector.So then, what exactly makes NEE stock a standout among utilities? That would be its high exposure to the renewable energy megatrend. As InvestorPlace’s Josh Enomoto argued last month, NEE’s clean energy business will keep driving growth, which explains why the stock is a favorite among sell-side analysts.In turn, continued earnings growth likely means continued dividend growth. While offering a lower yield (2.25%) than peers, NEE has raised its payout by an average of 11.6% annually over the past five years.PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockThe consumer staples sector is another area chock full of safe stocks. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is one to consider adding as a safe harbor play. Sure, you may be thinking, why PEP rather than Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock?Yes, PEP stock and KO stock are similar in terms of their main business (soft drink), as well as stock-related metrics like beta (0.57 for PEP, 0.56 for KO) and valuation (mid-20s earnings multiple for both). Still, something else may give PEP the edge in this “cola stock war.”PEP and KO are each dividend kings, and KO does sport a slightly higher yield (2.93%, versus PEP’s 2.68%). However, raising its payout by an average of 7.4% over the past five years, versus an average of 3.53% for Coca-Cola, a higher level of dividend growth may enable PEP to outperform its longstanding rival going forward.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comProcter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a blue chip stock straight out of central casting. A more than century-old business, shares in this household products powerhouse have rewarded investors for generations, with steady dividends and growth.Even today, owning PG stock can provide your portfolio with solid returns. Investors seeking safety should appreciate its super-low beta of 0.4. Although shares may seem pricey, at around 24.5 times earnings, PG is likely to maintain this valuation, as it continues to consistently grow earnings.Current sell-side estimates call for earnings growth of around 8.2% next fiscal year (ending June 2024), and 9% in FY 2025. Add in PG’s 2.58% dividend, which has increased in each of the past 66 years, and it’s clear that Procter &amp; Gamble shares are in a strong position to provide investors with satisfactory returns, with much lower volatility than the overall stock market.Philip Morris (PM)packs of cigarettes in convenience store rackSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.comAmong top tobacco stocks, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) could be the safest in the bunch. Although it trades at a higher valuation, and a slightly higher beta than, say, its former parent company Altria Group (NYSE:MO), the company’s greater level of success so far with going “smoke free” may give its shares an extra degree of safety.As I argued recently, PM’s IQOS heated tobacco product, plus its recent purchase of smokeless tobacco and nicotine products maker Swedish Match, give it far greater exposure to growing segments of the tobacco industry. This could outweigh any possible declines in its legacy cigarette business, if the smoking rate keeps dropping.In addition to greater growth potential, PM stock also offers investors a solid dividend (forward yield of 4.97%). This dividend has grown steadily, increasing by an average of 3.62% annually over the past five years.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)UNH Stock Have Four More YearsSource: ShutterstockSelling off recently, on news of a lower-than-expected increase in Medicare Advantage payments this year, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) may not be acting like a safe stock right now.However, when looking on a longer timeframe, UNH stock remains less volatile than the overall stock market, with a beta of 0.69. This provider of health insurance and related services is not only still a safe stock. UnitedHealth Group remains a high-quality growth stock as well.Analyst forecasts continue to call for UNH to grow its earnings by double-digits over the next two years. Chances are that achieving this will result in a similarly-sized move higher for shares. Along with earnings growth, UNH offers investors the opportunity for dividend growth as well. While its current payout may seem low (1.39%), UnitedHealth has raised its dividend by an average of 17.4% annually over the past five years.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel held MO.

If America does well and those leading banks maintain their market share, those leading banks will likely do well in the long term.Some of the leading companies are what the financial media regards as 'Big Tech'. Those companies are huge profitable companies with substantial resources.Many of those big tech companies are also leaders in AI since they are the ones with the computing power, data, and financial resources.Companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are currently in an AI war, for instance. Late last year, OpenAI launched its ChatGPT AI chatbot which has offered substantial utility to many users even if it makes mistakes. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) previously invested $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019 and the company agreed to invest another $10 billion in 2023.Furthermore, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is planning to incorporate ChatGPT into Bing to potentially gain market share from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google.In response, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google is planning on launching multiple AI products this year, including its own AI search tool, Bard. Although Bard also makes mistakes, both will improve over time as the technology advances.Story continuesGiven its leading market share in cloud computing, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) likely will help power the computer processing of many AI applications in the future. Companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have invested substantial amounts into AI technologies and will likely have new AI incorporated products and services of their own in the future as well.Some other leading companies that the financial media likes are leading consumer staple conglomerates such as The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) that have long histories of increasing their annual dividends through multiple recessions.While the set-it-and-forget-it leading companies in the market have compelling qualities in the long term, they still have downside if the economy worsens or if their results do not meet expectations. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.AmazonPhoto by Bryan Angelo on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 10 Set-It-and-Forget-It Stocks to Buy According to Financial Media, we selected the stocks that have been highly regarded by the financial media as stocks that could do well in the long term.For those of you interested, check out 15 Stocks That Have Increased Their Dividends for Over 25 Years.10 Set-It-and-Forget-It Stocks to Buy According to Financial Media10.

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $285.44 billionBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is one of the 'big four' American banks with a market capitalization of $285.44 billion, ranking #9 on our list of 10 Set-It-and-Forget-It Stocks to Buy According to Financial Media. Given its scale and importance in the financial sector, many in the financial media view big banks like Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) as systematically important. Although being systemically important doesn't mean good returns, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) nevertheless does also have substantial normalized earnings power and management is returning capital back to shareholders with a dividend yield of 2.47% as of 2/10. On average, analysts expect the bank to earn $3.12 per share for 2022, $3.48 per share in 2023, $3.76 per share in 2024, and $4.23 per share in 2025.8. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $326.18 billionThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is viewed by many in the financial media as a Dividend Aristocrat or a stock that has raised its annual dividend for at least 25 straight years. In terms of its dividend, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has actually raised its annual dividend for 67 straight years, meaning the leading consumer staple has been financially strong enough to increase payouts through multiple recessions. Although higher inflation has been a headwind for demand for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) recently, the company has long term earnings power if inflation normalizes.7. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $413.70 billionJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is regarded by many in the financial media as one of America's best big banks given the company's strong profitability and arguably great CEO in Jamie Dimon. Like Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a systemically important institution, giving it more importance in the media. Although an economic slowdown or recession could decrease earnings in the near term, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has long term EPS growth potential given its earnings power and eventual stock buybacks which could begin as early as this year.6. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Market Capitalization as of 2/10: $423.94 billionJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is viewed by the financial media as another leading Dividend Aristocrat that has increased its annual dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. In Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s case, the healthcare conglomerate has actually increased its annual dividend 61 consecutive years. Although shares of the stock are down 5.45% in the last year, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) increased its full year 2022 sales by 1.3% year over year to $94.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 3.6% year over year to $10.15 per share. Shares currently trade for a forward P/E of 14.84, which could be attractive in terms of the long term if the conglomerate maintains its market share.Like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are set-it-and-forget-it stocks to buy according to financial media.

Offering lower volatility, steady dividends, and the potential for gradual appreciation, these seven safest stocks could also receive a short-term lift, if today’s “risk-on” investors seek safer harbors.HSYHershey$236.29LMTLockheed Martin$469.64NEENextEra Energy$75.96PEPPepsiCo$170.78PGProcter &amp; Gamble$139.21PMPhilip Morris$101.56UNHUnitedHealth$480.89InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHershey (HSY)Source: ShutterstockShares of Hershey (NYSE:HSY) have continued to perform strongly. Shares stayed in the green during 2022, as HSY’s underlying business continued to “crush it,” despite challenges such as inflationary pressures. So far in 2023, HSY stock has continued to perform well, even as investors opt for the riskiest stocks rather than the safest stocks. However, if sentiment soon changes again, Hershey may not necessarily join in on the sell-off.  In fact, if the company continues reporting strong earnings growth, as it did in its latest quarterly results, shares could keep climbing higher.Besides appreciation potential, and very low volatility (HSY’s beta, or volatility compared to the overall market is 0.35). This stock also provides investors with a steady, growing dividend (1.71% forward yield). The company has raised its payout by an average of 8.74% annually over the past five years.Lockheed Martin (LMT)An F-16 and an F-35 model at the background, at the Lockheed Martin exhibition stand in Thessaloniki International Fair.Source: Giannis Papanikos / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) isn’t just a defense stock, it’s a defensive stock as well. With the recession-resistant nature of its business, it’s a high quality stock to buy and hold in all markets. While shares initially pulled back at the start of 2023, shares in this low-beta (0.68) stock are bouncing back.Story continuesTo some extent, this LMT stock rebound may be happening on the heels of a recent analyst double-upgrade. On Feb. 6, Credit Suisse’s Scott Deuschle raised his rating on LMT from “underperform” to “outperform,” basing his decision to upgrade on factors such as the defense contractor’s rising book-to-bill ratio, a sign of growth re-acceleration.Shares could potentially move higher in the coming year, in tandem with this expected earnings growth. This safe stock also offers investors steady returns, via its 2.56% dividend. LMT has a 20-year track record of dividend growth.NextEra Energy (NEE)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockIt’s no secret that many of the safest stocks are utilities stocks. Yet among scores of choices, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) may be your best bet. Yes, NEE’s beta (0.44) is on par with most utility stocks in the sector. Shares in this Florida-based electric power company also sell at a valuation premium to other major names in the sector.So then, what exactly makes NEE stock a standout among utilities? That would be its high exposure to the renewable energy megatrend. As InvestorPlace’s Josh Enomoto argued last month, NEE’s clean energy business will keep driving growth, which explains why the stock is a favorite among sell-side analysts.In turn, continued earnings growth likely means continued dividend growth. While offering a lower yield (2.25%) than peers, NEE has raised its payout by an average of 11.6% annually over the past five years.PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockThe consumer staples sector is another area chock full of safe stocks. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is one to consider adding as a safe harbor play. Sure, you may be thinking, why PEP rather than Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock?Yes, PEP stock and KO stock are similar in terms of their main business (soft drink), as well as stock-related metrics like beta (0.57 for PEP, 0.56 for KO) and valuation (mid-20s earnings multiple for both). Still, something else may give PEP the edge in this “cola stock war.”PEP and KO are each dividend kings, and KO does sport a slightly higher yield (2.93%, versus PEP’s 2.68%). However, raising its payout by an average of 7.4% over the past five years, versus an average of 3.53% for Coca-Cola, a higher level of dividend growth may enable PEP to outperform its longstanding rival going forward.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comProcter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a blue chip stock straight out of central casting. A more than century-old business, shares in this household products powerhouse have rewarded investors for generations, with steady dividends and growth.Even today, owning PG stock can provide your portfolio with solid returns. Investors seeking safety should appreciate its super-low beta of 0.4. Although shares may seem pricey, at around 24.5 times earnings, PG is likely to maintain this valuation, as it continues to consistently grow earnings.Current sell-side estimates call for earnings growth of around 8.2% next fiscal year (ending June 2024), and 9% in FY 2025. Add in PG’s 2.58% dividend, which has increased in each of the past 66 years, and it’s clear that Procter &amp; Gamble shares are in a strong position to provide investors with satisfactory returns, with much lower volatility than the overall stock market.Philip Morris (PM)packs of cigarettes in convenience store rackSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.comAmong top tobacco stocks, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) could be the safest in the bunch. Although it trades at a higher valuation, and a slightly higher beta than, say, its former parent company Altria Group (NYSE:MO), the company’s greater level of success so far with going “smoke free” may give its shares an extra degree of safety.As I argued recently, PM’s IQOS heated tobacco product, plus its recent purchase of smokeless tobacco and nicotine products maker Swedish Match, give it far greater exposure to growing segments of the tobacco industry. This could outweigh any possible declines in its legacy cigarette business, if the smoking rate keeps dropping.In addition to greater growth potential, PM stock also offers investors a solid dividend (forward yield of 4.97%). This dividend has grown steadily, increasing by an average of 3.62% annually over the past five years.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)UNH Stock Have Four More YearsSource: ShutterstockSelling off recently, on news of a lower-than-expected increase in Medicare Advantage payments this year, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) may not be acting like a safe stock right now.However, when looking on a longer timeframe, UNH stock remains less volatile than the overall stock market, with a beta of 0.69. This provider of health insurance and related services is not only still a safe stock. UnitedHealth Group remains a high-quality growth stock as well.Analyst forecasts continue to call for UNH to grow its earnings by double-digits over the next two years. Chances are that achieving this will result in a similarly-sized move higher for shares. Along with earnings growth, UNH offers investors the opportunity for dividend growth as well. While its current payout may seem low (1.39%), UnitedHealth has raised its dividend by an average of 17.4% annually over the past five years.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel held MO.

Payments are usually made on a regular basis, quarterly, monthly, or annually, and provide a steady stream of income. So they are a popular choice for investors looking for a more passive way to earn income.And like any other asset, they can be classified by their risk profile. In general, the higher the yield, the greater the risk associated with a given dividend stock. This list favors a more moderate-risk investment style and features many dividend aristocrats. Dividend aristocrats are shares of companies that have increased their dividends for each of the past 25 years. They are among the most reliable ways of building wealth in the stock market, period.TickerCompanyPriceNEENextEra Energy$76.08PMPhilip Morris$102.20CATCaterpillar$249.66ALBAlbemarle$279.34AFLAflac$69.95CVXChevron$174.09LLYEli Lilly$339.68InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBest Dividend Stocks: NextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) stock is an investment in a leading Florida-based energy company. The company spans multiple related business segments. It operates one of the largest electric power companies in the world. That subsidiary, Florida Power &amp; Light Company, focuses on generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity. It also operates one of the largest renewable energy businesses in the world, with a portfolio of wind and solar projects.Investors can expect NextEra Energy to continue to grow its dividend by 10% annually through at least 2024, as outlined in its Jan. 25 Q4 earnings report. Over the last five years, NextEra Energy has grown its dividend at a rate of 11.6%, so investors should not be surprised at the news.NextEra Energy’s utility business, Florida Power &amp; Light, accounted for $4.071 billion of the company’s $6.164 billion in Q4 revenues. Its solar and wind business accounted for $2.093 billion in revenues during the same period. NEE stock represents a potent but reliable mix of growth and stability. Thus, it is among the best dividend stocks to buy.Story continuesPhilip Morris (PM)An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.comInvesting in Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) stock might seem like a losing proposition. The company made its fortune selling cigarettes which continue to see falling demand. It might therefore seem like a case of trying to catch the proverbial falling knife.But there are several reasons to consider Philip Morris, not least of which is its dividend yielding 4.98%. That is a relatively high yield in the world of dividends, but investors can rest assured that it’s quite safe, given that it hasn’t been reduced since 2008.The interesting narrative in favor of PM stock is that the company is leading the shift away from cigarette sales and into smokeless tobacco and smoke-free products. Philip Morris intends to derive 50% of revenues from smoke-free products by 2025. Its competitors, Altria (NYSE:MO) and British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI), currently depend on cigarettes for more than 80% of revenues.The company controls 59% of the global smokeless tobacco market and looks to be leading the way into the next evolutionary iteration of the smoking market. That makes it among the best dividend stocks to buy in my book.Best Dividend Stocks: Caterpillar (CAT)stocks to buySource: ShutterstockCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) stock represents a leading global manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, and industrial gas turbines. The company serves industries including construction, energy, transportation, and mining.There’s really a lot to like about Caterpillar in relation to its dividend. It’s very dependable, having last been reduced in 1992. Its payout ratio of 0.37 lends further credence to the idea that it will continue to be dependable as the ratio is well within the healthy/ideal range. And Caterpillar’s dividend has grown at a rate of 8.6% over the past five years, largely in line with expected stock market growth rates.Caterpillar is also seeing a period of strong demand currently, with sales increasing 20% this quarter YoY. Sales increased by $1.74 billion this quarter, partially due to higher prices. However, sales volumes increased by $1.56 billion, meaning inflation was not the driving factor alone. The strong dollar resulted in a $523 million reduction in sales as sales made in other currencies had to be remunerated in more expensive USD.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) stock is most noted for lithium and bromine production. But the company is involved in the production of a wide range of chemical products that include other catalysts and polymers. Its association with the rapidly growing EV market has garnered lots of attention for the stock, and rightly so: Albemarle is a large-scale producer in a lithium market expected to grow at an annual rate of 12% between 2022 and 2028.In addition to the secular growth trends favoring ALB stock as an investment, it also includes a very reliable dividend with an ultra-low payout ratio. That dividend was last reduced in 1994 and sports a payout ratio of 0.12. That means Albemarle pays about 12% of earnings to investors in the form of dividends, which is very low.ALB stock has roughly $25 of upside above its current price of $289 based on analysts’ consensus prices. However, some believe it could rise as high as $497.Aflac (AFL)the Aflac (AFL) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAflac (NYSE:AFL) sells various insurance products across the U.S. and Japan. The company is probably best known for its supplemental life and health insurance products and is considered a blue-chip stock with stable prices and a reliable dividend that hasn’t been reduced since 1983.Aflac’s reliability serves the company’s stock well, as recent earnings prove. Although the company’s total revenues decreased by 11.8% in 2022 from 2021, share prices are relatively steady. In fact, Aflac’s revenues decreased by 26.2% in Q4 on a YoY basis. However, share prices only declined a few dollars.I’d argue that pieces haven’t dropped much because of Aflac’s blue-chip status but also because EPS estimates are rising for the coming quarters. A few months ago, it was expected that Aflac would provide a Q1 EPS of $1.34. That number now stands at $1.39. The same is true for Q2 EPS estimates which have risen from $1.36 to $1.42, making it among the best dividend stocks.Chevron (CVX)Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) had an excellent 2022 that should pave the way forward for continued strength in its stock. The company’s Jan. 27 earnings report reflected a banner year for the company and the energy sector at large.As one of the largest and highest-profile energy companies known for rewarding investors, Chevron’s earnings are highly important. The company uses those earnings to reward investors through stock buybacks and dividend payouts. So earnings, as opposed to revenues, are particularly relevant. Fortunately, both were exceptionally high throughout 2022 on record prices.Chevron earned $35.47 billion in 2022, far more than the $15.63 it earned in 2021. Chevron paid $11 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends in 2022 and a further $11.25 billion in share purchases. The company reported $37.6 billion in free cash flow in 2022. That free cash flow can be invested in any way the company sees fit. Current speculation suggests that Chevron could soon acquire one of its European rivals because of their lower valuations coupled with Chevron’s strong free cash position.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock remains in a strong position even as sales of its popular drug Mounjaro failed to meet expectations. In terms of dividends, Eli Lilly is rock-solid, having last reduced its dividend in 1986. So, as a reliable passive income source, LLY stock certainly has merits.But most investors are currently interested in Eli Lilly’s shares because of the potential of Mounjaro, its diabetes drug that is also seeking FDA approval for weight loss.Mounjaro was expected to account for $319 million of sales in Q4 but fell short with $279.2 million in sales. That disappointment caused a temporary decline in LLY shares. But shares quickly rebounded. There are a few factors at play here. One, Eli Lilly’s EPS of $2.09 beat the $1.78 expected on Wall Street. But more importantly, Mounjaro is still awaiting FDA approval for marketing as a weight loss drug.The company expects to receive FDA approval for Mounjaro as a weight loss drug next year, and sales are expected to exceed $2 billion in 2023.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

128,2058f1f6-d399-3e2a-a435-2a86079bc595,SHW,2023-02-12,Calculating The Fair Value Of The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-sherwin-williams-130026794.html,1676206826,STORY,['SHW'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.22bUS$2.56bUS$2.85bUS$2.88bUS$3.38bUS$3.60bUS$3.79bUS$3.95bUS$4.09bUS$4.22bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x11Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 6.56%Est @ 5.22%Est @ 4.27%Est @ 3.61%Est @ 3.15% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% US$2.1kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.1%) = US$70bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$70b÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$32bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$53b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$230, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sherwin-Williams as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.041. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Sherwin-WilliamsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Chemicals industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Chemicals market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Major companies like T-Mobile (TMUS), Budweiser (BUD), General Motors (GM), Netflix (NFLX) and Uber (UBER) and set to spend millions of dollars to air a commercial during the broadcast. Betting will also take center stage, with over 50 million people expected to wager billions on sites like DraftKings (DKNG), MGM (MGM) and more.

We will see who the winner is.Story continues[MUSIC PLAYING]DAVID BRIGGS: Hey, everybody. Welcome into our Super Bowl LVII coverage. I'm Dave Briggs, alongside Seana Smith. Cannot wait for this game. We've got a lot coming your way over the next hour. I'm really excited for the game itself, but I want you to go first on what you're eyeing in the game, or outside the game.SEANA SMITH: Well, in the game-- I'm going to say an overall thing-- it's going to be the Eagles, my hometown team. I am very, very excited for them going for their second title in the last six years. Specific, Jalen Hurts, it's all about him. He's got to keep the momentum. I'm excited about that. Aside from the game, the halftime show. Apple is now going-- is the official sponsor of the show this year, taking over from Pepsi. Rihanna is back on the live music stage. I'm excited.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm just out of the loop on Rihanna. I'm sorry. I don't want to offend anybody. I just don't get it. But I know she's awesome. I'm excited because, look, I think the Eagles have a far superior roster. I do acknowledge that. But Andy Reid always has something interesting up his sleeve. Something you have never seen before, and Patrick Mahomes has that Harry-Potter-like wand. He has magic. I think they actually should be a 7 or an 8-point underdog. I think the Eagles are a much better team. But the Chiefs can really surprise you, but I'll be honest, what I'm really looking forward to is my only Super Bowl tradition, my wife's buffalo chicken dip. It's awesome. Like, that's all that matters for me on Super Bowl Sunday.SEANA SMITH: You're going to bring over the leftovers on Monday, then.DAVID BRIGGS: There won't be any, dude.SEANA SMITH: Well, maybe you should--DAVID BRIGGS: I'll be, like, scraping--SEANA SMITH: --leave a little bit--DAVID BRIGGS: --the bowl with my fingers when the chips run out.SEANA SMITH: I got to get the recipe after this show. All right, well, this might be the biggest Super Bowl yet for the gambling industry. Lots to look forward to this weekend. The American Gaming Association releasing its predictions for Super Bowl LVII, estimating that about 50 million Americans will bet roughly $16 billion on this year's game. That's more than double last year's total, but our own, Josh Schafer, has been looking further into this number, what it really means for the sportsbook operators. What do you got for us, Josh?JOSH SHAFER: That's right, Seana. So that's $16 billion number is, obviously, a massive number, but not all of that is going to go right to the sportsbook. So for starters, that number includes both bets placed legally and illegally. It's also an estimate. And if we take a look at last year's estimate, 7.61 billion translated to just $950 million of legal handle. That's according to the AGA's assessment of state data.So less than 15% of last year's estimation ended up as legal handle. Now, the total amount at legal books, and then if you have to think about how these sportsbooks make money, right? So you take that handle-- that legal handle, that $950 million and then you subtract what's known as the gross winning margin, or you multiply it by that gross winning margin, which is only 10% on average.Then when you multiply those, you end up only getting $95 million as the total legal handle-- or, sorry, the gross gaming revenue, which is what goes back to the sportsbooks. That's the number that ends up getting taxed, and that can be taxed, guys, at about an average of a 20% rate. So there are $95 million then taxed at 20%, it's just not quite as big as that $16 billion number we like to talk about all the time, but it is still a huge week, Dave. The stocks have been roaring headed into the Super Bowl. The three or four of the gambling stocks here over the last month, so it certainly is an exciting time.DAVID BRIGGS: You just took like an extra large pizza and boiled it down to one slice.JOSH SHAFER: But that slice could be delicious. That slice could be absolutely delicious.DAVID BRIGGS: And it's still a pretty solid slice. It's a New York-sized slice. But the game is not in New York. It's in Arizona. And that's the first time we've ever had a legal sports gambling state host a Super Bowl. What does that mean? What are the implications?JOSH SHAFER: Well, it means that people can bet well they're sitting in the stadium, right? And that's the biggest thing that we're going to be watching, and really what I want to point out here too is the tax rate. So Arizona taxes mobile betting at a 10% rate, and why I'm watching that number is because Arizona is probably going to have a higher handle this Sunday than they normally would. They're going to get a 10% rate on that. They're going to get a lot of state revenue, guys. And I'm curious how that leads moving forward. As we continue to see gambling grow, are more states going to want the Super Bowl to bring in a lot of gamblers, get people excited for the game and get more state revenue? Seems like a decent deal to me.DAVID BRIGGS: Where's the game next year? Vegas, baby. I mean--JOSH SHAFER: Not a bad place for gambling.DAVID BRIGGS: That seems like it'll work out well. Great stuff. 50. 50 million Americans expected to throw down $16 billion in bets on Super Bowl LVII. Let's dig into those numbers with DraftKings CEO, Jason Robins. Jason, good to see you, man. 33 states now legal. How big is this weekend for you guys compared to anything you've seen in the past? What are your expectations?JASON ROBINS: Oh, I mean, given the growth of the industry, this is almost certainly going to be our biggest Super Bowl ever. And hard to know, it's always-- we always have predictions around the office going in because it's such a fun time. But one thing we know is it's going to be a big day. We know it's going to be our biggest customer acquisition day, and we're all excited to see the results. By the way, I heard in the other set, you're betting on red for the Gatorade? Is that-- I hear that right?DAVID BRIGGS: Do I have the wrong color, bro?JASON ROBINS: Listen, I don't know, but somebody told me, and you should verify this because I did not verify myself that there has never been red Gatorade poured on the winning coach in the Super Bowl. So maybe this is the year, but just a little hot take for you to check out. And I could be totally wrong on that. It was something somebody told me, but you should check that out.DAVID BRIGGS: Betting scoop. I appreciate that, buddy. That is solid. I had my eye on like an Eagles Green, so I'm going to have to look at the odds here on DraftKings.SEANA SMITH: Jeez, I think I picked orange. Hopefully, my odds are a little bit better than what Dave is facing right now, but, Jason, you talk about the popularity of sports betting, certainly we have seen massive growth over the last several years. With the Super Bowl in Arizona, like we're talking about, the first state with statewide legalized sports gambling here, in terms of the number of users that you are expected to add, can you put a number on that?JASON ROBINS: We can. I mean, one, we actually have earnings next week. So I've got to be careful about saying anything like that, but, also, it's just tough to predict. I mean, so much comes in towards the end and the last day, and even in the last hours. And so hard to say, but I know that we think it'll be our biggest day ever, and that's been the case for the last three Superbowls, or last-- excuse me, four Super Bowls since legalized sports betting as well.JOSH SHAFER: Jason, I'm curious what you're seeing out of the live betting space. Obviously, I think it being in Arizona probably helps, right? With people being excited while they're at the game, to probably bet during the game while they're sitting in the stands. I know often we talk about that Europe number, right? Maybe getting to 70, 75% of all bets, or all handle being in that live betting space. Do you think we eventually get there? Or is that where things are headed? How have you sort of seen those trends?JASON ROBINS: You know, live betting continues to increase. I think whether we get there or higher or a little lower, I don't know. But I think it's going to continue to grow. I think more and more people are starting to see that you can make bets during the game. And that doesn't just mean things like what's the next play or something like that.Some people decide, hey, maybe at halftime, they want to double down on the bet they made before the game. Or maybe they want to switch sides or something like that. So lots of options throughout the game.We also, you mentioned Arizona. This is the first year since legalized sports betting outside of Nevada that you will have a Super Bowl in a state with legal sports betting. So really excited to see how that plays out. I agree with you. I think it's going to have a tremendous halo effect on the state.Because not only the people at the game, but all the people that are in Arizona that know that the Super Bowl is here and are paying attention. And we're doing everything we can to let all the people coming in from out of town know, hey, while you're here, you can make a bet. And I think you're going to see a lot of fans take us up on that.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, that is interesting. And next year it'll be the second in a row because it's in Vegas.JASON ROBINS: Yeah.DAVID BRIGGS: But in terms of the big picture, certainly all the momentum is on the side of the sports gambling. But those three big states are out there-- California, Texas, and Florida. What went wrong in California? And when do you see any of those three states turning legal?JASON ROBINS: Well, I mean, California, it's pretty simple. We had over $200 million in opposition spent against us. I think, you know, eight times maybe is close to that, the next biggest opposition spend of any campaign. So, you know, we were literally attacked with a barrage of ads, many of them pushing false narratives. But not much you can do in a short cycle. And people hear what they hear. And, unfortunately, I think some incorrect facts got out there.So, you know, I think, first, we're going to try to work with the tribes. Obviously, that's a much easier path than trying to fight them. And nobody wants that. We actually had in our ballot initiative revenue going to the tribes. We had tethering to the tribes. Everything had to flow through the tribes.And, you know, we're going to hopefully get another year, another, I guess, two years from now. Well, one year from now, we're going to be able to potentially take another shot. And I think we have to learn from last time and educate a little better and be smarter about it. So we'll see on that.One Texas is in play this year. I think there's a live bill that has a decent shot of advancing. We'll have to see. Obviously, a lot to play out in the legislative session. So, you know, I think those are the two biggest states.Florida, you mentioned also, you know, tribal state, so has some of the same dynamics. But in that case, it's really one tribe, the Seminoles. So, you know, trying to figure out a way to collaborate with them, I think.And, hopefully, that's where the industry is going. There's just more collaboration. And everybody realizes that a rising tide will lift all ships. And, you know, I think that's something that we're seeing slowly but surely to try and move towards. But still a lot of work to do there, and especially in those big states. They're big prizes. So there's obviously going to be a lot of interest and a lot of stakeholders.SEANA SMITH: All right, Jason Robins, CEO of DraftKings, always great to have you. Thanks so much. Have fun this weekend.JASON ROBINS: OK, thank you so much.SEANA SMITH: All right, well, Arizona, like we've been talking about, is hosting this year's Super Bowl. Hundreds of thousands of fans are already there, getting ready for the big game. Yahoo Finance contributor Kevin Cirilli is doing just that. And Kevin, I know you spoke with a lot of key voices down there. I've got to say, I'm very jealous. I wish I was in your shoes right now. Give us a lay of the land. What's it like down there in Arizona right now?KEVIN CIRILLI: Well, when the plane landed at Sky Harbor, I thought I was in Ireland. Because all I kept seeing was green. There are literally-- I mean, there's-- I've seen like maybe one or two Chiefs fans. But, I mean, it's all Eagles fans everywhere. So, I mean, I feel like I'm at home here in sunny Scottsdale. Camelback Mountain behind me, if you know the area.Look, I was at the Phoenix Open, the Waste Management Open earlier this week, which has really become a business private partnership, a public private partnership, really a hub that Jack Selby, who's the managing director for Peter Thiel's family, and he's got his own venture capitalist investing $110 million here in the state. He started this thing. And it's really gone global.And one of the folks he was able to get out there was governor Katie Hobbs, the newly-elected Democratic governor of Arizona. And she noted the economic impact that the Super Bowl, that the Phoenix Open that that's having on this state. Take a listen to what she told me on the 17th hole.KATIE HOBBS: It is huge. It is huge. We have 160,000 workers in our tourism and hospitality industry that are ready to welcome the visitors that are already here, making sure they have a great experience. That gets return visits. And that helps our economy. The last time we had the Super Bowl in 2015, the economic impact was over $700 million.- $700 million?KATIE HOBBS: Yeah, yeah With over 100,000 visitors. So we're expecting to top that. And the lasting benefits for our economy, because we've become sort of-- we have a great track record with these kind of big events. And it's just going to attract more of them in the future.KEVIN CIRILLI: So when you look at the numbers, last year alone, $24.2 billion worth in the sports and tourism industry contributed to Arizona's GDP. They're expecting that the Super Bowl alone will increase that number to more than $1,000,000,000. So you could see a five percentage increase in that regard.But a lot of economic development here outside of sports. The semiconductor chip manufacturing that's being conducted here in the state, something that President Biden talked about in his State of the Union address earlier this week. Remember, Intel, TSMC building their fab factories down here.The governor is excited about that. Jack Selby is excited about that. A lot happening. They're trying to give Austin a run for their money.DAVID BRIGGS: All right, quickly, I know you're a big fan. I know you think Philly is going to win. Give me a score. And what's the particular edge you think that Philly has over KC?KEVIN CIRILLI: All right, well, one, the fans. That's the edge, clearly. Two, they're going to essentially be playing in a home stadium. And, three, I'm thinking it'll be 27-24, Birds. I do think it's going to be a nail-biter. I heard you compare-- I heard you compare the Chiefs to Hogwarts. And I got to say, that is not the case, OK? Like the Eagles are Gryffindor, let me just put it that way. How's that?DAVID BRIGGS: First off, it was Patrick Mahomes is Harry Potter, has a bit of wizardry to him. Let's get it straight, Cirilli, all right?KEVIN CIRILLI: OK.DAVID BRIGGS: Good luck, brother. Enjoy it out there, OK?KEVIN CIRILLI: I appreciate it. That's awesome, awesome. I'll talk to you guys later. Thank you for having me.DAVID BRIGGS: All right, we're going to be taking a look now at some prop bets through the hour. Our Josh Schafer, he is our resident junky gambler. And he's going to break it down for us. I need some prop action. So what do you got?JOSH SCHAFER: We've got some fun ones here for you guys. We're going to start with Gatorade, which sounds like it's a hot topic for you two. And--DAVID BRIGGS: Yep.SEANA SMITH: Yes.JOSH SCHAFER: --I'm not going to lie, where did we pick? Who had red? Someone had red, right?DAVID BRIGGS: I took red.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, all right, you're with 8% of the handle here. That's plus 450 odds, Dave. So what you're looking at is where people are betting. So the most bet on Gatorade is yellow. 40% of the money is on yellow. And then you've got 20% of the money on blue, 20% of the money on orange.SEANA SMITH: That's my pick.JOSH SCHAFER: My pick-- I've got to step out of the way here-- is purple. Because I think Riptide Rush is the best Gatorade. And that's simply all I'm picking off of. There is some fun stats, if you guys want to go deep into this, right? Orange is the most picked. That's probably why Seana picked it. It's come up the most times since 2001.SEANA SMITH: I did my research.JOSH SCHAFER: And then yellow is also very popular right now among Eagles fans. So yellow was poured on Doug Pederson at the NFC Championship and the Super Bowl the last time the Eagles won. And Nick Sirianni two weeks ago had yellow Gatorade poured on him.DAVID BRIGGS: Oh.SEANA SMITH: I love that flavor.JOSH SCHAFER: We like yellow.DAVID BRIGGS: That's a solid scoop. There are some of these colors, Josh, that are a little bit in between, that there's like a greenish-blue. You know what I mean, that greenish-blue Gatorade.JOSH SCHAFER: Green-blue, well, we've got yellow-green.DAVID BRIGGS: Right, I'm looking at it--JOSH SCHAFER: We're going to have to call back up Jason Robins--SEANA SMITH: You're the one that's disputing the color of Gatorade.JOSH SCHAFER: --and dispute what color you had. Because yellow-green is the only unclear one here. Then you've got red-pink.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, that would be pretty clear.DAVID BRIGGS: But like, pink?SEANA SMITH: That's going to be a tough one to argue with.DAVID BRIGGS: Is that even a Gatorade?JOSH SCHAFER: That's why I'm going with purple. It's simple.DAVID BRIGGS: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: I don't know if it's ever happened.SEANA SMITH: I'm going orange.JOSH SCHAFER: But I'm going purple.DAVID BRIGGS: OK, all right, that's a good job.JOSH SCHAFER: All right, coming up, Eagles defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh who competes for his second Super Bowl ring on Sunday also boasts an impressive investing portfolio. He'll tell us more about it next.[MUSIC PLAYING]No shortage of storylines ahead of Super Bowl LVII. We've got the first ever meeting of Black quarterbacks, the first ever meeting between two brothers in Jason and Travis Kelce, and the third Super Bowl with three different teams from one of the greatest defensive linemen in NFL history. I'm talking about Eagles five time all-pro defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, who joins us now.Great of you to find the time during this busy week, my friend. So three teams, three Super Bowls. What makes this experience different for you?NDAMUKONG SUH: The experience each and every single year is different. No matter what team you're with, whether you've been with the team for 10 years or two years, every year is different. Every team is different and always going to continue to be that way, unfortunately. But that's part of the business. But it's exciting to have an opportunity to get back to the Super Bowl and have another opportunity to win.SEANA SMITH: Ndamukong, it's great to see. You're playing for my hometown team. So I am clearly rooting for you on Sunday. You're playing this time for Nick Sirianni. Who's not that much older than you. From your time with the Eagles this year, what have you learned from him just in terms of the leadership and his success that he's clearly having so early in his career?NDAMUKONG SUH: He's a great coach. Having played against him last year in the playoffs when I was down in Tampa and we took care of business that first round, but he's a great coach. He understands all the different nuances, has an opportunity to be a leader on the offensive side of the ball, but also understand the defense and how we want to particularly rush up front and get off the quarterbacks. And I think from the standpoint of his leadership, he just understands, it's all about keeping detail-oriented process, focusing on the things that count the most when it comes to situational ball and going from there.DAVID BRIGGS: I mentioned that quarterback match-up, which is so intriguing. Tell me about the key to defending, to stopping, to containing Patrick Mahomes. And if I could ask a double, you shut down your quarterback, Jalen Hurts, this time last year a bit earlier. How much has he grown in that one year?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, we'll start first with Patrick Mahomes. He's a great talent, very, very elusive, to say the least. I've been going against him in years past, but most notably in the 2021 Super Bowl that I won with Tampa. He's just always extending the play. And that's something that as a defensive line that we have to focus on.There's no end in rushing. Until that ball either incomplete or you got a sack and he's fully, fully down, you've got to keep rushing. Because he loves to extend plays and make things happen and getting balls to the receivers, especially 87.And so when it comes to transitioning to Jalen, I think Jalen has grown tremendously. He's found a way to not only hurt people with his feet, but as well as his arm. And I think the GM Howard did an amazing job defining great talent around him and adding some pieces, for example, AJ Brown.DAVID BRIGGS: Boy, has he come a long way in just one year. Speaking of, you've come a long way over your career. You were once voted the dirtiest player in the league. You've been fined more than $600,000. But, recently, you played peacekeeper against the Niners. How do you think you have evolved over these 13 years? Or were you just misunderstood?NDAMUKONG SUH: I've always said it, if people ever take the time to really get to understand me and get to know me and really truthfully be unbiased when it comes to my personality and my character, they wouldn't have made those votes and they wouldn't have had that particular characteristics around me as a person. I've always been some sort of a peacekeeper or, if you want to call it that. But I know Trent well. So when he saw me getting in front of him and it wasn't about anything other than the game is pretty much over, let's move on, let's get to the next play and go from there.SEANA SMITH: You've clearly had a lot of success on the field. You've also had a lot of success off the field as well. I know you have invested in over 30 companies. One of your mentors is actually Warren Buffett. Talk to us just about that relationship, the biggest lessons that you've learned from him, and how that's really helped shape your investment career.NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think the biggest thing that I've learned from Mr. Buffett is just being able to have good people around you. And as you see, he has multiple companies. He trusts those folks and puts them in places and empowers them.And that's something that I like to do, not only in my foundation with my family and my wife, but also being to be able to empower people, whether it's in the real estate realm, having a development company, being able to build multifamily housing, being able to take care of other people and finding ways to find affordable housing for folks that should be afforded to them at all times. And it's tough in this day and age, especially going through the pandemic. You saw that it's probably its worst. And so hopefully we can continue as a collective to get better in that space. But when it comes to investing, I just have fun with it.I love learning. I love being able to sit down with folks. I actually sat down with one of our owners yesterday to have a great conversation of how he built his company with KKR. I've done some work with them. And so it's a fun opportunity for me to just be able to build relationships and learn from folks and then being able to be involved and be hands-on.SEANA SMITH: You mentioned your involvement in real estate there a moment ago, some of your initiatives, how you're looking to tackle housing affordability. From your perspective from your involvement in the space over the last several years, what more do you think needs to be done? And how do we better address this issue?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think it's-- I think one of the key things that we could do, especially when it comes to affordable housing, is kind of take it out of the city and state's hands. If we privatize it in a manner and incentivize private real estate people, it'd be great. Because if you really look at it and break down the numbers from a perspective how I look at it, it's one of the most expensive housing just because of the rules and regulations that go into it, which I understand and respect. But if we potentially looked at it being privatized, I think would be a lot faster and to be able to be something that is afforded to people a lot quicker.SEANA SMITH: You're involved in over 30 companies here. I think a lot of people at home are asking, how do you have the time for this? How involved are you with each investment?NDAMUKONG SUH: Yeah, I think I'm very, very involved in every single day, finding time to be able to do it. But it's really being able to compartmentalize things. Obviously, playing football pulls me away from it a fair amount. But I've been at it for 13 years. I understand how I need to study, how I need to focus, even going into a very important week like this week with the Super Bowl, I can still look at things. I probably won't as detailed and push it off just a week or two.But, for me, I still look at opportunities and find time to do it. And I think one of the greatest things that helps you keep you sharp. Because if you get overloaded in one particular thing, then you don't have the capacity to go and look at other things and find ways to keep your mind sharp when it comes to, one, playing football and knowing what you need to accomplish.DAVID BRIGGS: That is a super sharp man and a likely future Hall of Famer Ndamukong Suh. Well, if you don't have a ticket to the Super Bowl, you're not too late. And the trends are, in fact, going in your favor. So maybe be patient. You will, though, have to shell out a ton of cash to go to this game.We're taking a look at the prices all through this week. The cheapest tickets selling for $4,300. That was Monday, according to StubHub. But that number gradually declining through the week, the opposite trend that we usually see-- dropping $200 Tuesday, a huge drop of $500 on Wednesday. And we're finishing out the week with the cheapest ticket costing $3,100. Still a ton of cheddar, but it's come down considerably from the beginning of the week.All that data is for the cheapest ticket to the game. That's in the nosebleeds. If you want the good seats, if you want to bring a friend that you're trying to impress, you've got to really shell out. And here's the cost.You can sit in section 138M, row 44, main end zone. Tickets are a cool $87,000 each. So you and a friend will pay over $174,000 to see the game. You better-- well, we won't go on.Some other trends we're watching, Eagles fans are outselling Chiefs fans by more than double, according to StubHub. That fits what we're hearing from Kevin Cirilli on the ground in Arizona. The ticket vendor seeing a last-minute sales spike in Mexico, the top, number two top selling country outside of the US, behind Canada. And most US buyers are coming from these five states-- no surprise, Pennsylvania, California, New Jersey, Arizona, and Florida. Chiefs fans in Missouri and Kansas accounting for a combined 8% of sales. What's going on, Chiefs fans? You've got a couple of days to try to change that dynamic.Coming up, Apple will be in the spotlight at Super Bowl LVII. Find out what a big Sunday could mean for that company. And we asked you if Rihanna will bring out any surprise guests during the Apple-sponsored Super Bowl halftime show. Roughly 60% of you said ""yes."" We will discuss coming up who that might be. Some of you made predictions. We've got A$AP Rocky, Miley Cyrus, JAY-Z, even Beyoncé as a possible guest. More on what else to expect coming up next.[MUSIC PLAYING]SEANA SMITH: A huge part of the Super Bowl is the halftime show, with many people tuning into the game just for that big performance. This year, Apple is the official sponsor and Rihanna is taking the stage with her first live performance in years. I know I'm very excited for the game. Allie Canal is very excited for the game. She's on the set. Now you don't have to look any further than that jersey that she's wearing for who she's rooting for this weekend.ALLIE CANAL: Go Birds. Go Birds.DAVID BRIGGS: She's chair dancing, man.SEANA SMITH: She's chair dancing.ALLIE CANAL: I'm, like, in such a great mood. I'm so excited.SEANA SMITH: There we go. We're ready.ALLIE CANAL: Right.JOSH SCHAFER: You might have to hide on Monday. I don't know.SEANA SMITH: Lots of hype here. All right, Al, let's talk about the halftime show, right? Because lots of money going into it, lots of hype ahead of this show. What can we expect? And how expensive is it for these musicians?ALLIE CANAL: Well, the NFL, you know, famously doesn't pay the halftime performers. But it does pay for all the upfront costs. So think about the stages, the background dancers, the lighting. That's all the NFL. And that could amount to a pretty hefty price tag, around $17 million.That was a reported cost for last year's show. You know RiRi. She's going to want the production value. It could be even more for that. And for Rihanna, she was asked to do the halftime show back in 2019. She said no in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick.Now she's back. She said she's ready for this moment. She's apparently changed her setlist 39 times. So I am ready for this. And it's going to be very big for her in terms of her streams on those music platforms like Spotify, like Apple Music.If you take a look at the past, last year's performance, which featured Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem, and 50 Cent, each and every one of those performers saw a boost to their personal catalogs. Dr. Dre saw 183% increase in album sales, a 105% bump in on-demand streams. Mary J. Blige, her album sales jumped almost 1,000%, with Snoop Dogg's rising 361%.And then if you take a look at the five years prior, we have The Weeknd, J.Lo, Shakira, Maroon 5, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, all an uptick in digital downloads, album sales, Spotify streams. So the exposure here is unbelievable. And that's really why it's worth it for a lot of these artists. And we've seen an uptick in the amount of viewers that are actually tuning in and watching this halftime show. Last year, for example, viewership was up 7% compared to 2021 with more than 130 million people tuning in. So we'll have to see if Rihanna can get those numbers up even higher, which I think she can.DAVID BRIGGS: Do you really?ALLIE CANAL: I do. People are excited about this.DAVID BRIGGS: I know, I know. I'm excited. Don't get me wrong. A lot of people want to know, opening song and special guest. We've seen a lot of that in recent years. What do you got?ALLIE CANAL: Opening song, I've got ""Run This Town."" That just feels to me like an opening song. Special guest, I think it has to be JAY-Z. JAY-Z's Roc Nation is a producer of the halftime show. Rihanna is also signed to the Roc Nation label. So I feel like he's going to help out his girl. He's featured on a lot of her songs. So that's my prediction. That's where I'm going with it.DAVID BRIGGS: We're going to go around the horn real quick. I'm going to go totally outside the box. I think she is unconventional. I don't think she's going to do anybody predictable. It's going to be a country star. It's going to be like Zach Bryan--SEANA SMITH: That would be a curveball.DAVID BRIGGS: --or Zac Brown Band.JOSH SHAFER: Chris Stapleton stays after the National Anthem?DAVID BRIGGS: Oh, that'd be amazing, my favorite singer of all time. But I think someone-- Sugarland, someone like that. Unconventional, brings in a different portion of the audience.SEANA SMITH: I've got to agree with Allie. I was going to go JAY-Z before we even heard her pick. I think that makes the most sense. We know he has shown a little bit of resistance against the Super Bowl halftime show in the past. I would not be surprised if we see him on that stage on Sunday.JOSH SCHAFER: They always make fun of on the sports shows when everyone picks the same team, right, and we all have the same little icon on the bottom. Because I'm going to pick JAY-Z too.SEANA SMITH: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: So that's when they normally say that's not going to happen. But I don't know. It's my favorite song. ""Run This Town"" is my favorite song. JAY-Z is, obviously, very involved, as Allie said. So that was my pick before everyone else picked. So we've got to stay with it.SEANA SMITH: All right, I like ""Umbrella.""DAVID BRIGGS: Wow.ALLIE CANAL: She's predicting ""Umbrella.""SEANA SMITH: ""Ella-ella-ella.""ALLIE CANAL: ""Umbrella"" as a finale-- I could see a bunch of umbrellas out there.SEANA SMITH: Yes, exactly. It could be a good one. We'll see.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, I like that.SEANA SMITH: Clearly, we are very excited for the halftime show. David, you've got to jump on board here, you know?DAVID BRIGGS: I am, man.SEANA SMITH: We're going to get you to become a Rihanna fan.ALLIE CANAL: He's such a boomer. Dave is a boomer.SEANA SMITH: Sooner rather than later.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm gonna be honest, that's when I get my Buffalo chicken dip, man, whatever.SEANA SMITH: All right.DAVID BRIGGS: I'm here for the game.ALLIE CANAL: OK, boomer.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, thanks so much. Well, Apple, like we've been talking about, replacing Pepsi as the official sponsor for this year's Super Bowl halftime show. $250 million deal spans five years. This is according to the ""Sports Business Journal."" Let's discuss what this means for the tech giant.For that, we want to bring back Dan Ives, Wedbush managing director, its senior equity analyst. Dan, it's great to see you here. So, clearly, a huge move for Apple, now being the sponsor of the halftime show. How big of a win do you think it is for the company?Dan, I think you're muted. And we love the Eagles jersey, by the way. Got it?DAN IVES: OK, so part of what Cook and Cupertino are focused on is really on the NFL and live sports. And this is an important part of, ultimately, what we see Apple doing more and more of over the coming years. I think it's a huge win. And especially in this macro period, Apple doing this further flexes the muscles.SEANA SMITH: Dan, when you talked about Apple here going forward, I think lots of questions just about the amount of money that they have spent or are going to spend on the halftime shows over the next several years. When you see that, does that make sense for them, given the fact that there's no guaranteed return on this type of investment?DAN IVES: But Apple, they're tacticians in terms of how they spend. And this is something they don't just do quickly. And if you look at the history, I mean, they have basically made big bets that have been home successes. And I also I think at this juncture, it's very important that they're investing at a time where some others maybe be are pulling back. And I think that's an important time, especially going into more iPhone launches as well as some other technologies I'd expect them to introduce over the coming months.DAVID BRIGGS: You thought they were going to take a big swing at the Sunday NFL Ticket package. What happened there? Did they end up making a bid? Did it just get out of the range they wanted to spend? And do you think they'll take another pass at an NBA, NFL type of property?DAN IVES: Yeah, and, look, I think there was significant involvement. I think some reports have talked about it. I just think it got to a point where they're only going to spend a certain amount. Ultimately, they were not going to go to that level.But live sports is the key to streaming. I mean, that is one of the keys for Apple when it comes to the streaming piece. I don't think they're stopping here. I think they're going to go after major sports over the coming years. When you look at that content strategy, I mean, it just further highlights whether it's streaming in terms of on TV or what we see with Apple Music, services, under the radar, has actually morphed into a pretty massive business.DAVID BRIGGS: How much will live sports mean for this tech battle? We just discussed Apple. You've got Google who made the big play for Sunday NFL Ticket, $2 and 1/2 billion a year, rumored to be per year, and then Amazon, of course, already in with Thursday Night Football. Or is it not that important in terms of the overall growth investor story?DAN IVES: I think it's a golden jewel, I mean, in terms of what big tech is focused on with streaming. Live sports is what is ultimately-- and that's why the value continues to go up. Because that's just traditional media. I think big tech is going to take significant bets on live sports over the coming year, especially as you look into '23, '24, '25, '26, a lot sort of come up for renewal. And I think streaming is going to be a big part of that over the coming years.SEANA SMITH: Dan, we don't have to ask you who you're rooting for, very clear. Got to ask you about the score. What do you think it's going to be on Sunday?DAN IVES: I see Eagles by 10.SEANA SMITH: OK.DAN IVES: I think, ultimately, yeah, I think between Hurts and that defense, I see a lot of happy fans in the 215 area code.SEANA SMITH: I hope you are right. 215 area code is my hometown. Dan Ives, great to see you. Thanks so much.DAN IVES: Thank you.SEANA SMITH: All right, Josh has another bet that he's watching over there. What do you got now, Josh?JOSH SCHAFER: All right, guys, we've got the coin toss now. You can bet on a 50/50 coin toss. I know, how exciting, right? But people will do it.And we asked our viewers what they picked. And they like heads. We had 55% or just about 55% of people say that they would vote heads or bet heads. But then when you look actually at where the money is right now at a place like Caesars Sportsbook, the money's on tails.58% of people betting on tails. You can see the odds right there, -102 and -102. Of course, even odds because, again, it's a 50/50 bet. Now, if you want to go fun stats, four out of the last five Super Bowls were heads.DAVID BRIGGS: That is nice research.SEANA SMITH: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: So I don't know if that makes you think your tails is due or--SEANA SMITH: What would you bet, Josh?JOSH SCHAFER: I would go heads.SEANA SMITH: You would go heads?JOSH SCHAFER: Yes, in a former life, I did the coin toss all the time. I always went heads. You've got to play the same one every time. I think you have to do a strategy on a 50/50.SEANA SMITH: Stick with it.DAVID BRIGGS: Real quickly, I want your pick with the spread. It's Philly by 1 and 1/2. Who do you got?JOSH SCHAFER: Dave, I have a lot of bets set up. Why don't we talk about that in about 10 minutes?DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, all right. Nice tease.JOSH SCHAFER: Coming up next, the Super Bowl ad landscape is getting a makeover. Find out why sports betting platforms like FanDuel could be a winning bet on Sunday.[MUSIC PLAYING]- It's called the kick of destiny.- What the heck is kick of destiny?- Good luck. See you in Phoenix. Don't miss.- Oh, boy.DAVID BRIGGS: Oh, it's going to be live, 45 yard field goal for Gronk FanDuel's Kick of Destiny campaign starring Rob Gronkowski, getting plenty of buzz ahead of the big game. Who else is getting bang for their 7 million bucks? John Connors is the co-founder and CEO of marketing and communications agency Boathouse. He joins us now. John, good to see you, man.So last year was labeled the Crypto Bowl. How significant a presence is gambling making? Did they replace crypto?JOHN CONNORS: Yeah, I think to your point, this year is going to be the-- you know, the booze, chips, and gambling bowl all combined. And I love the fact that you led with Gronk.SEANA SMITH: Well, speaking of it being the booze, chips, and gambling bowl, let's talk about the gambling aspect of it with the booze. Because Molson Coors is back in the Super Bowl after more than 30 years. They're teaming up with DraftKings. And what's interesting about this initiative is that they're allowing users to bet on who they think, for example, what beer is going to appear first, what dog is going to be used in the commercial. From your perspective, just the engagement aspect of this, how smart is that? And what do you think we'll hear from other alcohol brands this Sunday?JOHN CONNORS: Yeah, I mean, I think, to your point, you can't separate gambling from the Super Bowl, right? And so the ability to make that brand connection and to get that engagement, these days, everyone's trying to figure out how they can drive up that engagement value, how they can drive up that social value, how they can drive up the conversation. And so I think FanDuel and DraftKings have done masterful jobs, sort of between the Gronk bet and the betting on Coors Miller and all the other pieces of driving up as much conversation as possible.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, the live element of the FanDuel ad, have we ever seen anything like that? And how big do you think that will pay off?JOHN CONNORS: I think we've seen things like that, but not in the Super Bowl, right? So I think at this level, I mean, I think you've seen a lot of categories try and launch a lot of new ideas all the way back to Apple in 1984. It's always a massive platform for new launches. And I think as those two exchange blows to sort of capture attention, capture volume, I think it's a masterful play.SEANA SMITH: Well, John, for the big ads, they're pricing out just around $7 million for 30 seconds. We're seeing many companies team up. Like we've been talking about one GM and Netflix in this ad starring Will Ferrell.WILL FERRELL: General Motors is going electric. And Netflix is joining by including more EVs in their movies and shows. The least they can do. So, if you're going to get swarmed by an army of the dead, why not get swarmed in an EV? Ew. I said no biting.- Oh.WILL FERRELL: Or if you're being voluntarily kidnapped, why not be kidnapped in an EV? What's that scent? Is it pine?SEANA SMITH: So GM teaming up with Netflix, trying to push their EVs to make them more mainstream. What do you think of this strategy, a big streamer teaming up with an automaker?JOHN CONNORS: I think you're seeing-- well, last year's automakers were an interesting strategy. It was majority of electric vehicles when none of them had the electric vehicles yet. So they were all teasing sort of what was coming down the road. I think you're seeing that collaboration piece across the Super Bowl this year. I think, you know, the marketers like to follow the artists. And the artists have been doing collabs for a long time.And I think we're just seeing a significant number. As you know as well, there's a little more safety in a collaboration. Sort of two teams, two big brands like Netflix and GM going at it together just drives it a little bit more safety for that chief marketing officer.SEANA SMITH: All right, John Connors, thanks so much for joining us. I know a lot of us are very excited for all the ads that we will be seeing in just two days from now.JOHN CONNORS: Go Eagles.SEANA SMITH: Well, coming up, the Super Bowl Indicator. We'll tell you how stocks may perform next week based on the big game's outcome. Stay with us.[MUSIC PLAYING]JOSH SCHAFER: Welcome back to our Super Bowl special here on Yahoo Finance. Normally, we talk plenty about market indicators on this show, like a 100-day moving average or how stocks perform in election years. But some say even sports can tell us where Mr. Market is headed over the next year. Ryan Detrick over at Carson Research recently released the latest data for what's known as the Super Bowl Indicator, which tells us how markets perform depending on the outcome of the big game.So let's keep it simple to start. Markets have historically performed better after a team from the NFC conference wins than if the AFC wins. You can see here that's 10% for the NFC, an average return 6.9% for the AFC. So, really, people should be rooting for this indicator for the Eagles, who are in the NFC. That would give us a better return per the data.Now that was a historical chart, of course, going all the way back and counting all outcomes. But both these teams have also won Super Bowls in the past. So the Eagles have won one Super Bowl just a couple of years ago. And the S&amp;P 500 fell 6.2% that year.The Chiefs have won two Super Bowls. When you average those together, that's up 8.1%. So not a lot to take there, only three games. I don't think that's my favorite one. Let's get to my favorite one.Market bulls should really be rooting for a blowout on Sunday. So if you take a look here, the average return of the S&amp;P 500 is 8.5%. Now, when there's a single-digit win in the Super Bowl, it goes up 4.9% on average. When there's a double-digit win in the Super Bowl, it goes up 10.9% on average. But when there's a blowout and someone wins by 21 points or more, there's a blowout in the markets too. And the S&amp;P 500 rises on average 13.6% that year.So I don't know about you guys, I might root for an Eagles blowout on Sunday.SEANA SMITH: Heck yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Maybe my 401(k) can recover from last year a little bit.DAVID BRIGGS: Philly fan here is going to root for that. That will not happen. They could have a comfortable win, but not a blowout win.JOSH SCHAFER: Well, keep that thought.DAVID BRIGGS: Where is the public money at?JOSH SCHAFER: The public money? Let's take a look at the public money, Dave. So we know the spread is 1 and 1/2, right, coming into this game. So the Eagles are favored by 1 and 1/2. And the public money right now is on the Eagles.So 69% of the handle on DraftKings Sportsbook is currently on the Eagles to cover that 1 and 1/2 point spread. So that means they'd have to win by 2. And then where I really want to bet on Sunday, I think, because I love the totals, is 51. So 51 is the total. And that's where people are betting right now.Here's my favorite bet, though. Travis Kelce, first touchdown. I bet it earlier in the playoffs. It hit. I love the first touchdown bets. It's really exciting to watch the first couple drives and see it. Plus 700, I'm all over it, Dave.Seana, what are you watching on Sunday? Give us a bet. You've got to give us a pick.SEANA SMITH: All right, well, I went in with a parlay. And I stole this from Ross Tucker, full disclosure. But I've got to give credit where credit's due. And I liked it. I liked it a lot.So let's talk about it. I think Jalen Hurts is going to score a touchdown. I think Haason Reddick is also going to get a sack. And I also think that the Eagles are going to win. And I'm confident in it.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, Tucker's a pretty good gambler. He's no dummy. I've got a dumb bet. Because these are dumb bets when you have multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple things that have to happen. Patrick Mahomes over 1 and 1/2 touchdowns, Travis Kelce over 50 yards, AJ Brown over 50 yards, DeVonta Smith-- receiver for the Eagles-- under 63 and 1/2 yards, and Jalen Hurts over 40 yards rushing. Full disclosure, I also stole mine from a 15-year-old who lives in my house. But he's pretty good at this.JOSH SCHAFER: It seems like we bet a lot on the ankle injuries there and the lower extremities. How healthy is Jalen Hurts? How healthy is Patrick Mahomes? To talk football a little bit, I'm nervous about some of those prop bets. I've heard some--DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, you don't like it? You don't like it?JOSH SCHAFER: I don't know.DAVID BRIGGS: Well, look, the thing-- now, I say a dumb bet because those have such tremendous odds that they lure in a lot of people because they pay off well. But no one ever wins them.JOSH SCHAFER: They have the highest hold rate for sportsbooks. Sportsbooks want you to bet those same game parlays because they make the most money off of them. But coming up, we're talking about inflation. It's crashing your Super Bowl party. Find out how much you'll need to shell out for food and drinks when we come back.[MUSIC PLAYING]SEANA SMITH: What good is watching football if you don't have a bevy of snacks and also drinks to enjoy during the big game? But this year, you've got to keep a very close eye on that price tag. Because when it comes to checkout, some fan favorites are much pricier than they've been in years past. Allie Canal joining us now with a closer look at what we will be paying this weekend. Allie, what do you got?ALLIE CANAL: Wow, the good news is, Seana, if you want some chicken wings-- which we have on our set now-- that's actually cheaper, 22% cheaper compared to this time last year, $2.65 versus $3.38 per pound the week of Super Bowl 2022. And that's due to a larger supply of wings, decreased freight costs, all of that driving prices lower. And if you want to get a little bit fancier than wings, we have sirloin steak prices. That's also down by about $1 per pound. I feel like you really are a steak guy, Philly cheesesteak maybe?DAVID BRIGGS: Not during the Super Bowl.SEANA SMITH: Philly cheesesteak--ALLIE CANAL: Philly cheesesteak, though-- I think that could be an option.JOSH SCHAFER: You can't have a steak during the Super Bowl.ALLIE CANAL: I know, so you probably want to stick with the wings. Plus, 22% versus, you know, versus the $1 less, I think you go with the wings here. But chips and guac, avocados, they're also down, which is nice. But something that's up is your beer, 11% higher.SEANA SMITH: Wow.DAVID BRIGGS: And they've seen demand slip because of that towards the end of the year, yeah.ALLIE CANAL: And I think it's interesting too that soft drinks as well, they're up 25% So it's actually cheaper to get a little buzz going than just stay sober during the game. But we were talking about--SEANA SMITH: You need another reason to go out and get a drink during the big game.JOSH SHAFER: In the spirit of that--ALLIE CANAL: In the spirit of that, but talking about spirits, though, that's actually only up 2% while wine is up 3%. So maybe a little sangria action if you don't want the beer. That's a cheaper option.DAVID BRIGGS: Not bad.ALLIE CANAL: But, overall, I think for the Super Bowl people, people want to drink their beer.DAVID BRIGGS: Wings versus boneless wings, Allie. You are the expert. We have them both here. Seana and I are team boneless.SEANA SMITH: We are.ALLIE CANAL: I'm not Team Boneless. I am--SEANA SMITH: We're on a little island by ourselves.ALLIE CANAL: I'm bone-in, but I'm flats over drumsticks all day.SEANA SMITH: Oh, yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah.SEANA SMITH: What about you?JOSH SCHAFER: No, I'm absolutely bone-in. I am of the take that if you have boneless wings, they're actually just--ALLIE CANAL: That just looks sad.JOSH SCHAFER: --those are chicken nuggets. Those are chicken nuggets. Those are chicken nuggets.DAVID BRIGGS: Josh, Seana, Allie--SEANA SMITH: I will eat them all to myself.DAVID BRIGGS: --thank you, guys. That'll do it for our big game coverage. Enjoy the weekend. Enjoy the Super Bowl. And we'll see you on Monday.ALLIE CANAL: Go Birds.]"

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Cisco Systems' (NASDAQ:CSCO) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Cisco Systems, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$14b ÷ (US$93b - US$25b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).Therefore, Cisco Systems has an ROCE of 21%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Communications industry average of 9.3%. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Cisco Systems compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Cisco Systems' ROCE Trending?You'd find it hard not to be impressed with the ROCE trend at Cisco Systems. The figures show that over the last five years, returns on capital have grown by 68%. That's a very favorable trend because this means that the company is earning more per dollar of capital that's being employed. Interestingly, the business may be becoming more efficient because it's applying 33% less capital than it was five years ago. If this trend continues, the business might be getting more efficient but it's shrinking in terms of total assets.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Cisco Systems' ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that Cisco Systems has been able to turn things around and earn higher returns on lower amounts of capital. Considering the stock has delivered 24% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.Before jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

However, with so many variables ahead of the markets, a dull but dependable route may be more prudent.For this list of dividend stocks to buy, every company features a payout ratio – or the proportion of earnings a company pays its shareholders via dividends – below 70%. As well, each enterprise carries a consensus rating among analysts of moderate buy or its equivalent. That way, prospective investors can also enjoy capital gains potential.TXNTexas Instruments$176.50UPSUnited Parcel Service$186.36DOXAmdocs$95.21TSCOTractor Supply$231.24SNASnap-on$251.20JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$163.61CSCOCisco$46.96InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTexas Instrument (TXN)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comOne of the top technology firms in the nation, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally.

In contrast, the Nasdaq Composite index dropped nearly 15% during the same period.Currently, Texas Instruments carries a forward yield of 2.7%. This ranks conspicuously above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Further, its payout ratio pings at 59.28%. As well, the company commands 19 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Therefore, it’s unlikely that management will give up this trend without a fight.Financially, Texas Instruments features a stable balance sheet (an Altman Z-Score of 12.85) and excellent profitability margins. These attributes may have contributed to Wall Street analysts rating TXN as a consensus moderate buy. Further, TipRanks notes that hedge fund sentiment rates as “positive.” Therefore, it offers a solid choice among dividend stocks to buy.Story continuesUnited Parcel Service (UPS)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA stalwart in the shipping and receiving industry, United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) represents a critical cog in the broader supply chain management complex.
