Goldman missed expectations after reporting rising costs and more provisions for credit losses, a warning sign that credit quality could diminish in coming months as the economy cools.Other banks have also set aside more for possible credit losses, with some bank CEOs hinting at a mild recession coming. As corporate earnings continue to roll out in the next few days and weeks, investors will be listening to what company CEOs say about business conditions for proof that a recession is on the horizon.The Federal Reserve's beige book due out on Wednesday could also provide some insights from observations made by Fed officials in each of the districts across the country. And retail sales data could be another factor in the Fed's upcoming decision on interest rates.After raising rates at an aggressive pace last year, the Fed is expected to slow down to a raise of one-quarter of a percentage point. Interest rates are still going up, but at a less steep trajectory. Investors have been trying to pinpoint the moment when the Fed will pause its rate hiking, and maybe even start to cut.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:1. Producer pricesThe PPI for December is due out at 8:30 ET (13:30 GMT). Analysts expect the month-to-month number to fall 0.1% compared to a gain of 0.3% in November. The year-over-year reading is expected to be up 6.8% versus the 7.4% for the year ending in November. The beige book is due out at 14:00 ET.2. Retail salesRetail sales for December are due out at 8:30 ET also. Analysts expect sales to contract 0.8% for the month compared with a decline of 0.6% in November.3.

This compares to earnings of $10.81 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -36.76%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this investment bank would post earnings of $7.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $8.25, delivering a surprise of 10.44%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Goldman , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, posted revenues of $10.59 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.71%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $12.64 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Goldman shares have added about 8.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.2%.What's Next for Goldman?While Goldman has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Goldman: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

The current consensus EPS estimate is $9.97 on $13.42 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $35.65 on $50.75 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

5,5591e74e-09fd-39b7-a430-ed83ca8fe722,SCHW,2023-01-18,Build-A-Bear Workshop and Bally's have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/build-bear-workshop-ballys-highlighted-131701792.html,1673961421,STORY,"['BBW', 'SCHW']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – January 17, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Build-A-Bear Workshop BBW as the Bull of the Day and Bally's Corp. BALY as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Charles Schwab SCHW, Hancock Whitney Corp. HWC and Truist Financial Corp. TFC.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Build-A-Bear Workshop, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has broken out of a long base in a powerful move to the upside amid the recent equity rally. Simply put, not many stocks finished 2022 in positive territory, let alone witness a surge to multi-year highs. The bullish price action is a sign of strength as BBW looks to continue its momentum into the new year.BBW sports the highest Zacks Value Style Score of 'A,' indicating an increased likelihood that the stock propels higher on favorable valuation metrics. The company is part of the Zacks Retail – Miscellaneous industry group, which ranks in the top 24% out of approximately 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because this industry is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect it to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months, just as it has over the preceding 3-month period.Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock's price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It's no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.Company DescriptionBuild-A-Bear Workshop operates as a multi-channel retailer of plush animals and related products. The company offers various styles of plush products that are pre-stuffed or to-be-stuffed, along with sounds and scents that can be added to the stuffed animals. In addition, BBW provides a range of clothing, shoes, accessories, and other toy and novelty items.Story continuesBBW conducts its stores under the Build-A-Bear Workshop brand name and sells its products through several e-commerce sites. The company operates more than 300 stores in the United States and Canada; 41 stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland; and 72 franchised stores internationally.Earnings Trends and Future Estimates BBW has built up an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates three of the past four quarters. Back in November of last year, the company reported Q3 EPS of $0.51/share, a 34.21% surprise over the $0.38 consensus estimate. BBW has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 14.73%.Growth for the retailer is expected to remain hot in the coming quarters. For the current quarter, the Q1 Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.02/share, reflecting growth of 14.61% relative to the same quarter last year.Analysts covering BBW have increased their full-year EPS estimates by +10.31% in the past 60 days. The fiscal 2024 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $3.21/share, translating to potential growth of 11.46% relative to last year. Sales are anticipated to climb 5.47% to $485.6 million.Let's Get TechnicalSince bottoming out back in September of last year, BBW shares have advanced over 90% and are showing no signs of slowing down. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to make this type of price move and widely outperform the major indices. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.The stock has been making a series of higher highs, and the recent pullback represents a solid buying opportunity. With both strong fundamentals and technicals, BBW is poised to continue its outperformance.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, Build-A-Bear Workshop has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and BBW continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year.Bottom LineAt just an 8.45 forward P/E, BBW shares remain relatively undervalued and represent a phenomenal opportunity. Solid institutional buying should continue to provide a tailwind for the stock price. Robust fundamentals combined with a strong technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix.Backed by a leading industry group and robust history of earnings beats, it's not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. This stock market winner continues to prove its doubters wrong, and investors would be wise to consider BBW as a portfolio candidate if they haven't already done so.Bear of the Day:Bally's Corp. is a gaming, hospitality, and entertainment company that engages in casinos, resorts, and online gaming in the United States. BALY offers interactive entertainment experiences through its traditional casino offerings as well as its online sportsbook, bingo, daily fantasy, and iCasino. The company owns and operates 14 casinos that comprise 14,900 slot machines, 500 table games, 3,900 hotel rooms, as well as a horse racetrack across ten states.The Zacks RundownBally's, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a component of the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry group, which ranks in the bottom 38% out of approximately 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.Candidates in the bottom tiers of industries can often be solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in a poor-performing industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is much more difficult.The odds are stacked against BALY, and the stock is agreeing with this notion. BALY experienced a climax top in March of 2021 and has been in a sustained price downtrend ever since. The company is ranked a worst-possible 'F' in our Zacks Momentum Style Score category, indicating further weakness ahead. The share price has been hitting a series of lower lows and represents a compelling short opportunity.Recent Earnings Misses and Deteriorating Outlook BALY has fallen short of estimates in two of the last four quarters. The entertainment company most recently reported Q3 earnings of just $0.01/share back in November of last year, missing the $0.28/share consensus EPS estimate by -96.43%. Bally's has fallen short of estimates by an average of -29.5% over the prior four quarters. Missing estimates by such a wide margin is a huge red flag.Bally's has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. For the current year, analysts have revised their EPS estimates downward by -113.33% in just the past 30 days. The 2023 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate is now $-0.02/share, translating to negative growth of -101.87% versus last year. These falling earnings estimates need to be respected and point to a negative growth trend that bears like to see.Technical OutlookBALY is in a sustained downtrend. The stock is making a series of lower lows, with no respite from the selling in sight. Also, both moving averages have rolled over and are sloping down – another good sign for the bears.While not the most accurate indicator, BALY has also experienced what is known as a ""death cross,"" wherein the stock's 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. BALY would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. The stock has fallen nearly 40% in the past year alone.Final ThoughtsA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to ""hit it big"" anytime soon. The fact that BALY is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock's downtrend.Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of a down-trending BALY until the situation shows major signs of improvement.Additional content:Higher Rates, Robust Trading to Aid Schwab's (SCHW) Q4 EarningsCharles Schwab is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2022 results on Jan 18, before market open. Its revenues and earnings in the quarter are expected to have improved on a year-over-year basis.In third-quarter 2022, Schwab's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from higher rates, which led to a rise in net interest income. Also, the absence of fee waivers and solid brokerage account numbers acted as tailwinds in the quarter. However, higher expenses hurt results to some extent.The company does not have an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two and lagged in two of the trailing four quarters.Schwab's activities in the to-be-reported quarter encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for SCHW's fourth-quarter earnings has been revised 1.9% higher to $1.10. The estimate indicates an increase of 27.9% from the year-ago quarter's reported number. Our estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is $1.05.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $5.57 billion, which suggests an increase of 18.4% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure. Our estimate for total revenues is $5.49 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 16.7%.SCHW projects 2022 revenue growth of 11-13%, assuming the market's forward rate expectations as of early-October.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let's check the factors that are likely to have impacted Schwab's fourth-quarter performance.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q4Similar to the first three quarters of 2022, market volatility and client activity were robust in the fourth quarter. Few developments, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and continued supply-chain disruptions, led to ambiguity among investors.Also, the ultra-aggressive stance of the central banks across the globe to control inflation and resultant fears of an economic downturn/recession drove client activity and trading volumes. These factors led to heightened volatility in the equity markets and other asset classes, including commodities, bonds and foreign exchange.Investors seemed interested in entering the markets. In October, SCHW opened 298,000 new brokerage accounts. In November, brokerage accounts opened were 303,000.While Schwab's trading performance is expected to have been robust in the quarter under review, supported by higher volatility and client activity, trading revenues are not expected to have improved much from the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter trading revenues is pegged at $905 million, which suggests a decline of 11% from the prior-year quarter's reported number. Our estimate for trading revenues is $1.05 billion.Then, the consensus estimate for average interest-earning assets for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $540 billion, which suggests a decline of 8.2% from the prior-year quarter's reported level. Our estimate for average interest-earning assets is $617.2 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 4.9%.In the fourth quarter, the Federal Reserve continued with its ultra-hawkish monetary policy stance, raising interest rates by another 125 basis points. The policy rate reached 4.25-4.50%, the highest in the past 15 years. Also, the overall lending scenario was decent.Thus, supported by loan growth and higher interest rates, Schwab's net interest revenues are likely to have been positively impacted. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest revenues is pegged at $3 billion, which suggests a year-over-year rise of 39.9%. Our estimate for the same is also $3 billion.Management expects net interest revenues of $3 billion in the fourth quarter as well. Net interest margin is expected to be in the mid-210 bps zone.The consensus estimate for asset management and administration fees of $1.07 billion suggests a decline of 3.3% from the prior-year quarter's reported number. Our estimate for the same is $1.02 billion, indicating a year-over-year fall of 8.3%.Coming to expenses, Schwab's operating expenses have been elevated in the past few quarters. Due to the persistent regulatory spending and strategic buyouts to drive efficiency, overall expenses are expected to have been high in the to-be-reported quarter. We project total expenses to rise 12.7% year over year to $3.03 billion.What the Zacks Model UnveilsAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is +1.08%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Other Stocks Worth a LookA few other finance stocks, which you may want to consider, as these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases per our model, are Hancock Whitney Corp. and Truist Financial Corp..Hancock Whitney is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Jan 17.

6,80dd8a66-8b19-3e73-b084-025d6559905a,TXN,2023-01-18,Analysts Estimate Texas Instruments (TXN) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-texas-instruments-txn-150003200.html,1673967603,STORY,['TXN'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Texas Instruments (TXN) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.96 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.7%.Revenues are expected to be $4.6 billion, down 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Texas Instruments?For Texas Instruments, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.30%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Texas Instruments will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Texas Instruments would post earnings of $2.37 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.45, delivering a surprise of +3.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Texas Instruments doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

7,2a48d0b9-c8c7-348d-a2f5-37761236d821,TXN,2023-01-18,Industry's first ultrasonic lens cleaning chipset enables self-cleaning cameras and sensors,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/industrys-first-ultrasonic-lens-cleaning-145600962.html,1673967360,STORY,['TXN'],"[Designers can create reliable, small and affordable cleaning systems for automotive and industrial applications using TI's ULC technologyDALLAS, Jan. 17, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Texas Instruments (TI) (Nasdaq: TXN) today introduced the first purpose-built semiconductors with ultrasonic lens cleaning (ULC) technology, enabling camera systems to quickly detect and remove dirt, ice and water using microscopic vibrations.The first ultrasonic lens cleaning IC with automatic material detectionRemoving contaminants from camera lenses traditionally requires manual cleaning, causing system downtime, or the use of various mechanical parts that could malfunction. TI's new ULC chipset, including the ULC1001 digital signal processor (DSP) and companion DRV2901 piezo transducer driver, features a proprietary technology that allows cameras to rapidly self-clear contaminants using precisely controlled vibrations to rapidly eliminate debris, which improves system accuracy and reduces maintenance requirements. The chipset offers designers a compact and affordable way to use ULC in a wide range of applications and camera sizes. For more information, see www.ti.com/ulc1001-pr and www.ti.com/drv2901-pr.""ULC can make widespread use of self-cleaning cameras and sensors a reality. Existing cleaning approaches are expensive and impractical, requiring complicated mechanics, costly electronics and significant processing to detect contaminants and execute cleaning,"" said Avi Yashar, product marketing engineer at TI. ""With the recent proliferation of cameras in a variety of applications, from automotive and traffic cameras to smart cities and manufacturing, there's a strong need for a simple, cost-effective way to enable self-cleaning cameras.""The ULC1001 controller includes proprietary algorithms for automatic sensing, cleaning, and temperature and fault detection without any image processing, making ULC technology highly adaptable to various camera lens designs. The chipset's small form factor makes it possible to improve machine vision and sensing in a variety of applications – any place that a camera or sensor could get dirty. To learn how it works, read the technical article, ""Ultrasonic Lens Cleaning: A Solid-State Technology You Didn't Know You Needed.""Story continues""As advanced driver assistance systems [ADAS] become more sophisticated and drivers rely on them more extensively, it will become more important than ever that the sensor suite is fully operational at all times,"" said Edward Sanchez, senior analyst, global automotive practice, TechInsights. ""Dirt or foreign material on a camera lens, which would be just a nuisance in the case of a rearview camera, becomes a vital functional and safety issue on a vehicle that relies on accurate and precise imaging and sensor data. TI's ULC approach addresses what will soon be a significant issue in the ADAS and autonomous vehicle market both practically and cost-effectively.""Reduce system size and complexity with an integrated solutionTI's ULC chipset eliminates the need for complex mechanical parts and human intervention in lens cleaning systems. The ULC1001 ultrasonic cleaning DSP with proprietary algorithms integrates a pulse-width modulator, current- and voltage-sense amplifiers and an analog-to-digital converter. Used together with the DRV2901 piezo transducer driver as a companion amplifier, TI's chipset enables ULC in a compact footprint with a printed circuit board size less than 25 mm by 15 mm, reducing the bill of materials while providing more functionality than a discrete implementation.Package, availability and pricingThe ULC1001 DSP is in volume production and available for purchase on TI.com and authorized distributors in a 4.5-mm-by-5-mm, 32-pin HotRod™ quad flat no-lead (QFN) package, with pricing at US$6.43 in 1,000-unit quantities. The DRV2901 piezo transducer driver is available for purchase for US$5.35 in 1,000-unit quantities. Full reels are available on TI.com and through other channels. The evaluation module, ULC1001-DRV290XEVM, can be requested on TI.com for US$249.

Nucor (NUE), which belongs to the Zacks Steel - Producers industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This steel company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4.65%.For the most recent quarter, Nucor was expected to post earnings of $6.45 per share, but it reported $6.50 per share instead, representing a surprise of 0.78%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $8.91 per share, while it actually produced $9.67 per share, a surprise of 8.53%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Nucor, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Nucor has an Earnings ESP of +0.54% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 26, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

11,68dcb755-5f60-3d60-b650-d6c9fee468cb,NUE,2023-01-18,7 Cheap Retirement Stocks to Make Your Golden Years Shine,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-cheap-retirement-stocks-golden-212008169.html,1673731208,STORY,"['TGT', 'PSX', 'NUE', 'ADM', 'HRL', 'IBM', 'VALE', 'MCS']","[While your golden years might be decades away, it’s never too early to plan ahead, particularly with cheap retirement stocks to buy now. Usually, the basic formula for retirement plays focuses on fiscal stability, reliable growth, and passive income. Unfortunately, the best enterprise that meets these attributes tends to be pricey.To mitigate this situation, you can instead target cheap retirement stocks to buy. And by cheap, we’re not talking about securities that are priced “low” for their own sake. Rather, these enterprises may be overlooked for whatever reason. But if you’re willing to step a bit outside your comfort zone, these ideas could be intriguing.So, if you want to skip the line on that senior discount, these are the cheap retirement stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$88.40HRLHormel Foods$46.10VALEVale$18.43PSXPhillips 66$103.03MCSMarcus$15.47NUENucor$157.56IBMInternational Business Machines$145.89Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)Coins stacked next to a calculator that says ""retirement plan."" Retirement stocks.Source: kenary820 / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) is a multinational food processing and commodities trading corporation. Commanding a critical service, ADM fundamentally makes for one of the cheap retirement stocks to buy. Sure enough, it represented a top performer in 2022. In the trailing year, shares gained over 23% of equity value.Not surprisingly, Archer Daniels Midland enjoys support from the analyst community. Wall Street experts rate ADM as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target hits $107.25, implying a nearly 23% upside from the time of writing. As well, the company carries a forward yield of 1.83%, which sits just under the consumer staples sector average of 1.89%.Financially, ADM makes ranks among the cheap retirement stocks to buy because of its undervalued profile. Right now, the market prices shares of ADM at 12 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector average stands at 17.3 times. Moreover, ADM enjoys strong business quality based on its well above-average return on equity of 17.6%.Story continuesHormel Foods (HRL)retirement stocks: a roadsign that says ""retirement ahead"". retirement stocksSource: ShutterstockCalling Austin, Minnesota, home Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) is a food-processing specialist. It features a long history, founded in 1891. One of the attributes bolstering Hormel is demand inelasticity. Irrespective of pricing fluctuations due to economic conditions, people must eat. And that bodes well for HRL, making it one of the cheap retirement stocks to buy.To be fair, HRL dipped 6% in the trailing year. Nevertheless, analysts remain undeterred, pegging Hormel as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target is $50.33, implying a potential upside of slightly over 8%. As well, the company carries a forward yield of 2.36%, again beating out the consumer staples sector’s average 1.89% yield.Based on traditional financial metrics, Hormel provides an intriguing look for cheap retirement stocks. For instance, its Altman Z-Score hit 4.9, reflecting stability in its finances. Plus, the food enterprise enjoys strong profitability metrics. Finally, based on Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value, HRL rates as modestly undervalued.Vale (VALE)retirement stocks an older couple sitting on a dock and looking at a pamphletSource: ShutterstockAlthough metals and mining firms don’t usually make the list of cheap retirement stocks to buy, people should arguably make an exception for Vale (NYSE:VALE). Based in Brazil, Vale is the largest producer of iron ore and nickel in the world, per its corporate profile. The latter commodity presents significant implications because of its integration into electric vehicle batteries.Certainly, the “ifs” and “when” of EV integration spark much debate. However, what’s not debatable are the facts. For example, in the trailing year, shares gained slightly over 20%. Another fact is that at the moment, all six covering analysts rate VALE as a consensus strong buy. For full disclosure, because of the stock’s dramatic upswing, it’s already met its prior price target.Moving forward, Vale offers an intriguing idea among cheap retirement stocks. Its forward yield of 3.2% beats out the materials sector average of 2.8%. Also, the market prices VALE at 7.7 times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median stands at 13.85 times.Phillips 66 (PSX)retirement stocks: miniature figurines climb a staircase made of coinsSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, energy giant Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) likely presents ongoing relevance because of its downstream enterprise. Specializing in the segment involving refining and marketing, Phillips 66 may benefit from ongoing social normalization trends. In particular, with high-profile companies demanding that their workers return to the office, traffic levels should increase. That should make PSX one of the lucrative cheap retirement stocks to buy.Presently, covering analysts rate PSX as a consensus moderate buy. Though PSX already gained 18.5% in the trailing year, analysts anticipate shares hitting $122.42. This average target implies an upside potential of 19%. Further, on the passive income side, Phillips 66 offers a forward yield of 3.77%. It’s generous though admittedly a bit under the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%.Just as well, PSX objectively rates as one of the cheap retirement stocks to buy. Right now, the market prices shares of PSX at 4.7 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median stands at 8.2 times.Marcus (MCS)a financial planner showing a couple a piece of paperSource: ShutterstockOne of the cheap retirement stocks to buy that also flies well under the radar, Marcus (NYSE:MCS) is an enterprise with two principal divisions: Marcus Theatres and Marcus Hotels and Resorts. Personally, I’m interested in the former. Because Marcus provides box office-based entertainment to more rural regions – you know, the places where millennials moved to because of cost-of-living reasons – MCS could be a surprise hit.Granted, on paper, it doesn’t seem that way. In the trailing year, MCS gave up 11.5% of equity value. However, covering analysts rate Marcus as a consensus strong buy. Also, they anticipate a recovery, targeting an average price forecast of $21. This implies an upside of almost 36%. To be fair, though, it’s not a perfect play among cheap retirement stocks to buy. For instance, its forward yield sits at a paltry 1.29%.Adding to the concerns, it’s not as if the box office represents a bastion of confidence as it is. However, the company’s earnings performance trend gradually improved from the abyss of the coronavirus pandemic. If you have many years before retirement, Marcus could be worth it on its long-term recovery potential.Nucor (NUE)an elderly couple jumping up in a white household. Cheap retirement stocksSource: ShutterstockAn American producer of steel and related products, Nucor (NYSE:NUE) incurred a choppy ride throughout 2022. However, the net picture overall has been resoundingly positive. In the trailing year, NUE gained a remarkable 38% in equity value. For context, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index slipped 14.5% during the same period.Despite its outperformance, NUE still ranks among the cheap retirement stocks to buy for those thinking long-term. For instance, the Biden administration’s initiatives to boost American infrastructure across the board should generally benefit NUE. As a small bonus, NUE carries a forward yield of 1.31%.Still, for full disclosure, analysts apparently believe that most of the good news has been baked in. At the time of writing, NUE features a consensus view of hold. It also has an average negative price target of 8.6%.Nevertheless, it’s difficult to ignore the value, especially if you’re thinking long-term. Currently, the market prices shares of NUE at 4.9 times trailing earnings, below the sector median of 8.15 times. Also, Nucar enjoys a strong balance sheet and excellent profitability metrics.IBM (IBM)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comFor many years, legacy tech giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) represented an afterthought in the digital innovation space. While its peers pushed into sectors such as cloud computing, IBM still had exposure to legacy hardware businesses. However, that’s a chapter in the past. Today, Big Blue embraces myriad innovations, not only including hybrid cloud initiatives but also the blockchain.Another reason to consider IBM is that it makes for a great idea among cheap retirement stocks to buy. Presently, the iconic firm offers a forward yield of 4.53%. That’s a stout source of passive income. As well, IBM enjoys 29 years of consecutive dividend increases. Don’t expect management to give up on this status, even with the high 66% payout ratio.Now, according to Gurufocus.com, the tech giant rates as fairly valued. Nevertheless, I believe it’s one of the cheap retirement stocks to buy now. For one thing, it has a forward PE of 15.1 times, well below the industry median of 24.4. As well, its price-to-projected-free-cash-flow ratio is 1.04 times, below the median of 1.57 times.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

UNM estimates 45-55% growth in adjusted operating EPS by 2024.

AFL, Reinsurance Group of America Inc. RGA, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Inc. MMC, Unum Group UNM and The Travelers Companies Inc. TRV.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:5 Insurance Stocks to Buy Ahead of Q4 Earnings ResultsWall Street kicked off the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings season last Friday. However, the season will gather pace this week. This reporting cycle will be important as market participants will closely monitor any sign of earnings, revenues or margin decline.A large section of economists and financial experts are concerned that the U.S. economy may face at least a mild recession in 2023 with a higher interest rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed.Nevertheless, five insurers are likely to beat Q4 2022 earnings results. These are - Aflac Inc., Reinsurance Group of America Inc., Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Inc., Unum Group and The Travelers Companies Inc.Insurance Sector Q4 2022An improving interest rate environment benefits life insurers as their products and investments are rate sensitive. A favorable interest rate thus impacts life insurers' earnings, capital and reserves, liquidity, and competitiveness positively.Insurance brokerage firms are continuously expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products. The rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance.Story continuesTo maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. Insurers are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate.Accelerated digitization is also curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. It will also help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and retention rate. While investments in technology increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, insurers must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Our Top PicksFive insurance companies are set to beat on fourth quarter earnings results. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a positive Earnings ESP.

SIG, NRG Energy, Inc. NRG, Unum Group UNM and Sterling Infrastructure STRL.Pick These Low P/CF Stocks to Spruce Up Your PortfolioValue style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock's inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company's financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Signet Jewelers Ltd., NRG Energy, Inc., Unum Group and Sterling Infrastructure boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company's earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company's liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company's liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesHowever, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:Signet, the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry, sports a Zacks Rank #1. It has an expected EPS growth rate of 8% for three-five years. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Signet has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 44.8%, on average. SIG has a Value Score of A.

He had never been approached by a financial institution that wanted to connect with the at-risk kids he serves to discuss how they can build a path to someday become homeowners.Just a few minutes into the discussion, Jackson was on board with partnering and shared his ideas on how to help serve middle and high school students in Little Rock, Arkansas.""What we must do is get around the dinner table with these kids and talk finance. That's something we don't do enough of in households of color,"" he said.By the end of that initial 30-minute phone call, though, plans for a series of U.S. Bank dinner conversations were underway. Soon, more than 40 young adults and several U.S. Bank volunteers came together at least monthly, and sometimes weekly, to hold legacy-building conversations ranging from how to start a business to how to save money to buy a home. Delicious food and lively conversation were always on the menu.The volunteer outreach was coordinated through Access Home, an initiative under the U.S. Bank Access Commitment™ focused on removing historical barriers to homeownership and increasing financial literacy. Kids lead the conversation while their parents, guardians, volunteer bankers and other dinner guests listen and learn. At a dinner in late November, U.S. Bank attendees included Tom Wind, Mortgage Division president, Lenny McNeill, executive vice president of National Strategic Markets, and Sodi Nichols, Access Home initiative lead.Many of the adult attendees said they were impressed by the amount of knowledge gained and shared by the P.A.R.K. kids.""My credit score will open doors,"" said one young man in attendance.Story continues""I can use my first home's equity to start a business,"" said another.P.A.R.K. founder Jackson is a native of Little Rock and played in the NFL from 1988-1997 for the Philadelphia Eagles, Miami Dolphins and Green Bay Packers, helping the Packers win Super Bowl XXXI. He was still playing in the NFL when he came up with the vision for P.A.R.K. as an after-school academic ministry that helps kids go to college. Participants typically enroll in the year-round program when they are 12 or 13, and it lasts for five years.In Little Rock, P.A.R.K. and U.S. Bank also partner with Junior Achievement to teach children the financial concepts behind home ownership. Recently, U.S. Bank volunteers used Junior Achievement's unique delivery system and Fannie Mae's homeownership materials to teach nearly 300 kindergarten through fifth grade students at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School.U.S. Bank offers employees 16 hours of paid time off to volunteer in their communities, and for the upcoming Martin Luther King Day observance encourages paricipation in events, programs or groups that are grounded in visions of freedom, equality and justice.Little Rock is one of five markets where U.S. Bank launched Access Home to help close the home ownership gap in black communities where the disparity is the greatest. In each of those markets, U.S. Bank is working closely with a total of 18 nonprofit partners - including P.A.R.K. -- and enlisting its own bankers as volunteers to share their time and talents providing outreach and education to aspiring homeowners.""We cannot do this alone and we have so much appreciation and gratitude for our partners and our own volunteers who are bringing this work to communities across the country,"" said Nichols, Access Home initiative lead.

20,7a960a06-b041-3633-854e-7f2cc8486651,WMT,2023-01-18,TSCDY or WMT: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tscdy-wmt-better-value-stock-164004374.html,1673973604,STORY,"['TSCDY', 'WMT']","[Investors looking for stocks in the Retail - Supermarkets sector might want to consider either Tesco PLC (TSCDY) or Walmart (WMT). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Tesco PLC and Walmart are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that TSCDY's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.TSCDY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.80, while WMT has a forward P/E of 23.91. We also note that TSCDY has a PEG ratio of 2.69. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. WMT currently has a PEG ratio of 4.35.Another notable valuation metric for TSCDY is its P/B ratio of 1.36.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Aflac Inc. AFL, Reinsurance Group of America Inc. RGA, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Inc. MMC, Unum Group UNM and The Travelers Companies Inc. TRV.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:5 Insurance Stocks to Buy Ahead of Q4 Earnings ResultsWall Street kicked off the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings season last Friday. However, the season will gather pace this week. This reporting cycle will be important as market participants will closely monitor any sign of earnings, revenues or margin decline.A large section of economists and financial experts are concerned that the U.S. economy may face at least a mild recession in 2023 with a higher interest rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed.Nevertheless, five insurers are likely to beat Q4 2022 earnings results. These are - Aflac Inc., Reinsurance Group of America Inc., Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Inc., Unum Group and The Travelers Companies Inc.Insurance Sector Q4 2022An improving interest rate environment benefits life insurers as their products and investments are rate sensitive. A favorable interest rate thus impacts life insurers' earnings, capital and reserves, liquidity, and competitiveness positively.Insurance brokerage firms are continuously expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products. The rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance.Story continuesTo maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. Insurers are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate.Accelerated digitization is also curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. It will also help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and retention rate. While investments in technology increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, insurers must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Our Top PicksFive insurance companies are set to beat on fourth quarter earnings results.

However, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 10.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for Danaher this earnings season.Factors to NoteStrength in food, beverage and consumer end-markets, robust demand for analytical chemistries and consumables and steady activity levels in the municipal and industrial project are likely to have aided Danaher’s Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions segment in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions segment revenues suggests a 0.7% increase from the year-ago reported figure.However, high raw material costs, logistics problems, high freight costs and supply-chain issues (primarily relating to a shortage of components) are likely to have affected Danaher’s margin performance in the fourth quarter. Given the company’s substantial international presence, foreign currency headwinds are expected to have impacted the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Danaher’s Life Sciences segment reflects a year-over-year decline of 0.6%. We expect the same to fall 2.3% for the fourth quarter.Danaher Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Danaher Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseDanaher Corporation price-eps-surprise | Danaher Corporation Quote The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Diagnostics segment revenues shows a 17.8% decline from the year-ago reported number. For the fourth quarter, we expect the same to decrease 14.7% year over year.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Danaher this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here, as elaborated below. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earnings ESP: Danaher has an Earnings ESP of -0.05%. You can uncover the best stocks before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Danaher currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Story continuesHighlights of Q3 EarningsDanaher’s third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings (excluding 46 cents from non-recurring items) of $2.56 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.24. The bottom line increased 7.1% from the year-ago quarter primarily on sales growth. Danaher’s net sales of $7,663 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,092 million and increased 6% year over year.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies which according to our model have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in this reporting cycle.IDEX Corporation IEX has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

26,47322443-9735-309f-ae00-7e5cb55ad336,HBAN,2023-01-18,First Busey (BUSE) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-busey-buse-earnings-expected-150003039.html,1673967603,STORY,"['BUSE', 'HBAN']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when First Busey (BUSE) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.74 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +21.3%.Revenues are expected to be $122.47 million, up 16% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for First Busey?For First Busey, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +10.81%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that First Busey will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that First Busey would post earnings of $0.64 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.65, delivering a surprise of +1.56%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.First Busey appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry, Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.41 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +13.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.95 billion, up 18.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Huntington Bancshares has been revised 1.1% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.92%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Huntington Bancshares will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Check Out These 2 Finance Names,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-stocks-positive-earnings-momentum-140002618.html,1673964002,STORY,"['AIG', 'HBAN']","[Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. American International Group (AIG) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.29 a share 29 days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 15, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.29 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.14 Zacks Consensus Estimate, American International Group has an Earnings ESP of 13.33%.AIG is part of a big group of Finance stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) as well.Huntington Bancshares, which is readying to report earnings on January 20, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.41 a share, and HBAN is three days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Huntington Bancshares is $0.41, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.92%.Story continuesAIG and HBAN's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Since we are sort of getting used to it, are global markets, global political systems sort of underestimating the threat that it still poses?IAN BREMMER: Certainly, anyone thinking about investing in Europe is underestimating it because it's so structural for the Europeans. First of all, I mean, energy supply is permanently shifted to anything but Russia. And those gas pipelines, which have actually been blown up-- Nord Stream 1 and 2-- are not coming back online.JULIE HYMAN: And we've been lulled by the warm winter so it hasn't been as severe as thought.IAN BREMMER: Right.JULIE HYMAN: But that's not--IAN BREMMER: But it's still an expensive--JULIE HYMAN: That could change.IAN BREMMER: --and permanent structural change. Well, if anything, it's probably gonna get warmer. So but--JULIE HYMAN: [LAUGHS]IAN BREMMER: Leaving that aside, the fact that you have millions of refugees from Ukraine living in Poland, housed by the Europeans, that's a big deal. The fact that the Europeans are now going to have to spend vastly more on defense than they had to over the last 30 years, that is a constraint on what they can use their fiscal balances for domestically. That's new. That's a permanent change.And so, I mean, I think what we have to understand is it's been 30 years of peace dividend that the Europeans have benefited for-- from. It's over. And we're not in a cold war with Russia. We're in a hot war with Russia that we're fighting by proxy in Ukraine.But Russia's ability to use disinformation, to engage in cyber attacks against critical infrastructure, to blow up pipelines or fiber, to have proxy engagement and terrorism on the ground in NATO, those are now active threats that Europeans, principally, are going to have to defend themselves against. That is absolutely underpriced in the markets.]"

There, the documents show Pemex burnt off some 62.9 billion cubic feet of gas and 310,000 barrels of condensate.Story continuesThat is the equivalent of 31% of the total amount of gas produced from the field, and 1.3% of total condensate, according to Reuters calculations.The documents were sent to the country's energy minister, Rocio Nahle, the head of regulatory compliance at Pemex's exploration and production arm, and senior officials at the regulator and the interior ministry.MISSING INFRASTRUCTUREPemex produced 201.2 billion cubic feet of gas and 24.3 million barrels of condensate from Ixachi. But it still fell short of its targets.The documents also show that 77.6% of the investment into the field Pemex had pledged in its development plan - totaling $2.9 billion - were not made.Lopez Obrador declared early on in his presidency that Ixachi and Quesqui formed part of 17 new priority fields expected to dramatically boost national production as part of a wider effort to make the country energy independent.The fields were meant to receive more resources so Pemex can start exploration and production earlier and faster and make up for declining production from ageing fields elsewhere.But Pemex failed to complete the wells, pipelines and other infrastructure needed to produce gas and condensate from the fields without high levels of waste.In Ixachi, the destruction of value from burning off condensate was more than $21 million in three years; in Quesqui, it was almost $8 million in two years, the documents show.It has not previously been reported that condensate was also burnt off at the fields. Under Mexican law, documentation around such violations is not made public.""The objective should be to maximize making use of all hydrocarbon products in the field,"" one of the documents said, adding that ""(Pemex) does not meet production it committed to because wells and infrastructure are not in place"".In the documents, the regulator also recommends changes so that Pemex ""avoids the burning off and the destruction of commercial value of the hydrocarbon products.""Pemex has historically deemed investing in infrastructure to explore and produce gas too expensive and instead imported much of it from the United States.In recent years, it has come under pressure because of the environmental damage associated with burning off gas.Late last year, Pemex acknowledged in its updated business plan for 2023 to 2027 that its poor environmental, social and governance (ESG) record risked hurting its financing as rivals were transitioning faster to clean energies.(Reporting by Stefanie EschenbacherEditing by Stephen Eisenhammer and Lisa Shumaker)]"

""We didn't execute perfectly on some so we've taken a hard look at those, and you make adjustments.""LOW BARUBS analysts wrote in a note Morgan Stanley's fourth-quarter core trends were encouraging and cleared the low bar.Revenue from Morgan Stanley's investment banking business fell 49% to $1.25 billion in the fourth quarter, with revenue declines across the bank's advisory, equity and fixed income segments.The investment banking business slowdown weighed on the company's net revenue, pulling it down 12% to $12.7 billion.""I am highly confident that when the Fed pauses, deal activity and underwriting activity will go up,"" Chief Executive Officer James Gorman told analysts in a call.Still, Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that the bank is comfortable with its headcount after recent layoffs. Morgan Stanley had cut 2% of its headcount in December, or about 1,600 jobs, a source had told Reuters.Trading has been a surprise bright spot for Morgan Stanley, with the unit's revenue jumping 26% in the fourth quarter, as clients look to hedge against market risks by rejiggering portfolios toward more defensive assets.Looking ahead, Gorman said the bank's wealth and investment management businesses are expected to become an increasingly larger portion of the firm's pre-tax profit in the coming years.The wealth management unit has also helped the bank keep its funding cost lower amid a rate hiking cycle, the CEO added.Mark-to-market losses on corporate loans came in at $876 million, as interest rates rose. It includes debt to Twitter, the CFO said. Morgan Stanley is among a group of banks that provided a $13 billion loan to finance Elon Musk's acquisition of the social media company.Updating Morgan Stanley's outlook, the CFO said the bank's net interest income, or the money banks bring in from interest payments, has not peaked, although it is likely to reduce its growth rate this year.

First, we got to take note of the moves that we saw in Goldman Sachs, and also what we saw in Morgan Stanley. I mentioned the fact that the Dow was off 391 points. A lot of that had to do with underperformance that we saw in Goldman with that stock closing off about 6 and 1/2%. The drop there coming after the company missed on earnings on both the top and bottom lines, posted a profit drop of just about 70%.And comparing that with what we heard from Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley numbers were actually relatively strong, especially when you're comparing it to what we saw, more broadly speaking, across that sector. But Morgan Stanley beating on both the top and bottom line. Record wealth management revenue, that sent shares up nearly 6% today.They also posted some growth at their trading business. CEO James Gorman saying that he is more confident that deal-making is going to come back around once the Fed does, in fact, pause its rate hikes. And that's a big contributing factor to some of the gains that we're seeing in Morgan Stanley today there, Dave.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, really the only optimistic tone we heard from a big bank CEO, and largely because wealth management. But again, they, like everybody else, struggle with investment banking, which is essentially down about 50% for all the big banks, which drove Goldman Sachs to that disastrous report, profits down about 70%. So, yeah, Morgan Stanley really dragging the Dow down-- up and Goldman Sachs driving it right back down.What's the real theme? Investment banking is going to struggle. Set aside a billion dollars, and everybody set aside hundreds of millions, if not more, for future loan losses. Really, the two themes that have emerged, with everyone predicting a mild recession ahead, is really the bank story.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly, it is. And I think you have to really just-- it begs the question as to how bad it's going to get. And if you compare some of the commentary, at least for Jamie Dimon now saying we're expecting a mild recession, that's a huge step down from the hurricane that he had predicted just about a year ago. So maybe things aren't going to be as bad as some investors had been bracing for. But I think we can really bet on a slowing-- slowing growth, slower growth environment going forward.DAVID BRIGGS: Jamie Dimon's never going to outrun the hurricane, is he?SEANA SMITH: I don't know.DAVID BRIGGS: You think 10 years from now, we're still talking about the hurricane?SEANA SMITH: I hope not. I hope something else happens between now and then. But at least--DAVID BRIGGS: He's accomplished an awful lot. But that is every time--SEANA SMITH: And he walked it back. To be fair, he did kind of walk it back, put it more in context. But really, that hurricane headline grabbed a lot of headlines.DAVID BRIGGS: It's a tombstone headline. All right, let's talk about Alibaba, shares falling on the first day of trading since famed meme stock leader Ryan Cohen bought shares in the Chinese e-commerce giant. Baba shares sinking as a slew of warning signs come out of China, including declining population and shrinking GDP growth. It is interesting when you look at some of the big losers on the NASDAQ on the day, Baidu, JD.com, Pinduoduo, three of the biggest four losers on the NASDAQ.But back to Ryan Cohen and his move here with Alibaba. Look, likely to be unsuccessful. This is not a meme stock. This is not anything like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond or GameStop for the obvious reason that you're dealing with the Chinese government here.You're not just talking about investors. You're not talking about our markets. You're talking about one thing you cannot control is the Chinese government, who is obviously a stakeholder and has really clamped down on the Chinese tech sector. Even if that's loosening, they ultimately have the word here, the last word. And I don't think Ryan Cohen is likely to overcome that.SEANA SMITH: No. I don't think he's going to have the outsize impact that he has had on some of the other companies. And also not to mention Alibaba is a stock that has a $300 billion market cap. So just given the sheer--DAVID BRIGGS: Right.SEANA SMITH: --size of it--DAVID BRIGGS: Right.SEANA SMITH: --you have to question about how much outsize impact he's going to have. He does seem to be that he will be pushing for more buybacks from Alibaba. But of course, we will see how all this plays out.DAVID BRIGGS: Does he just want more retail traders to get involved with the stock? Is that ultimately the goal? He knows what he cannot accomplish here. He knows how small that is in terms of their overall market cap.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and it seems to be, at least taking a look at the reaction from the Street so far, he could get more overseas investors interested in Alibaba again, which, in fact, if he does do that, that, of course, would be a positive here for the stock. He is a high-profile investor. We know he does have a very core following here. So it could add some positive sentiment here to Alibaba, which has been down pretty substantially over the last two years.All right, let's get to a big winner here and that is Roblox, the stock closing up nearly 12%, leading the NASDAQ higher. The driver is solid bookings update here from the company, Roblox estimating that bookings of up to 450 million for December. That beat the Street's expectations. It's important to point out that shares have actually been down over 50% in the past year.And this company is going to stop reporting its monthly numbers this spring. But given the outsized impact that these numbers are having on the stock today, certainly worth it to mention it, daily active users in December jumping 18% year-over-year to 61 and 1/2 million, hours engaged, Dave, almost 5 billion. Impressive numbers here from Roblox. And we're seeing that reflected in the stock move today.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, look, it is a solid, solid number to come out. Can you bet on this long term? It doesn't fit any of the patterns that we've seen in gaming. It doesn't look sustainable when you look at the overall market.It looks like largely something we saw in the short term. But you've got to look at a company that was at, what, $80 in December '21. So it's-- all the positive was really taken out of it. Now-- now there's some upside. I don't believe this is sustainable, but we shall see.]"

There, the documents show Pemex burnt off some 62.9 billion cubic feet of gas and 310,000 barrels of condensate.Story continuesThat is the equivalent of 31% of the total amount of gas produced from the field, and 1.3% of total condensate, according to Reuters calculations.The documents were sent to the country's energy minister, Rocio Nahle, the head of regulatory compliance at Pemex's exploration and production arm, and senior officials at the regulator and the interior ministry.MISSING INFRASTRUCTUREPemex produced 201.2 billion cubic feet of gas and 24.3 million barrels of condensate from Ixachi. But it still fell short of its targets.The documents also show that 77.6% of the investment into the field Pemex had pledged in its development plan - totaling $2.9 billion - were not made.Lopez Obrador declared early on in his presidency that Ixachi and Quesqui formed part of 17 new priority fields expected to dramatically boost national production as part of a wider effort to make the country energy independent.The fields were meant to receive more resources so Pemex can start exploration and production earlier and faster and make up for declining production from ageing fields elsewhere.But Pemex failed to complete the wells, pipelines and other infrastructure needed to produce gas and condensate from the fields without high levels of waste.In Ixachi, the destruction of value from burning off condensate was more than $21 million in three years; in Quesqui, it was almost $8 million in two years, the documents show.It has not previously been reported that condensate was also burnt off at the fields. Under Mexican law, documentation around such violations is not made public.""The objective should be to maximize making use of all hydrocarbon products in the field,"" one of the documents said, adding that ""(Pemex) does not meet production it committed to because wells and infrastructure are not in place"".In the documents, the regulator also recommends changes so that Pemex ""avoids the burning off and the destruction of commercial value of the hydrocarbon products.""Pemex has historically deemed investing in infrastructure to explore and produce gas too expensive and instead imported much of it from the United States.In recent years, it has come under pressure because of the environmental damage associated with burning off gas.Late last year, Pemex acknowledged in its updated business plan for 2023 to 2027 that its poor environmental, social and governance (ESG) record risked hurting its financing as rivals were transitioning faster to clean energies.(Reporting by Stefanie EschenbacherEditing by Stephen Eisenhammer and Lisa Shumaker)]"

57,15fbd13b-8991-3cd8-b2b5-25d6a0366eb1,RL,2023-01-18,4 Reasons Why Ralph Lauren (RL) is a Good Investment Pick Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-why-ralph-lauren-141702297.html,1673965022,STORY,"['RL', 'WWE']","[Ralph Lauren Corporation RL has been gaining from brand strength, solid demand, and expansion across all channels. A solid online show and strong AUR growth bode well. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 25.1% in the past three months compared with the industry's growth of 18.1%.Let’s take a look at the factors that make the stock an attractive pick.Solid Online ShowRalph Lauren has been making significant progress in expanding digital and omni-channel capabilities through investments in mobile, omni-channel and fulfillment. In second-quarter fiscal 2023, digital business continued to be a key growth driver, with accelerated digital sales across all regions. The global digital ecosystem continued to witness robust growth, recording year-over-year mid-teen revenue growth. This includes mid-single-digit growth within the owned Ralph Lauren and digital sites on top of more than 30% growth last year.The company introduced additional digital sites in key markets, including Korea and Australia, in the fiscal second quarter. Revenues for the company’s owned digital sites rose year over year in the mid-single digits, driven by strong full-price selling, stemming from a positive mix of products, investments in AI-powered targeting and consumer acquisition. Also, its online search grew year over year in the low-double digits and exceeded 50 million social media followers on a global basis.Region-wise, digital sales were up 15% in Europe and 22% in Asia. It is focused on further digital investments to continue creating content for all platforms, enhancing digital capabilities to improve the user experience, and leveraging AI and data to serve its consumers efficiently.Ralph Lauren continues to scale and expand its connected retail capabilities, including virtual selling appointments, “buy online, pick up in store,” and endless aisle product availability. The company launched its first-ever full catalog Ralph Lauren mobile app during the holiday season, efficiently leveraging its connected retail capabilities to deliver the most personalized and content-rich platform.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research AUR GrowthContinued momentum in average unit retail (AUR) remains a key growth driver. The metric increased 18% for second-quarter fiscal 2023, marking the 22nd straight AUR growth. The company has been navigating through the ongoing inflationary environment, driven by a favorable product mix and strong pricing power. It expects to deliver above its annual long-term target of low to mid-single-digit AUR growth through fiscal 2023, which will help mitigate mid to high-single-digit cost inflation.The company’s strategy of product elevation, acquisition of full-priced consumers, and favorable channel and geographic mix, as well as ramping up its targeting and personalization efforts, is likely to support long-term AUR growth. This is likely to continue aiding gross margin growth. For fiscal 2023, the gross margin (at cc) is envisioned to expand 30-50 bps on a 52-week comparable basis, driven by solid AUR growth and a positive product mix. This is expected to more than offset higher freight and product cost inflation.Next Great Chapter PlanThe company announced the next phase of its Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan, which aims at creating a simplified global organizational structure and rolling out improved technological capabilities. As part of the initial phase of the plan, it completed the transition of Chaps to a licensed business, concluding its portfolio realignment announced last year. The move will likely enable it to focus on core brands, as part of the Next Great Chapter elevation strategy.For fiscal 2023, RL anticipated revenue growth in the high-single digits or 8% (cc) year over year on a 52-week comparable basis. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company expects year-over-year revenue growth of low to mid-single digits at cc.Impressive ResultsDriven by these factors, RL has been witnessing a robust surprise trend, which continued in second-quarter fiscal 2023. The company reported the ninth straight earnings beat and the seventh consecutive revenue surprise in the fiscal second quarter. Net revenues grew 5% year over year to $1,579.9 million. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, revenues were up 13% from the prior-year quarter. The metric gained from solid growth across all regions.For fiscal 2023, management anticipates year-over-year revenue growth at cc in the high-single digits on a 52-week comparable basis. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company expects year-over-year revenue growth of low to mid-single digits at cc.Bottom LineAlthough freight and currency woes are concerning, we believe that Ralph Lauren is well-placed for long-term growth on the back of brand strength, robust demand, solid online show and strong AUR growth. A Value Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.3% raise optimism in the stock.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are World Wrestling Entertainment WWE, PVH Corp PVH and Oxford Industries OXM.World Wrestling Entertainment currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

To find the Best Markets for First-time Homebuyers, Realtor.com® looked at a number of qualities that make a town attractive, including affordability, livability and where it might be easier for young buyers to break into the housing market. The top 10 markets for first-time homebuyers in 2023 are: Portsmouth, Va., DeForest, Wisc., Windsor Locks, Conn., Gloucester City, N.J., Moore, Okla., Magna, Utah, Eggertsville, N.Y., Watervliet, N.Y., Mattydale, N.Y. and Somersworth, N.H.Realtor.com® Forecasts the 10 Best Markets for First-Time Homebuyers in 2023What makes these towns great for first-time buyers? They have strong job markets, short commute times, plenty of places to eat and drink, a younger population, affordability, and more homes to choose from.""The housing market will continue to be challenging for first-time buyers in the coming year, but for those with a bit of flexibility in where they live, there are markets where young buyers can find not just a relatively affordable home, but a neighborhood that offers a mix of economic opportunity and lifestyle amenities,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""Affordability is always a consideration for first-time buyers, but it's also important to make sure that you're settling down in a location that has all the qualities that make it an enjoyable place to live – after all, you're not just buying a house, you're investing in a community.""This year's best markets have:More homes to choose from: With inventory still near historic lows, having more homes to choose from can make a world of difference. Realtor.com®'s best markets for first-time homebuyers have an average of 47.8 listings per 1,000 households, higher than the national rate of 45.2. Magna, Utah has the widest selection of listings per household on this year's list.Short commutes: Typically, the farther from city centers, the cheaper the homes, but no one wants to spend all day commuting. This year's top towns have an average expected commute time of just 24 minutes. This is significantly faster than the national average of 30 minutes–it would save 50 hours per year for a 5-day commuter. Those looking for an especially short commute should check out Eggertsville, N.Y., which has an average travel time of just 20 minutes.Options for food and drinks: Buying a house doesn't need to mean giving up on a latte or an occasional meal out. The top towns have an average of 5.6 food and drink establishments per 1,000 households in their metro area, higher than the national rate of 5.3. Somersworth, N.H. topped the list for proximity to restaurants.Younger residents: When it comes to picking a new community, younger buyers are often drawn to younger towns. This year's list has an average of 14.8% of residents in the 25-34 year age category, compared to the national average of 13.4%. Magna, Utah (which also made the 2022 list) tied Moore, Okla. as the youngest markets on the list.Affordability: With high home prices and interest rates, affordability is a key factor for first-time homebuyers. The best markets offer an average 2022 listing price to income ratio of 3.5 for 25- 34 year-olds, much lower than the national rate of 5.1. Mattydale, N.Y. and Gloucester City, N.J. tied for the most affordable locations on the list.Strong housing markets: A home is an investment, and this is especially true for first-time buyers who are likely investing a large portion of their savings into a home. To help best protect that investment, it's important to buy in a location that has a strong local housing market and is likely to hold its value, if not appreciate. This year's markets are located within metro areas that have an average forecasted 2023 home sales growth rate of 1.2%, higher than the national rate which is expected to decline -14.1%. In terms of price growth, Somersworth, N.H. is located within the Boston metro area which is expected to have the highest growth in 2023 among the 10 places on our list (+9.5%), followed closely by the Madison metro area containing DeForest, Wisc.(+9.0%).Story continuesRealtor.com® 2023 Best Markets for First-Time HomebuyersRankPlace NameMetro Name2023 Metro Forecast Rank2023 Forecasted 25-34 Year Old Population Share12 Month Ending November 2022 Inventory per 1,000 Households12 Month Ending November 2022 Price to Income Ratio2023 Forecasted Metro UnemploymentRate (%)2020 Food and Drink Establishments per 1,000 Households2023 Forecasted Average Travel Time to Work2023 Metro Forecasted Price Growth2023 MetroForecasted Sales Growth1Portsmouth, Va.Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, Va.-N.C.2115.9 %58.83.93.45.5255.1 %3.9 %2DeForest, Wisc.Madison, Wisc.5615.1 %58.13.62.85.5259.0 %-5.0 %3Windsor Locks, Conn.Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, Conn.112.6 %41.92.73.75.7238.5 %6.5 %4Gloucester City, N.J.Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, Penn.-N.J.-Del.-Md.4313.6 %62.32.23.75.6255.7 %0.6 %5Moore, OklaOklahoma City, Okla3616.8 %54.73.03.15.3272.6 %4.2 %6Magna, UtahSalt Lake City, Utah7316.8 %73.75.12.45.6275.8 %-7.6 %7Eggertsville, N.Y.Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls, N.Y.513.3 %39.03.43.95.4206.0 %6.3 %8Watervliet, N.Y.Albany-Schenectady-Troy, N.Y.2815.9 %18.34.03.35.8224.7 %3.0 %9Mattydale, N.Y.Syracuse, N.Y.3312.9 %40.92.23.65.3216.1 %0.9 %10Somersworth, N.H.Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Mass-N.H.2214.9 %30.14.62.86.2289.5 %-0.6 %USA13.4 %44.95.14.05.3305.4 %-14.1 % Home shoppers can visit Realtor.com® to learn about the process, see if they might be eligible for down payment assistance and find out how much they can afford.

SIG, NRG Energy, Inc. NRG, Unum Group UNM and Sterling Infrastructure STRL.Pick These Low P/CF Stocks to Spruce Up Your PortfolioValue style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock's inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company's financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Signet Jewelers Ltd., NRG Energy, Inc., Unum Group and Sterling Infrastructure boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company's earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company's liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company's liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesHowever, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:Signet, the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

MNST, SEI Investments SEIC, and Paychex PAYX – could all be considered.Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three stocks over the last year, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a closer look at each one.Monster Beverage Corp. Monster Beverage is a marketer and distributor of energy drinks and other alternative beverages. Currently, the company sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In its latest quarter, MNST generated $422 million in free cash flow, good enough for a solid 28% Y/Y increase. As we can see in the chart below, the company’s free cash flow has recovered from 2022 lows.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMonster’s earnings are forecasted to take a hit in its current fiscal year (FY22), with estimates indicating an 11% Y/Y decrease. Still, growth resumes in FY23, with estimates calling for 30% Y/Y earnings growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSEI InvestmentsSEI Investments is a leading global provider of asset management, investment processing, and investment operations solutions. SEIC is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).For those with an appetite for income, SEIC has that covered; the company’s annual dividend currently yields 1.4%.While the current yield is below its Zacks Finance sector average, SEIC’s 7% five-year annualized dividend growth rate picks up the slack in a big way.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company snapped a streak of mixed earnings results in its latest release, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 11% and penciling in a 2.6% sales surprise.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPaychex Inc.Paychex is a recognized leader in the payroll, human resource, and benefits outsourcing industry. PAYX’s earnings outlook has drifted higher over the last several months, pushing it into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike SEIC, Paychex rewards its shareholders; its annual dividend currently yields a solid 2.6%, well above its Zacks Business Services sector average of 0.9%.Impressively, the company’s payout has grown by nearly 8% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd to top it off, PAYX carries a favorable growth profile, with earnings forecasted to climb 13% in FY23 and a further 8% in FY24.The projected earnings growth comes on top of estimated Y/Y revenue upticks of 8.2% and 6% in FY23 and FY24, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineFor those with a more conservative approach, targeting companies with little to no debt is an excellent initial screen when searching for potential investments.After all, nobody wants to see a company they own become bogged down with obligations, negatively impacting other business areas.And all three stocks above – Monster Beverage Corp.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.2%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.14%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.39%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the coffee chain had gained 9.08% over the past month. This has outpaced the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 8.12% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.01% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Starbucks as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Starbucks to post earnings of $0.76 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 5.56%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $8.8 billion, up 9.29% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.42 per share and revenue of $36 billion. These totals would mark changes of +15.54% and +11.61%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Starbucks should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.1% higher.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.2% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.14%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.39%.Heading into today, shares of the agribusiness giant had lost 4.59% over the past month, lagging the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 1.27% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.01% in that time.Archer Daniels Midland will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 26, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Archer Daniels Midland to post earnings of $1.55 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 3.33%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $26.58 billion, up 15.1% from the year-ago period.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Archer Daniels Midland.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this agribusiness giant have returned -4.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4% change. The Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, to which ADM belongs, has lost 3.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.ADM is expected to post earnings of $1.55 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.41 points to a change of +42.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.31 indicates a change of -14.7% from what ADM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ADM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ADM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For ADM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $26.58 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $102.19 billion and $100.01 billion estimates indicate +19.9% and -2.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryADM reported revenues of $24.68 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.4%. EPS of $1.86 for the same period compares with $0.97 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.75%. The EPS surprise was +30.99%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.ADM is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ADM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Usually, the basic formula for retirement plays focuses on fiscal stability, reliable growth, and passive income. Unfortunately, the best enterprise that meets these attributes tends to be pricey.To mitigate this situation, you can instead target cheap retirement stocks to buy. And by cheap, we’re not talking about securities that are priced “low” for their own sake. Rather, these enterprises may be overlooked for whatever reason. But if you’re willing to step a bit outside your comfort zone, these ideas could be intriguing.So, if you want to skip the line on that senior discount, these are the cheap retirement stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$88.40HRLHormel Foods$46.10VALEVale$18.43PSXPhillips 66$103.03MCSMarcus$15.47NUENucor$157.56IBMInternational Business Machines$145.89Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)Coins stacked next to a calculator that says ""retirement plan."" Retirement stocks.Source: kenary820 / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) is a multinational food processing and commodities trading corporation. Commanding a critical service, ADM fundamentally makes for one of the cheap retirement stocks to buy. Sure enough, it represented a top performer in 2022. In the trailing year, shares gained over 23% of equity value.Not surprisingly, Archer Daniels Midland enjoys support from the analyst community. Wall Street experts rate ADM as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target hits $107.25, implying a nearly 23% upside from the time of writing. As well, the company carries a forward yield of 1.83%, which sits just under the consumer staples sector average of 1.89%.Financially, ADM makes ranks among the cheap retirement stocks to buy because of its undervalued profile. Right now, the market prices shares of ADM at 12 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector average stands at 17.3 times. Moreover, ADM enjoys strong business quality based on its well above-average return on equity of 17.6%.Story continuesHormel Foods (HRL)retirement stocks: a roadsign that says ""retirement ahead"". retirement stocksSource: ShutterstockCalling Austin, Minnesota, home Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) is a food-processing specialist. It features a long history, founded in 1891. One of the attributes bolstering Hormel is demand inelasticity. Irrespective of pricing fluctuations due to economic conditions, people must eat. And that bodes well for HRL, making it one of the cheap retirement stocks to buy.To be fair, HRL dipped 6% in the trailing year. Nevertheless, analysts remain undeterred, pegging Hormel as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target is $50.33, implying a potential upside of slightly over 8%. As well, the company carries a forward yield of 2.36%, again beating out the consumer staples sector’s average 1.89% yield.Based on traditional financial metrics, Hormel provides an intriguing look for cheap retirement stocks. For instance, its Altman Z-Score hit 4.9, reflecting stability in its finances. Plus, the food enterprise enjoys strong profitability metrics. Finally, based on Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value, HRL rates as modestly undervalued.Vale (VALE)retirement stocks an older couple sitting on a dock and looking at a pamphletSource: ShutterstockAlthough metals and mining firms don’t usually make the list of cheap retirement stocks to buy, people should arguably make an exception for Vale (NYSE:VALE). Based in Brazil, Vale is the largest producer of iron ore and nickel in the world, per its corporate profile. The latter commodity presents significant implications because of its integration into electric vehicle batteries.Certainly, the “ifs” and “when” of EV integration spark much debate. However, what’s not debatable are the facts. For example, in the trailing year, shares gained slightly over 20%. Another fact is that at the moment, all six covering analysts rate VALE as a consensus strong buy. For full disclosure, because of the stock’s dramatic upswing, it’s already met its prior price target.Moving forward, Vale offers an intriguing idea among cheap retirement stocks. Its forward yield of 3.2% beats out the materials sector average of 2.8%. Also, the market prices VALE at 7.7 times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median stands at 13.85 times.Phillips 66 (PSX)retirement stocks: miniature figurines climb a staircase made of coinsSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, energy giant Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) likely presents ongoing relevance because of its downstream enterprise. Specializing in the segment involving refining and marketing, Phillips 66 may benefit from ongoing social normalization trends. In particular, with high-profile companies demanding that their workers return to the office, traffic levels should increase. That should make PSX one of the lucrative cheap retirement stocks to buy.Presently, covering analysts rate PSX as a consensus moderate buy. Though PSX already gained 18.5% in the trailing year, analysts anticipate shares hitting $122.42. This average target implies an upside potential of 19%. Further, on the passive income side, Phillips 66 offers a forward yield of 3.77%. It’s generous though admittedly a bit under the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%.Just as well, PSX objectively rates as one of the cheap retirement stocks to buy. Right now, the market prices shares of PSX at 4.7 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median stands at 8.2 times.Marcus (MCS)a financial planner showing a couple a piece of paperSource: ShutterstockOne of the cheap retirement stocks to buy that also flies well under the radar, Marcus (NYSE:MCS) is an enterprise with two principal divisions: Marcus Theatres and Marcus Hotels and Resorts. Personally, I’m interested in the former. Because Marcus provides box office-based entertainment to more rural regions – you know, the places where millennials moved to because of cost-of-living reasons – MCS could be a surprise hit.Granted, on paper, it doesn’t seem that way. In the trailing year, MCS gave up 11.5% of equity value. However, covering analysts rate Marcus as a consensus strong buy. Also, they anticipate a recovery, targeting an average price forecast of $21. This implies an upside of almost 36%. To be fair, though, it’s not a perfect play among cheap retirement stocks to buy. For instance, its forward yield sits at a paltry 1.29%.Adding to the concerns, it’s not as if the box office represents a bastion of confidence as it is. However, the company’s earnings performance trend gradually improved from the abyss of the coronavirus pandemic. If you have many years before retirement, Marcus could be worth it on its long-term recovery potential.Nucor (NUE)an elderly couple jumping up in a white household. Cheap retirement stocksSource: ShutterstockAn American producer of steel and related products, Nucor (NYSE:NUE) incurred a choppy ride throughout 2022. However, the net picture overall has been resoundingly positive. In the trailing year, NUE gained a remarkable 38% in equity value. For context, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index slipped 14.5% during the same period.Despite its outperformance, NUE still ranks among the cheap retirement stocks to buy for those thinking long-term. For instance, the Biden administration’s initiatives to boost American infrastructure across the board should generally benefit NUE. As a small bonus, NUE carries a forward yield of 1.31%.Still, for full disclosure, analysts apparently believe that most of the good news has been baked in. At the time of writing, NUE features a consensus view of hold. It also has an average negative price target of 8.6%.Nevertheless, it’s difficult to ignore the value, especially if you’re thinking long-term. Currently, the market prices shares of NUE at 4.9 times trailing earnings, below the sector median of 8.15 times. Also, Nucar enjoys a strong balance sheet and excellent profitability metrics.IBM (IBM)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comFor many years, legacy tech giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) represented an afterthought in the digital innovation space. While its peers pushed into sectors such as cloud computing, IBM still had exposure to legacy hardware businesses. However, that’s a chapter in the past. Today, Big Blue embraces myriad innovations, not only including hybrid cloud initiatives but also the blockchain.Another reason to consider IBM is that it makes for a great idea among cheap retirement stocks to buy. Presently, the iconic firm offers a forward yield of 4.53%. That’s a stout source of passive income. As well, IBM enjoys 29 years of consecutive dividend increases. Don’t expect management to give up on this status, even with the high 66% payout ratio.Now, according to Gurufocus.com, the tech giant rates as fairly valued. Nevertheless, I believe it’s one of the cheap retirement stocks to buy now. For one thing, it has a forward PE of 15.1 times, well below the industry median of 24.4. As well, its price-to-projected-free-cash-flow ratio is 1.04 times, below the median of 1.57 times.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

MNST, SEI Investments SEIC, and Paychex PAYX – could all be considered.Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three stocks over the last year, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a closer look at each one.Monster Beverage Corp. Monster Beverage is a marketer and distributor of energy drinks and other alternative beverages. Currently, the company sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In its latest quarter, MNST generated $422 million in free cash flow, good enough for a solid 28% Y/Y increase. As we can see in the chart below, the company’s free cash flow has recovered from 2022 lows.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMonster’s earnings are forecasted to take a hit in its current fiscal year (FY22), with estimates indicating an 11% Y/Y decrease. Still, growth resumes in FY23, with estimates calling for 30% Y/Y earnings growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSEI InvestmentsSEI Investments is a leading global provider of asset management, investment processing, and investment operations solutions. SEIC is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).For those with an appetite for income, SEIC has that covered; the company’s annual dividend currently yields 1.4%.While the current yield is below its Zacks Finance sector average, SEIC’s 7% five-year annualized dividend growth rate picks up the slack in a big way.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company snapped a streak of mixed earnings results in its latest release, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 11% and penciling in a 2.6% sales surprise.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPaychex Inc.Paychex is a recognized leader in the payroll, human resource, and benefits outsourcing industry. PAYX’s earnings outlook has drifted higher over the last several months, pushing it into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike SEIC, Paychex rewards its shareholders; its annual dividend currently yields a solid 2.6%, well above its Zacks Business Services sector average of 0.9%.Impressively, the company’s payout has grown by nearly 8% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd to top it off, PAYX carries a favorable growth profile, with earnings forecasted to climb 13% in FY23 and a further 8% in FY24.The projected earnings growth comes on top of estimated Y/Y revenue upticks of 8.2% and 6% in FY23 and FY24, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineFor those with a more conservative approach, targeting companies with little to no debt is an excellent initial screen when searching for potential investments.After all, nobody wants to see a company they own become bogged down with obligations, negatively impacting other business areas.And all three stocks above – Monster Beverage Corp. MNST, SEI Investments SEIC, and Paychex PAYX – fit the criteria, carrying little to no debt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MO appears troubled by cost woes and soft volumes in the Smokeable Products segment. The impact of these downsides was witnessed in the third quarter of 2022, wherein net revenues fell 3.5% year over year to $6,550 million due to reduced revenues from the smokeable products segment, as well as the lack of revenues from the wine segment, which was divested in October 2021.Let’s delve deeper into the aspects that have been acting as hurdles for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company.What’s Not Working Well?In the third quarter of 2022, Altria’s Smokeable Products net revenues dipped 1.6% year over year to $5,882 million due to the reduced shipment volume and increased promotional investments. Domestic cigarette shipment volumes were down 9.2% year over year, mainly driven by the industry’s rate of decline and retail share losses, somewhat compensated by trade inventory movements. On adjusting for trade inventory movements and other factors, smokeable products’ domestic cigarette shipment volumes fell an estimated 8%.Within the smoke-free category, total estimated e-vapor volumes dropped 4% in the third quarter of 2022 due to regulatory uncertainty associated with JUUL. On its third-quarter earnings call, management stated that only a small fraction of e-vapor volumes had been authorized and no oral nicotine health products had been given market authorization.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCost inflation and increased gas prices were a headwind in the third quarter. Wage costs also increased. The persistence of these factors remains a concern. Management’s bottom-line view for 2022 considers planned investments associated with costs to improve the digital consumer engagement system, enhanced smoke-free product research, development and regulatory preparation expenses and marketplace activities to support the company’s smoke-free products. The view also includes anticipation of the inflation of Master Settlement Agreement expenses and direct and indirect material costs.The company continues assessing external environmental factors like increased inflation, higher interest rates, global supply-chain hurdles and ATC dynamics, such as purchasing patterns, the adoption of smoke-free products and disposable income. Apart from this, cigarette shipment volumes have generally been affected by anti-tobacco campaigns and increased consumer awareness regarding the harmful impacts of tobacco consumption. Regulatory hurdles are also a vital factor limiting the marketing of cigarettes, thereby affecting sales volume.Story continuesWrapping UpWhile strong pricing power and focus on expanding Oral Tobacco Products bodes well, we cannot ignore the abovementioned headwinds, at least in the near term. Shares of Altria have climbed 1.9% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 9.4%.Better Consumer Staple Stocks to GrabSome better-ranked stocks are Inter Parfums IPAR, Philip Morris PM and e.l.f.

99,89bd0880-1b22-3254-ad0b-c42b7798f5ec,HCA,2023-01-18,Investors Should Watch These 4 Hospital Stocks Despite Headwinds,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-watch-4-hospital-stocks-134601937.html,1673963161,STORY,"['HCA', 'THC', 'UHS', 'ACHC', '^GSPC']","[The operating environment for hospital companies is improving with increasing non-Covid utilization, outpatient surgeries and patient days. Staffing challenges are expected to decrease this year. However, recession fears, inflation and resultant escalating costs are eating up Zacks Medical-Hospital industry players’ margins. Growing competition in this market remains a common theme. Technological innovations and adoptions are expected to continue boosting hospital companies’ efficiency and generating cost savings. Leading industry players like HCA Healthcare Inc. HCA, Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. ACHC and Tenet Healthcare Corporation THC are set to benefit from these developments.About the Industry The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry comprises for-profit hospital companies that provide healthcare through different types of hospitals, such as acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric. These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care and diagnostic and emergency services. Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.4 Key Trends to Watch in the Hospital IndustryImproving Volumes: Going ahead, non-COVID admissions are expected to continue rising as the intensity of COVID-related utilization of resources declines. Demand for elective procedures is expected to drive patient volumes. Growth in admissions, outpatient surgeries and Medicare reimbursements and deferred procedures can support hospital companies' revenues. However, inflationary pressures and financial constraints can force patients to delay addressing some non-emergency medical needs. The benefits of the Affordable Care Act and similar safety nets can provide customers with some respite, which can help patients navigate tough times.Story continuesIncreasing Expenses: With rising patient volumes, operating costs are bound to go up. High salaries, wages and benefits and increasing costs of hospital supplies due to inflation will likely reduce margins. Also, growth-project investments will keep expenses elevated, putting pressure on the bottom line. Even though labor shortages are expected to keep creating headaches for the industry players, the situation is expected to improve in the coming days. Moreover, renegotiating contracts with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Growth in the Elderly Population: Steady advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare enable the senior population to witness constant growth. This can result in rising demand for hospital services in the long term. The U.S. Census Bureau’s revised report suggests that individuals above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the country’s population, reflecting a climb from 17% in 2020 to 21% in 2030. This demographic change and the rising incidence of diseases will likely be industry drivers. Plus, the increasing number of people signing up for healthcare plans through the Affordable Care Act indicates fewer challenges to visiting hospitals in the future.Technological Improvements: Technological innovations, improvements and wider adoption will continue to be a major theme in the hospital space. The trend should optimize hospital services, minimize unnecessary expenses and enhance the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which will likely rise in the future. The industry players are leveraging AI and automation along with real-time analytics to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis that hospitals utilize. The companies are using the virtual health domain to heighten their efficiency by limiting the patients’ waiting time and trimming their treatment costs.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish OutlookThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #216, which places it in the bottom 14% of nearly 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have declined 19.1% in the past year. Given the lackluster near-term prospects, companies in the space are expected to take a hit.Before we present the stocks that you may want to watch, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; Sector The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry has fared better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its broader sector over the past year. During this time period, the stocks in this industry have declined 0.5% compared with the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 14.1% and the Zacks Medical sector’s decrease of 10.4%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing hospital stocks, the industry trades at 8.21X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 12.09X and the sector’s 8.37X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 8.75X, as low as 5.57X and at a median of 7.76X as the charts below show.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past 5 Years)4 Stocks to Watch ForWe are presenting four stocks with a Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold) from the Medical-Hospital industry.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. HCA Healthcare: The company provides services via surgery centers, free-standing emergency rooms, physician clinics and urgent care centers. HCA’s inorganic growth strategies enable it to persistently increase patient volumes, expand its network across several markets and add more hospitals in its portfolio.

HCA Healthcare also focuses on boosting shareholders’ value with dividend hikes and buybacks.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HCA Healthcare’s 2023 EPS indicates 7.2% year-over-year growth.

HCA beat earnings estimates twice in the past four quarters and missed on two occasions, the average surprise being 2.3%. Shares of the company have jumped 8.4% in the past month.Price &amp; Consensus: HCAUniversal Health Services: The company focuses on behavioral indications like autism, eating disorders, sexual trauma and disorderliness in the military through its patriot support program. This segment holds immense scope for growth in the days ahead, considering the dire need to address behavioral health issues triggered by the pandemic. UHS’ plans to add new capacities in hospitals in important markets of Texas and California to address strong acute care demand are expected to be major tailwinds. It has a strong share buyback plan in place to boost shareholder value.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Universal Health’s 2023 bottom line indicates 8.7% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for its revenues in 2023 signals 4.4% increase from a year ago.

PPG is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results after the closing bell on Jan 19.The company surpassed Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters while missing it once. It delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of around 7.8% on average. It posted a negative earnings surprise of 0.6% in the last reported quarter.The company is expected to have faced demand headwinds in Europe and China, raw material cost inflation and supply-chain disruptions in the fourth quarter. However, a recovery in the automotive OEM and aerospace coatings business, pricing actions and restructuring cost savings might have supported its margins in the fourth quarter.PPG Industries shares are down 19.2% over the past year against 0.2% rise recorded by its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks ModelOur proven model predicts earnings beat for PPG Industries this season.

Also, the consensus estimate for net sales for PPG’s Performance Coatings segment stands at $2,373 million, which suggests a year-over-year decrease of 5.3%.Some Factors to WatchA recovery in the automotive OEM and aerospace coatings and stable demand in automotive refinish and traffic solutions businesses are likely to have aided the company’s performance in the fourth quarter.Story continuesPPG Industries is expected to have benefited from its actions to raise selling prices in an effort to counter inflation. Moreover, the company is taking additional cost reduction actions amounting to roughly $70 million, some benefits of which are expected in the fourth quarter.PPG is also expected to have seen lower working capital in the fourth quarter compared than the previous quarter as it is likely to have benefited from inventory reductions, leading to cash generation in the quarter to be reported.However, the company is expected to have faced headwinds from higher raw material, energy and logistics costs in the fourth-quarter which might have dented in its margins. PPG expects raw material cost inflation of mid-single digit percentage in the fourth quarter. Tightened supply and pandemic-related shut downs in China are expected to have adversely impacted its performance in the fourth quarter. Demand weakness in Europe and China is likely to have continued in fourth quarter due to weaker industrial productions, hurting PPG’s sales volumes. The company expects total sales volume to be in mid-single digit percentage on a year-over-year basis in the quarter.PPG Industries is also likely to have faced headwinds from unfavorable currency translation in the quarter to be reported, stemming from a strong appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus many foreign currencies. PPG Industries, Inc.

""We didn't execute perfectly on some so we've taken a hard look at those, and you make adjustments.""LOW BARUBS analysts wrote in a note Morgan Stanley's fourth-quarter core trends were encouraging and cleared the low bar.Revenue from Morgan Stanley's investment banking business fell 49% to $1.25 billion in the fourth quarter, with revenue declines across the bank's advisory, equity and fixed income segments.The investment banking business slowdown weighed on the company's net revenue, pulling it down 12% to $12.7 billion.""I am highly confident that when the Fed pauses, deal activity and underwriting activity will go up,"" Chief Executive Officer James Gorman told analysts in a call.Still, Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that the bank is comfortable with its headcount after recent layoffs. Morgan Stanley had cut 2% of its headcount in December, or about 1,600 jobs, a source had told Reuters.Trading has been a surprise bright spot for Morgan Stanley, with the unit's revenue jumping 26% in the fourth quarter, as clients look to hedge against market risks by rejiggering portfolios toward more defensive assets.Looking ahead, Gorman said the bank's wealth and investment management businesses are expected to become an increasingly larger portion of the firm's pre-tax profit in the coming years.The wealth management unit has also helped the bank keep its funding cost lower amid a rate hiking cycle, the CEO added.Mark-to-market losses on corporate loans came in at $876 million, as interest rates rose. It includes debt to Twitter, the CFO said. Morgan Stanley is among a group of banks that provided a $13 billion loan to finance Elon Musk's acquisition of the social media company.Updating Morgan Stanley's outlook, the CFO said the bank's net interest income, or the money banks bring in from interest payments, has not peaked, although it is likely to reduce its growth rate this year.

After a big release of data last week including inflation, jobless claims, and consumer sentiment the market can now look forward to earnings. With many strong opinions on Wall Street about future economic growth, these reports can bring some much-needed insight on what to expect for this year.Goldman Sachs and Morgan StanleyFirst out of the gate Tuesday morning were the big investment banks. Goldman Sachs GS missed, reporting quarterly earnings of $3.32 per share, when Zacks Consensus Estimate was $5.25 per share. Goldman said its Q4 profits dropped to $1.19 billion, from $3.81 billion in Q4 2021. Revenue for Q4 dropped to $10.59 billion from $12.64 billion in the year earlier quarter. Expectation for revenue was $10.8 billion. EPS missed by -42% and revenue missed by -2.8%.This was a very disappointing earnings report for the bank and demonstrates a clear slowdown in business. It should be noted that Zacks research could have helped avoid GS stock. Goldman Sachs currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating a lack of earnings growth momentum. Zacks had also been consistently revising estimates lower for GS over the last 90 days. Additionally, using Zacks Style Scores, GS holds an F in Value, Growth, and Momentum.Goldman Sachs laid off 3,200 people over the last few weeks, likely to address these painful financial results. GS shares are down 2.5% in premarket trading.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMorgan Stanley MS fared better than Goldman. Earnings of $1.31 per share or $2.1 billion, beating the Zacks estimate of $1.25 per share. This was a worse result than Q4 2021 though, which showed earnings of $3.6 billion or $2.01 per share. Q4 Revenue came in at $12.8 billion, narrowly beating the estimate of $12.6 billion.Interactive Brokers and Charles Schwab Large retail brokerage houses also report this week too. Interactive Brokers was one of few stocks that performed well in 2022, finishing the year unchanged. IBKR is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock with very strong earnings and sales growth estimates.Story continuesQ4 Zacks Consensus Sales estimates call for 53% YoY growth to $926 million, and FY 2022 sales are estimated to climb 22% to $3.2 billion. Q4 earnings estimates are $1.16 per share, growing 40% YoY, and FY 2022 earnings are projected to be up 16.4% at $3.93 per share. IBKR reports earnings on Tuesday after the close.Charles Schwab SCHW, another broker and financial services business, will be reporting earnings Wednesday, January 18 before the market opens. Like IBRK, SCHW outperformed the market in 2022 as the stock was down only marginally.The Zacks Rank doesn’t consider SCHW as favorably as IBKR and currently scores it a #3 (Hold) indicating slow to no upward earnings growth trend. Q4 sales are expected to grow 18% to $5.5 billion, while FY2022 sales are expected to climb 12.5% to $21billion. Q4 earnings are projected to increase by 28% to $1.10 per share and FY 2022 earnings expected to increase by 21% to $3.93 per share.Considering the slowing of speculative action, and the generally painful environment of the stock market in 2022 it will be very informative to see how the brokers’ earnings fared. Although there was far less hype in the market, I wouldn’t be surprised if retail investors are more active in down years to try and stem losses.Big Earnings CallsThursday will bring a couple big reports as well, including Procter and Gamble PG, and Netflix NFLX.Netflix, which had a stunning rally off its lows in the second half of 2022 has a highly anticipated report coming out. After reporting the first subscriber decline in a decade during their Q2 earnings, it appears that growth is back on track. NFLX is projecting an extremely high growth quarter expecting 4.5 million new paid subscribers.NFLX has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), given its lack of positive earnings revisions trend. Q4 sales growth is projected at 1.67% or $7.8 billion, and FY sales are expected to grow 6.4% to $31.6 billion. Earnings expectations for Q4 are expected to shrink -66% to $0.45 per share, and -8.3% to $10.31 per share for FY 2022.Below you can also see that Q4 estimates have halved over the last 90 days, demonstrating lowered expectations for the company.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnother important earnings report will be coming from Procter and Gamble on Thursday before the market opens. PG currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and its Zacks Sector Rank is in the top 25%.Q4 estimates for PG have sales marginally lower -1.7% to $20.6 billion, with earnings expected to shrink as well by 4.8% to $1.58 per share. Procter and Gamble report annual numbers during the Q2 reporting period.While PG has tremendous leeway in pricing its products considering its standing as a consumer staples power, it will be interesting to see how commodity inflation, and freight cost may have affected the bottom line. Considering projections, it appears they are not expecting a great year looking forward in those regards.Getting StartedThis earnings season is just getting started and the next few weeks will provide a lot of valuable information on how the economy performed in the last quarter of 2022. The broad market and economy are at something of a precipice, as investors are now expecting a ‘soft landing’. Whether or not that will be the case, only time will tell, but getting into the minutiae of these reports will help inform investors about how close a recession may be, or where we can expect prices to go. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

First, we got to take note of the moves that we saw in Goldman Sachs, and also what we saw in Morgan Stanley. I mentioned the fact that the Dow was off 391 points. A lot of that had to do with underperformance that we saw in Goldman with that stock closing off about 6 and 1/2%. The drop there coming after the company missed on earnings on both the top and bottom lines, posted a profit drop of just about 70%.And comparing that with what we heard from Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley numbers were actually relatively strong, especially when you're comparing it to what we saw, more broadly speaking, across that sector. But Morgan Stanley beating on both the top and bottom line. Record wealth management revenue, that sent shares up nearly 6% today.They also posted some growth at their trading business. CEO James Gorman saying that he is more confident that deal-making is going to come back around once the Fed does, in fact, pause its rate hikes. And that's a big contributing factor to some of the gains that we're seeing in Morgan Stanley today there, Dave.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, really the only optimistic tone we heard from a big bank CEO, and largely because wealth management. But again, they, like everybody else, struggle with investment banking, which is essentially down about 50% for all the big banks, which drove Goldman Sachs to that disastrous report, profits down about 70%. So, yeah, Morgan Stanley really dragging the Dow down-- up and Goldman Sachs driving it right back down.What's the real theme? Investment banking is going to struggle. Set aside a billion dollars, and everybody set aside hundreds of millions, if not more, for future loan losses. Really, the two themes that have emerged, with everyone predicting a mild recession ahead, is really the bank story.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly, it is. And I think you have to really just-- it begs the question as to how bad it's going to get. And if you compare some of the commentary, at least for Jamie Dimon now saying we're expecting a mild recession, that's a huge step down from the hurricane that he had predicted just about a year ago. So maybe things aren't going to be as bad as some investors had been bracing for. But I think we can really bet on a slowing-- slowing growth, slower growth environment going forward.DAVID BRIGGS: Jamie Dimon's never going to outrun the hurricane, is he?SEANA SMITH: I don't know.DAVID BRIGGS: You think 10 years from now, we're still talking about the hurricane?SEANA SMITH: I hope not. I hope something else happens between now and then. But at least--DAVID BRIGGS: He's accomplished an awful lot. But that is every time--SEANA SMITH: And he walked it back. To be fair, he did kind of walk it back, put it more in context. But really, that hurricane headline grabbed a lot of headlines.DAVID BRIGGS: It's a tombstone headline. All right, let's talk about Alibaba, shares falling on the first day of trading since famed meme stock leader Ryan Cohen bought shares in the Chinese e-commerce giant. Baba shares sinking as a slew of warning signs come out of China, including declining population and shrinking GDP growth. It is interesting when you look at some of the big losers on the NASDAQ on the day, Baidu, JD.com, Pinduoduo, three of the biggest four losers on the NASDAQ.But back to Ryan Cohen and his move here with Alibaba. Look, likely to be unsuccessful. This is not a meme stock. This is not anything like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond or GameStop for the obvious reason that you're dealing with the Chinese government here.You're not just talking about investors. You're not talking about our markets. You're talking about one thing you cannot control is the Chinese government, who is obviously a stakeholder and has really clamped down on the Chinese tech sector. Even if that's loosening, they ultimately have the word here, the last word. And I don't think Ryan Cohen is likely to overcome that.SEANA SMITH: No. I don't think he's going to have the outsize impact that he has had on some of the other companies. And also not to mention Alibaba is a stock that has a $300 billion market cap. So just given the sheer--DAVID BRIGGS: Right.SEANA SMITH: --size of it--DAVID BRIGGS: Right.SEANA SMITH: --you have to question about how much outsize impact he's going to have. He does seem to be that he will be pushing for more buybacks from Alibaba. But of course, we will see how all this plays out.DAVID BRIGGS: Does he just want more retail traders to get involved with the stock? Is that ultimately the goal? He knows what he cannot accomplish here. He knows how small that is in terms of their overall market cap.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and it seems to be, at least taking a look at the reaction from the Street so far, he could get more overseas investors interested in Alibaba again, which, in fact, if he does do that, that, of course, would be a positive here for the stock. He is a high-profile investor. We know he does have a very core following here. So it could add some positive sentiment here to Alibaba, which has been down pretty substantially over the last two years.All right, let's get to a big winner here and that is Roblox, the stock closing up nearly 12%, leading the NASDAQ higher. The driver is solid bookings update here from the company, Roblox estimating that bookings of up to 450 million for December. That beat the Street's expectations. It's important to point out that shares have actually been down over 50% in the past year.And this company is going to stop reporting its monthly numbers this spring. But given the outsized impact that these numbers are having on the stock today, certainly worth it to mention it, daily active users in December jumping 18% year-over-year to 61 and 1/2 million, hours engaged, Dave, almost 5 billion. Impressive numbers here from Roblox. And we're seeing that reflected in the stock move today.DAVID BRIGGS: Yeah, look, it is a solid, solid number to come out. Can you bet on this long term? It doesn't fit any of the patterns that we've seen in gaming. It doesn't look sustainable when you look at the overall market.It looks like largely something we saw in the short term. But you've got to look at a company that was at, what, $80 in December '21. So it's-- all the positive was really taken out of it. Now-- now there's some upside. I don't believe this is sustainable, but we shall see.]"

In contrast, the “deal stocks” should benefit from higher rates, reduced VC investment, and easing competitive threats.While each deal stock is trading at discounted multiples, the analyst found GPN particularly compelling.The analyst thinks GPN’s higher merchant exposure could outgrow the banking businesses at FIS and Fiserv, Inc (NASDAQ: FISV).The analyst is also optimistic about GPN’s strategic focus on M&amp;A, which can help it defend against the longer-term threat of share loss.Price Action: GPN shares traded higher by 3.33% at $111.24 on the last check Tuesday.Latest Ratings for GPNDateFirmActionFromToFeb 2022Morgan StanleyMaintainsEqual-WeightFeb 2022RosenblattMaintainsBuyFeb 2022Raymond JamesMaintainsOutperformView More Analyst Ratings for GPNView the Latest Analyst RatingsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

American International Group (AIG) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Finance peers, we might be able to answer that question.American International Group is a member of our Finance group, which includes 871 different companies and currently sits at #11 in the Zacks Sector Rank.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.American International Group (AIG) is a stock many investors are watching right now. AIG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value.AIG is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.05. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. AIG's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.63. AIG's PEG has been as high as 1.47 and as low as 0.84, with a median of 1.04, all within the past year.We should also highlight that AIG has a P/B ratio of 1.18. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 3.08. Over the past 12 months, AIG's P/B has been as high as 1.18 and as low as 0.66, with a median of 0.87.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. AIG has a P/S ratio of 0.81. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.85.Story continuesAnother great Insurance - Multi line stock you could consider is Prudential Financial (PRU), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Shares of Prudential Financial currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 8.27, and its PEG ratio is 0.99. In comparison, its industry sports average P/E and PEG ratios of 9.86 and 1.63.Over the last 12 months, PRU's P/E has been as high as 10.48, as low as 7.31, with a median of 8.69, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.13, as low as 0.81, with a median of 0.96.Prudential Financial also has a P/B ratio of 2.19 compared to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 3.08. Over the past year, its P/B ratio has been as high as 2.39, as low as 0.62, with a median of 1.20.These are only a few of the key metrics included in American International Group and Prudential Financial strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock.

114,81c6c6c0-f2c0-3f84-9cb2-387752d2a7af,HOLX,2023-01-18,What's in Store for Abbott Laboratories (ABT) in Q4 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-store-abbott-laboratories-abt-134301019.html,1673962981,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Abbott Laboratories ABT is slated to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 25, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 26.37%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all the occasions, the average beat being 21.78%.Let's see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayStubborn inflationary pressure, record strengthening of the U.S. dollar and supply chain issues in certain areas of business, most notably, in Electrophysiology are expected to have adversely impacted Abbott’s overall fourth-quarter performance. Going by the industry-wide trend so far, logistical challenges and increasing unit cost might have weighed on corporate profitability of the company. Not just this, the existing healthcare staffing challenges and diminishing demand for COVID-testing products may also have weighed on the company through the Q4 months. The lockdown issues in limited geographies, including China where the company has extensive base, are expected to have also impacted business during the fourth quarter.On a positive note, within Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD), the company has been witnessing visible signs of a rebound, reflecting sequential improvement based on its stable business model. New product launches across key markets have been majorly boosting the EPD business in recent months. The fourth-quarter performance is likely to have been driven by growing customer demand for core therapeutic lines, including cardiometabolic, respiratory and central nervous system/pain management.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS SurpriseAbbott Laboratories Price and EPS SurpriseAbbott Laboratories price-eps-surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuoteIn Diagnostics, we expect the company to report a year-over-year decline in COVID test sales due to lower demand for laboratory-based tests. However, the company might have registered growth in rapid tests, which include BinaxNOW, Panbio and ID NOW, in Q4. According to the company, with the emergence of new viruses that escape immunity, rapid tests have become the best tool to help slow and prevent transmission.Story continuesExcluding COVID testing revenues, sales of routine diagnostic tests are expected to have improved in Q4 on the continuous rollout of Alinity, Abbott’s suite of diagnostic instruments, as well as expanding menus across the company’s testing platforms of immunoassay, clinical chemistry and molecular testing.Abbott’s other consumer-facing businesses, which include diabetes care, have been catching up, backed by new product instructions. In the United States, the company initiated the full launch of Libre 3, which automatically delivers minute glucose readings with accuracy, courtesy of the world’s smallest and thinnest wearable sensor. This is likely to have majorly contributed to the company's fourth-quarter performance. In this regard, we note that Abbott has been in the limelight for developments in its flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system, widely known as the FreeStyle Libre System.However, internationally, sales growth is expected to have been impacted by a couple of transitory items, including supply constraints on Libre 1 in certain emerging markets. Further, a strategic choice that the company made in Germany to rapidly transition its large existing user base to the latest generation Libre 3 system might have temporarily reduced Abbott’s focus on new user additions during the fourth quarter in this region.Within Nutrition, total worldwide Nutrition and Pediatric Nutrition sales are expected to have declined in Q4, thanks to the voluntary recall and manufacturing shutdown of certain infant formula products being manufactured at one of Abbott's U.S. plants since last February. These include the company’s market-leading Similac and Elecare.Though the company announced an update on the resumption of production at the Sturgis, MI facility, starting with the specialty formula EleCare and metabolic formulas, business recovery might take some more time. Per the last update, the company, in September, began production of several Similac products. Although Similac sales are expected to have been similar in the fourth-quarter months, a full-fledged business rebound might take longer.EstimatesFor fourth-quarter 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $9.48 billion indicates a 17.4% decline from the prior-year comparable quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 90 cents, suggesting a 31.8% decline year on year.Earnings WhispersPer our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a higher chance of beating estimates.

HOLX is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Feb 1, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of 82 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 32.3%. Its earnings surpassed the consensus estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 46.08%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the announcement.Factors at PlayDiagnosticsIn the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Hologic is expected to have witnessed strong growth in the Diagnostics business (excluding COVID) from the growing adoption of Panther instruments and an expanded Panther installed base. During the fourth-quarter earnings update, Hologic noted that the company has nearly 3,250 Panthers instruments placed globally. Its performance might have been driven by both legacy and new assays, namely the BBCVTV vaginitis panel, MGen, CTMG and its respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion.However, with COVID testing significantly down over the past few months, Hologic’s Molecular Diagnostics business is likely to have been impacted by lower COVID-related sales.Our model shows a 48.8% year-over-year decline in total Diagnostics revenues in the first quarter of 2023.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total Diagnostics’ first-quarter revenues is pegged at $482 million, suggesting a decline of 49.3% from year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Breast HealthIn recent months, the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage has aggravated due to persistent supply chain issues and the current geopolitical environment. This is likely to have impacted Hologic’s Breast Health business as it did in the prior-reported fiscal fourth quarter.In November 2022, Hologic announced that the 3Dimensions mammography system was awarded EUREF Type Test certification by the European Reference Organisation for Quality Assured Breast Screening and Diagnostic Services. It is the first digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) system to receive such a distinction and one of only nine mammography systems overall to earn certification. The development is likely to have benefited Hologic’s Breast Health business in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesHologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Hologic, Inc.

Quote Our model shows a 12.7% year-over-year decline in Breast Health revenues in the first quarter 2023.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s first-quarter revenues is pegged at $316 million, suggesting a decline of 11.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.GYN SurgicalHologic’s GYN Surgical business arm is likely to have gained from an ongoing rebound in elective procedures with the full-fledged opening up of the economy as well as acceleration from new business lines. The business is expected to have benefited from its acquisitions of MyoSure Fluent as well as Bolder and Acessa. Further, similar to the fiscal fourth quarter, we anticipate strong contributions from Bolder's CoolSeal devices to have added to the top-line performance. Hologic’s robust surgical product offerings, including the NovaSure, MyoSure, Acessa laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation system and the Fluent fluid management system, are likely to have resulted in further gains for the business arm in Q1.Our model shows a 1.1% year-over-year decline in GYN Surgical revenues in the first quarter Of 2023.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s first-quarter revenues is pegged at $141 million, suggesting an increase of 5.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Estimate PictureThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total fiscal first-quarter revenues of $980.9 million suggests a decline of 33.3% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 88 cents, indicating a decline of 59.5% from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Hologic this time around.

In Ives' view, Apple is likely to show demand for its products is more resilient than investors are currently modeling.Story continuesApple CEO Tim Cook presents the new iPhone 14 at an Apple event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 7, 2022. REUTERS/Carlos BarriaLastly, after months of tech layoffs, hiring freezes and other cutting costs measures, big tech companies are poised to stabilize.In Ives’ opinion, these measures are viewed positively as, ""investors want these management teams to get ahead of the storm and preserve margins in this uncertain macro.""Looking ahead, Ives is forecasting another 5%-10% headcount cut across the tech sector as many of the issues currently weighing on the tech companies are unlikely to let up anytime soon.""We are forecasting another 5%-10% headcount cut across the tech sector as many of these companies (both big and small) were spending money like 1980's Rock Stars and now need to reign in the expense controls ahead of a softer macro,"" Ives said.Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Usually, the basic formula for retirement plays focuses on fiscal stability, reliable growth, and passive income. Unfortunately, the best enterprise that meets these attributes tends to be pricey.To mitigate this situation, you can instead target cheap retirement stocks to buy. And by cheap, we’re not talking about securities that are priced “low” for their own sake. Rather, these enterprises may be overlooked for whatever reason. But if you’re willing to step a bit outside your comfort zone, these ideas could be intriguing.So, if you want to skip the line on that senior discount, these are the cheap retirement stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$88.40HRLHormel Foods$46.10VALEVale$18.43PSXPhillips 66$103.03MCSMarcus$15.47NUENucor$157.56IBMInternational Business Machines$145.89Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)Coins stacked next to a calculator that says ""retirement plan."" Retirement stocks.Source: kenary820 / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) is a multinational food processing and commodities trading corporation. Commanding a critical service, ADM fundamentally makes for one of the cheap retirement stocks to buy. Sure enough, it represented a top performer in 2022. In the trailing year, shares gained over 23% of equity value.Not surprisingly, Archer Daniels Midland enjoys support from the analyst community. Wall Street experts rate ADM as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target hits $107.25, implying a nearly 23% upside from the time of writing. As well, the company carries a forward yield of 1.83%, which sits just under the consumer staples sector average of 1.89%.Financially, ADM makes ranks among the cheap retirement stocks to buy because of its undervalued profile. Right now, the market prices shares of ADM at 12 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector average stands at 17.3 times. Moreover, ADM enjoys strong business quality based on its well above-average return on equity of 17.6%.Story continuesHormel Foods (HRL)retirement stocks: a roadsign that says ""retirement ahead"". retirement stocksSource: ShutterstockCalling Austin, Minnesota, home Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) is a food-processing specialist. It features a long history, founded in 1891. One of the attributes bolstering Hormel is demand inelasticity. Irrespective of pricing fluctuations due to economic conditions, people must eat. And that bodes well for HRL, making it one of the cheap retirement stocks to buy.To be fair, HRL dipped 6% in the trailing year. Nevertheless, analysts remain undeterred, pegging Hormel as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target is $50.33, implying a potential upside of slightly over 8%. As well, the company carries a forward yield of 2.36%, again beating out the consumer staples sector’s average 1.89% yield.Based on traditional financial metrics, Hormel provides an intriguing look for cheap retirement stocks. For instance, its Altman Z-Score hit 4.9, reflecting stability in its finances. Plus, the food enterprise enjoys strong profitability metrics. Finally, based on Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value, HRL rates as modestly undervalued.Vale (VALE)retirement stocks an older couple sitting on a dock and looking at a pamphletSource: ShutterstockAlthough metals and mining firms don’t usually make the list of cheap retirement stocks to buy, people should arguably make an exception for Vale (NYSE:VALE). Based in Brazil, Vale is the largest producer of iron ore and nickel in the world, per its corporate profile. The latter commodity presents significant implications because of its integration into electric vehicle batteries.Certainly, the “ifs” and “when” of EV integration spark much debate. However, what’s not debatable are the facts. For example, in the trailing year, shares gained slightly over 20%. Another fact is that at the moment, all six covering analysts rate VALE as a consensus strong buy. For full disclosure, because of the stock’s dramatic upswing, it’s already met its prior price target.Moving forward, Vale offers an intriguing idea among cheap retirement stocks. Its forward yield of 3.2% beats out the materials sector average of 2.8%. Also, the market prices VALE at 7.7 times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median stands at 13.85 times.Phillips 66 (PSX)retirement stocks: miniature figurines climb a staircase made of coinsSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, energy giant Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) likely presents ongoing relevance because of its downstream enterprise. Specializing in the segment involving refining and marketing, Phillips 66 may benefit from ongoing social normalization trends. In particular, with high-profile companies demanding that their workers return to the office, traffic levels should increase. That should make PSX one of the lucrative cheap retirement stocks to buy.Presently, covering analysts rate PSX as a consensus moderate buy. Though PSX already gained 18.5% in the trailing year, analysts anticipate shares hitting $122.42. This average target implies an upside potential of 19%. Further, on the passive income side, Phillips 66 offers a forward yield of 3.77%. It’s generous though admittedly a bit under the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%.Just as well, PSX objectively rates as one of the cheap retirement stocks to buy. Right now, the market prices shares of PSX at 4.7 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median stands at 8.2 times.Marcus (MCS)a financial planner showing a couple a piece of paperSource: ShutterstockOne of the cheap retirement stocks to buy that also flies well under the radar, Marcus (NYSE:MCS) is an enterprise with two principal divisions: Marcus Theatres and Marcus Hotels and Resorts. Personally, I’m interested in the former. Because Marcus provides box office-based entertainment to more rural regions – you know, the places where millennials moved to because of cost-of-living reasons – MCS could be a surprise hit.Granted, on paper, it doesn’t seem that way. In the trailing year, MCS gave up 11.5% of equity value. However, covering analysts rate Marcus as a consensus strong buy. Also, they anticipate a recovery, targeting an average price forecast of $21. This implies an upside of almost 36%. To be fair, though, it’s not a perfect play among cheap retirement stocks to buy. For instance, its forward yield sits at a paltry 1.29%.Adding to the concerns, it’s not as if the box office represents a bastion of confidence as it is. However, the company’s earnings performance trend gradually improved from the abyss of the coronavirus pandemic. If you have many years before retirement, Marcus could be worth it on its long-term recovery potential.Nucor (NUE)an elderly couple jumping up in a white household. Cheap retirement stocksSource: ShutterstockAn American producer of steel and related products, Nucor (NYSE:NUE) incurred a choppy ride throughout 2022. However, the net picture overall has been resoundingly positive. In the trailing year, NUE gained a remarkable 38% in equity value. For context, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index slipped 14.5% during the same period.Despite its outperformance, NUE still ranks among the cheap retirement stocks to buy for those thinking long-term. For instance, the Biden administration’s initiatives to boost American infrastructure across the board should generally benefit NUE. As a small bonus, NUE carries a forward yield of 1.31%.Still, for full disclosure, analysts apparently believe that most of the good news has been baked in. At the time of writing, NUE features a consensus view of hold. It also has an average negative price target of 8.6%.Nevertheless, it’s difficult to ignore the value, especially if you’re thinking long-term. Currently, the market prices shares of NUE at 4.9 times trailing earnings, below the sector median of 8.15 times. Also, Nucar enjoys a strong balance sheet and excellent profitability metrics.IBM (IBM)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comFor many years, legacy tech giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) represented an afterthought in the digital innovation space. While its peers pushed into sectors such as cloud computing, IBM still had exposure to legacy hardware businesses. However, that’s a chapter in the past. Today, Big Blue embraces myriad innovations, not only including hybrid cloud initiatives but also the blockchain.Another reason to consider IBM is that it makes for a great idea among cheap retirement stocks to buy. Presently, the iconic firm offers a forward yield of 4.53%. That’s a stout source of passive income. As well, IBM enjoys 29 years of consecutive dividend increases. Don’t expect management to give up on this status, even with the high 66% payout ratio.Now, according to Gurufocus.com, the tech giant rates as fairly valued. Nevertheless, I believe it’s one of the cheap retirement stocks to buy now. For one thing, it has a forward PE of 15.1 times, well below the industry median of 24.4. As well, its price-to-projected-free-cash-flow ratio is 1.04 times, below the median of 1.57 times.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:TJX) insiders sold US$24m worth of stock, possibly signalling a downtrend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tjx-companies-inc-nyse-tjx-110059328.html,1674039659,STORY,['TJX'],"[The fact that multiple The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At TJX CompaniesIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Chairman, Carol Meyrowitz, sold US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$67.62 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$81.55). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 21% of Carol Meyrowitz's stake.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of TJX Companies shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At TJX Companies Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at TJX Companies. In total, insiders dumped US$5.5m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. TJX Companies insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$156m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The TJX Companies Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But it is good to see that TJX Companies is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for TJX Companies you should be aware of, and 1 of these is a bit concerning.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 8th of March to $2.13. This takes the dividend yield to 3.1%, which shareholders will be pleased with. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen Amgen's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Based on the last payment, Amgen was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 28.4%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 54% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendAmgen Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.44 total annually to $8.52. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 19% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, Amgen has only grown its earnings per share at 2.8% per annum over the past five years. Growth of 2.8% per annum is not particularly high, which might explain why the company is paying out a higher proportion of earnings. This isn't necessarily bad, but we wouldn't expect rapid dividend growth in the future.Amgen Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for Amgen that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

PSEG will continue to actively support offshore wind in New Jersey and the region,"" PSEG's Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer Lathrop Craig said.PSEG remains committed to Governor Murphy's clean energy policies and President Biden's goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.

European shares climbed after a string of positive earnings updates.Europe's STOXX 600 index rose to its highest level since April 2022.Three factors have propelled stock markets higher, Andreas Bruckner, european equity strategist at BofA Global Research, said.These were an expectation for a dovish pivot from the U.S. Federal Reserve, economic data that showed companies working overtime to deal with order backlogs, and China's economy re-opening faster than expected from COVID-19 lockdowns.""But the sugar high that markets are on will eventually disappear because it will be impossible to mask an underlying weakness in economic demand,"" said Bruckner.London's FTSE 100 scaled a fresh 4-1/2-year high after the latest UK inflation numbers, although worries over tight monetary policy remained as the rate hovered in double-digit territory.The internationally focused FTSE 100 edged 0.1% higher. The pan-European STOXX 600 was 0.2% higher, boosted by rate-sensitive technology stocks, while U.S. stock futures were mixed.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan rose 0.4%.JAPANThe market spotlight was also on Japan, where the yen slid and government bond yields fell the most in two decades at one point, retreating sharply from the central bank's 0.5% ceiling after policymakers decided to keep yield curve controls in place.The 10-year yield plunged as much as 14 basis points to 0.36% at its lowest point, which would have been the biggest one-day decline since September 2003, before edging back up to 0.43% as of 1024 GMT. The yield was at 0.51% prior to the Bank of Japan decision.Story continuesIn a Reuters poll, 97% of economists expected the BOJ to maintain its ultra-easy policy at the meeting.""It was a tough day for the bond vigilantes who were positioned to bully the BOJ into a policy change not justified by their economic forecasts,"" said Sean Callow, a senior currency strategist at Westpac.The dollar was up 1% at 12.953 yen but well off session highs.The dollar index, which measures the safe-haven dollar against six peers, rose 0.4%. It has been undermined lately by falling U.S. bond yields as markets wager the Federal Reserve can be less aggressive in hiking rates.The pound rose over 0.4% and the euro gained 0.6%.ENERGY PRICE RALLYOil prices rose on Wednesday, extending the previous session's gains, driven by optimism that the lifting of China's strict COVID-19 curbs will lead to a recovery in fuel demand in the world's top oil importer.Brent crude LCOc1 futures vaulted 1.30%, to $87.03 a barrel by 1025 GMT, following a 1.7% rally in the previous session.In less than three weeks of 2023, foreign buying of Chinese stocks has exceeded last year's total as investors bet on the country's rapid recovery after COVID-19 lockdowns were lifted.China's Vice Premier Liu He said he welcomed foreign investment and declared his country open to the world after three years of pandemic isolation.Data on Tuesday showed China's economic growth had slumped in 2022 to 3.0% - the weakest rate in nearly half a century.Spot gold rose over 0.2% to $1,913 per ounce., while copper prices touched seven-month highs.Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 0.9% at $9,367.50 a tonne.

A global stocks index also fell.Some investors said the drop in U.S. retail sales, together with subsiding inflation, could encourage the Fed to further scale back the pace of its interest rate increases next month.A separate report showed U.S. producer prices also fell more than expected in December.Even as inflation was showing signs of cooling, Fed policymakers reiterated their support for hiking the U.S. central bank's target interest rate above 5%.The U.S. central bank is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points when it concludes its two-day meeting on Feb. 1.Earlier, the Bank of Japan maintained its ultra-easy policy, including a bond yield cap, defying market expectations it would phase out its massive stimulus program because of increasing inflation pressures.The decision caused the yen to fall, with investors unwinding bets based on expectations the central bank would overhaul its yield control policy.In late-afternoon U.S. trading, the dollar was up 0.6% against the yen. The U.S. dollar index was nearly flat.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 613.89 points, or 1.81%, to 33,296.96, the S&amp;P 500 lost 62.11 points, or 1.56%, to 3,928.86 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 138.10 points, or 1.24%, to 10,957.01.""The market was overbought,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA research.

The peso, among the top performing EM currencies so far this year, rose 0.5% to 18.68 per dollar - its strongest level since February 2020. Bank of Mexico board member Jonathan Heath said he did not see any interest rate cuts happening in the next six months, in an interview with Bloomberg published Monday. ""Several metrics such as the real-effective exchange rate are beginning to suggest that the Mexican peso is becoming relatively expensive,"" said analysts at Scotiabank. ""We believe that an exchange rate move could be the catalyst for a rebound in investment as global bargain hunters swoop in."" Broadly, stock markets and currencies in resource-rich Latin America rose as prices of commodities including oil and copper rallied on hopes that a shift in China's COVID-19 policy will boost consumption. Brazil's Bovespa climbed 1.9%, with oil major Petrobras and miner Vale driving gains. ""We see the backdrop for EM assets turning more positive as EM rates peak, DM central banks pause, the U.S. dollar weakens and China reopens,"" strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute told clients. ""By contrast, the damage of higher rates has yet to fully materialize in DM."" Data earlier showed New York state manufacturing contracted sharply in January, pointing to continued weakness in national factory activity, hurt by the Fed's fastest interest rate hiking cycle since the 1980s. Brazil's real was up 0.8% against a broadly weakening dollar. Data showed inflation in Brazil as measured by the IGP-10 price index rose 0.05% in January, compared with a 0.36% gain in December. The real has made a volatile start to the year after a solid performance in 2022 on concerns about the new government's fiscal measures. Brazil's Finance Minister Fernando Haddad said on Monday it was ""very realistic"" to end this year with a primary budget deficit of 1% of gross domestic product. Chile's peso gained 0.8% to hover near seven-month highs, while Colombia's peso slipped about 0.9%. There is no need to further raise Colombia's benchmark interest rate - which is at a 23-year high of 12% - despite still-elevated inflation, the finance minister said.

140,87d5405e-4bc0-39e4-9691-76ae838c45ce,NRG,2023-01-18,"Bull of the Day: NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG)",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bull-day-nrg-energy-inc-090009701.html,1674032409,STORY,"['NRG', 'VVNT']","[NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG) is a utility and energy giant that sits at a potentially attractive longer-term entry point.NRG stock tumbled in early December after it announced a deal to buy Vivint Smart Home, Inc. (VVNT) as it aims to expand its reach for the age of smart homes and high-tech energy grids. NRG’s long-term goal is to become a “leading provider of essential services for homes and businesses.”NRG Energy is also a worthy consideration for 2023 given its dividend yield and stable, essential business model as the market could easily favor energy and utility stocks again amid all the unknowns.  Energy and Beyond NRG is a utility powerhouse that generates electricity and provides energy solutions and natural gas to millions of business and residential customers. The Houston, Texas-based company is now poised to roll out more digital-focused efforts as electric grids, homes, and businesses grow more high-tech by the day.NRG over the last year-plus explored how it could expand its reach to thrive in a world full of smart homes and connected energy grids. CEO Mauricio Gutierrez said on the company’s Q3 earnings call in early November that NRG was growing increasingly focused on the rapid expansion of connected devices and appliances within the internet of things revolution.NRG Energy decided it needed to capitalize on the growing smart home market and address a crucial drawback: too many different platforms and screens. “It is clear that a single interface for the home is of increasing importance and customer attitudes around these services are shifting from nice-to-have to need-to-have,” Gutierrez said.“Next, the electrification of the economy through smart technology and clean energy choices is real. We are seeing an increasing number of devices and appliances connected like HVAC, water heaters, battery, rooftop solar and other, in addition to having greater penetration of electric vehicles.”Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesRoughly a month later, NRG announced a big splash to help it expand almost overnight into much more than a utility firm. NRG Energy said on December 6 that it agreed to buy Vivint Smart Home, Inc. for $12 per share or $2.8 billion in an all-cash deal. NRG Energy sees the Vivint purchase, which it paid a 33% premium for compared to its closing price prior to the deal, as a fantastic way to establish itself as a “leading provider of essential home services.”The deal is projected to close at some point in the first quarter of 2023. The newly beefed-up and diversified NRG will boast a network of approximately 7.4 million customers across North America. NRG will likely incorporate Vivint’s backend tech ecosystem across the firm.The beefed-up firm will be able to bundle offerings for utilities, home security, automation, and more, with more people than ever craving high-tech, centralized minimalism for their homes. NRG is preparing for a world where homes and businesses seamlessly manage and optimize energy storage, electric vehicle charging, and beyond.Other Fundamentals Wall Street showed its displeasure with NRG for seemingly stepping out of its lane to buy a smart home company with offerings that include security, lighting, and beyond. NRG sees the acquisition as helping it prepare for a totally connected future as it brings in a company and its tech that already lives inside people’s homes.NRG remains confident in its planned acquisition for many reasons. The deal creates more stable and predictable earnings for NRG as it boosts its business beyond fluctuating energy prices, given Vivint’s subscription-based model and long customer history.NRG’s post-Vivint announcement selloff has it trading around 33% below its highs at roughly $32 per share. NRG is also trading at a 60% discount to its industry at 6.4X forward earnings and 50% below its own 10-year median. The nearby chart shows that NRG is trading near its covid/all-time lows.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe recent tumble has NRG shares neck-and-neck with its industry during the past five years, up 16%. Plus, NRG’s Utility - Electric Power industry currently ranks in the top 30% of over 250 Zacks industries. NRG Energy’s dividend currently yields 4.4% to crush its industry’s 3.1%, with a very sustainable 23% payout ratio.The company also plans to complete its $1 billion buyback program over the near term, of which $360 million was remaining as of November 30. NRG said it plans to use its excess free cash flow to fund the Vivint acquisition, as well as reduce acquisition-related debt, and maintain its common stock dividend growth policy in 2023. NRG then plans to return to its 50% return of capital / 50% growth capital allocation policy in 2024.Bottom LineZacks estimates call for NRG’s 2022 revenue to soar 20% to $32.34 billion to help lift its adjusted earnings by 45% to $11.12 per share. The top and bottom line strength is being driven, in part, by soaring energy and utility prices.NRG is projected to see a rather significant pullback in 2023. Yet, its overall earnings outlook has trended largely upward for FY22 and FY23. NRG’s bottom-line positivity helps the stock land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now, and it currently trades 19% below its average Zacks price target.Overall, NRG offers investors value and dividends for what could be another turbulent 2023. Plus, NRG will soon be a much more diversified firm prepared to thrive in the world of connected smart homes and tech-centric energy grids.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that report, analysts expect NRG Energy to post earnings of $1.35 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 239.18%.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for NRG Energy. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

SIG, NRG Energy, Inc. NRG, Unum Group UNM and Sterling Infrastructure STRL.Pick These Low P/CF Stocks to Spruce Up Your PortfolioValue style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock's inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company's financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Signet Jewelers Ltd., NRG Energy, Inc., Unum Group and Sterling Infrastructure boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company's earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company's liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company's liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesHowever, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:Signet, the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

The company recorded currency-adjusted revenue growth in second-quarter fiscal 2023, aided by a solid dental market. The trend is expected to continue. However, supplier concentration issues and stiff competitive forces persist.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 1.4% against the industry’s 2.5% and the S&amp;P 500’s 14.1% decline.This renowned global dental and animal health company has a market capitalization of $2.8 billion. The company’s earnings are estimated to grow for the next five years at an annual rate of 7.8%. Patterson Companies’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering a surprise of 7.88%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s delve deeper.Broad Product Spectrum: We are optimistic about Patterson Companies’ wide range of consumable supplies, equipment and software, and value-added services. A notable offering from the company is a private-label brand named Pivotal (introduced during fiscal 2020). The company continues adding SKUs to its broad private-label portfolio. Patterson Companies’ NaVetor is an integrated cloud-based veterinary practice management software for its Animal Health segment.Dental Market Holds Promise: Gradual recovery in the dental market and the rebounding dental equipment business (especially in North America), assisted by promotional activities, are expected to be advantageous for Patterson Companies. Sales in this segment were up 1.1% year over year during second-quarter fiscal 2023. The company’s field sales, service and support teams remain committed to delivering value to its customers and business partners, thereby driving solid operational excellence.Solid Prospects of the Animal Health Unit: Patterson Companies' growing Animal Health unit is a key long-term growth driver. Management at Patterson Companies expects solid margin improvement in the Animal Health unit through stronger partnerships with product manufacturers and strong sales execution. The company’s companion animal and production animal businesses are anticipated to maintain sustained growth. The company is optimistic that the Animal Health business is well-poised to drive the top line and, thereby, margins in the near term. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment registered internal sales growth of 0.7%, owing to sustained strength in the production animal business. The Animal Health segment delivered gross margin and operating margin improvement in the quarter under review, on the back of higher sales growth with vendor partners, improved product mix with solid product sales, private label products, equipment and software, and a team focused on expense discipline.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition in the Niche Space: The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and consists chiefly of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors. Patterson Companies faces competition from other national and full-service firms and at least 15 full-service distributors that operate on a regional level besides hundreds of small local distributors. PDCO needs to introduce products to withstand competitive pressure. Failure to do so can dilute the company’s market share.Supplier Concentration Issues: Patterson Companies faces significant key supplier concentration. The company’s top 10 supply vendors account for more than 40% of its cost of dental products sold in a fiscal year. The loss of relationship with these vendors will disrupt the supply of raw materials, which, in turn, will lead to lower sales. A prolonged period of economic instability could reduce customers’ ability to make payments.Estimate TrendPatterson Companies is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings in fiscal 2023 has increased from $2.27 to $2.28 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.62 billion, suggesting a 1.5% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. The earnings estimate for the fiscal third-quarter of 60 cents per share implies a 9.1% improvement from the year-ago period.Patterson Companies, Inc. PricePatterson Companies, Inc.

European shares climbed after a string of positive earnings updates.Europe's STOXX 600 index rose to its highest level since April 2022.Three factors have propelled stock markets higher, Andreas Bruckner, european equity strategist at BofA Global Research, said.These were an expectation for a dovish pivot from the U.S. Federal Reserve, economic data that showed companies working overtime to deal with order backlogs, and China's economy re-opening faster than expected from COVID-19 lockdowns.""But the sugar high that markets are on will eventually disappear because it will be impossible to mask an underlying weakness in economic demand,"" said Bruckner.London's FTSE 100 scaled a fresh 4-1/2-year high after the latest UK inflation numbers, although worries over tight monetary policy remained as the rate hovered in double-digit territory.The internationally focused FTSE 100 edged 0.1% higher. The pan-European STOXX 600 was 0.2% higher, boosted by rate-sensitive technology stocks, while U.S. stock futures were mixed.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan rose 0.4%.JAPANThe market spotlight was also on Japan, where the yen slid and government bond yields fell the most in two decades at one point, retreating sharply from the central bank's 0.5% ceiling after policymakers decided to keep yield curve controls in place.The 10-year yield plunged as much as 14 basis points to 0.36% at its lowest point, which would have been the biggest one-day decline since September 2003, before edging back up to 0.43% as of 1024 GMT. The yield was at 0.51% prior to the Bank of Japan decision.Story continuesIn a Reuters poll, 97% of economists expected the BOJ to maintain its ultra-easy policy at the meeting.""It was a tough day for the bond vigilantes who were positioned to bully the BOJ into a policy change not justified by their economic forecasts,"" said Sean Callow, a senior currency strategist at Westpac.The dollar was up 1% at 12.953 yen but well off session highs.The dollar index, which measures the safe-haven dollar against six peers, rose 0.4%. It has been undermined lately by falling U.S. bond yields as markets wager the Federal Reserve can be less aggressive in hiking rates.The pound rose over 0.4% and the euro gained 0.6%.ENERGY PRICE RALLYOil prices rose on Wednesday, extending the previous session's gains, driven by optimism that the lifting of China's strict COVID-19 curbs will lead to a recovery in fuel demand in the world's top oil importer.Brent crude LCOc1 futures vaulted 1.30%, to $87.03 a barrel by 1025 GMT, following a 1.7% rally in the previous session.In less than three weeks of 2023, foreign buying of Chinese stocks has exceeded last year's total as investors bet on the country's rapid recovery after COVID-19 lockdowns were lifted.China's Vice Premier Liu He said he welcomed foreign investment and declared his country open to the world after three years of pandemic isolation.Data on Tuesday showed China's economic growth had slumped in 2022 to 3.0% - the weakest rate in nearly half a century.Spot gold rose over 0.2% to $1,913 per ounce., while copper prices touched seven-month highs.Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 0.9% at $9,367.50 a tonne.

A global stocks index also fell.Some investors said the drop in U.S. retail sales, together with subsiding inflation, could encourage the Fed to further scale back the pace of its interest rate increases next month.A separate report showed U.S. producer prices also fell more than expected in December.Even as inflation was showing signs of cooling, Fed policymakers reiterated their support for hiking the U.S. central bank's target interest rate above 5%.The U.S. central bank is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points when it concludes its two-day meeting on Feb. 1.Earlier, the Bank of Japan maintained its ultra-easy policy, including a bond yield cap, defying market expectations it would phase out its massive stimulus program because of increasing inflation pressures.The decision caused the yen to fall, with investors unwinding bets based on expectations the central bank would overhaul its yield control policy.In late-afternoon U.S. trading, the dollar was up 0.6% against the yen. The U.S. dollar index was nearly flat.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 613.89 points, or 1.81%, to 33,296.96, the S&amp;P 500 lost 62.11 points, or 1.56%, to 3,928.86 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 138.10 points, or 1.24%, to 10,957.01.""The market was overbought,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA research. He said some investors took profits in areas of recent strong gains.The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.23% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.71%.Story continuesIn other currencies, the Australian dollar fell 0.7% to US$0.6936, after hitting its highest level since August last year. The New Zealand dollar traded flat on the day at US$0.6430.Benchmark 10-year notes fell as low as 3.372%, the lowest since Sept. 13. Two-year yields reached 4.072%, the lowest since Oct. 4. The yield spread between two-year and 10-year notes was last a minus 70 basis points.In the energy market, oil prices fell as worries about a possible U.S. recession outweighed optimism over China's lifting of COVID-19 curbs.Brent futures fell 94 cents, or 1.1%, to settle at $84.98 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 70 cents, or 0.9%, to settle at 79.48.Bitcoin was last down 1.8%.(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch in New York; Additional reporting by Sinead Carew in New York and Nell Mackenzie and Alun John in London; Editing by Sharon Singleton and Matthew Lewis)]"

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's 0.2% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.14%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.39%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the processor of debit and credit card payments had gained 10.04% over the past month. This has outpaced the Business Services sector's gain of 6.01% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.01% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from MasterCard as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be January 26, 2023. In that report, analysts expect MasterCard to post earnings of $2.56 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 8.94%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $5.75 billion, up 10.33% from the year-ago period.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for MasterCard should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.13% lower. MasterCard is holding a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now.Investors should also note MasterCard's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 31.27. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 14.33, so we one might conclude that MasterCard is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that MA has a PEG ratio of 1.69. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Financial Transaction Services industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 0.96 as of yesterday's close.The Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Business Services sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 152, putting it in the bottom 40% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

HRI, Nexstar Media Group, Inc. NXST, Expedia Group, Inc. EXPE and Agilent Technologies, Inc. A.These 4 Stocks Boast Impressive Interest Coverage RatiosAn ill-informed investor can lose cash if he wagers on a stock only on the basis of the numbers flashing on a real-time stock screen. A critical analysis of the company's financial background is always required for a better investment decision, especially at a time when the stock market is juggling myriad issues, such as soaring inflation, supply chain bottlenecks and a hawkish monetary policy.Often, investors evaluate a company's performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings, which sometimes do not reveal the real picture. To be more precise, they do not tell whether a company's fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations. Here, the coverage ratio comes into play — the higher the metric, the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for the majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. The company's creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. One should also track the company's past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Story continuesHerc Holdings Inc., Nexstar Media Group, Inc., Expedia Group, Inc. and Agilent Technologies, Inc. boast an impressive interest coverage ratio.Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:Herc Holdings, which operates as an equipment rental supplier in the United States and internationally, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of B.

(NYSE:WEC) down to US$30b market cap, but institutional owners may not be as affected after a year of 2.0% returns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wec-energy-group-inc-nyse-101505166.html,1674036905,STORY,['WEC'],"[A look at the shareholders of WEC Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE:WEC) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 75% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Losing money on investments is something no shareholder enjoys, least of all institutional investors who saw their holdings value drop by 3.2% last week. However, the 2.0% one-year return to shareholders might have softened the blow. But they would probably be wary of future losses.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of WEC Energy Group, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About WEC Energy Group?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.WEC Energy Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of WEC Energy Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in WEC Energy Group. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 13% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.3% and 6.1% of the stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of WEC Energy GroupThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of WEC Energy Group, Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$46m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 25% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand WEC Energy Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for WEC Energy Group   (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend reinvestments and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best DRIP Stocks To Own. A dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, is an investment strategy through which investors reinvest their cash dividends into the respective company’s additional shares. DRIP strategy has proven to be one of the most convenient schemes for generating compounded returns. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, spoke to CNBC about the benefits of investing in dividend stocks during inflationary periods. He mentioned that dividend stocks ‘reduce the overall volatility’. He also asserted that reinvested dividends contributed 33% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 since 1945.Various reports have revealed the importance of reinvested dividends in overall market returns. According to Schroders, the average annual growth across eight markets without dividend reinvestment was 4.3% from 1993 to 2018 and jumped to 7.1% when reinvested dividends were included.

Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned -1.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Johnson &amp; Johnson falls in, has lost 0.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.22 per share, indicating a change of +4.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.04 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.5%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.29 indicates a change of +2.4% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Johnson &amp; Johnson.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for JNJ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate of $23.79 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -4.1%. The $95.02 billion and $98.01 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.3% and +3.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $23.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.9%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $2.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.2%. The EPS surprise was +2.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

170,8f78d3cc-4c20-3ea4-9926-3ce6ba1e6696,MDT,2023-01-18,Why Supplier Diversity Matters,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-supplier-diversity-matters-141500861.html,1673964900,STORY,['MDT'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / January 17, 2023 / When companies harness the power of supplier diversity programs, they can have a transformative impact on their own businesses as well as underserved communities. By implementing supplier diversity initiatives, companies and organizations gain access to innovation from diverse networks of suppliers, reflect their values and commitments to social responsibility, and create positive community impacts through strengthened economic development. Here we explore why supplier diversity matters to Medtronic and how it can benefit both companies and communities alike.Supplier diversity initiatives create jobs and wealth opportunity: By expanding the pool of suppliers to include diverse businesses, supplier diversity programs help ensure that minority and women-owned businesses have access to potentially life-changing economic opportunities. Diverse suppliers create job opportunities for people who may otherwise have difficulty accessing them. These jobs often come with access to improved wages and better benefits that help support a family, enable a child's higher education, or buy a home. In some cases, these opportunities can positively impact a family's economic stability for multiple generations. In 2022, Medtronic supplier diversity partnerships helped support 29,000 jobs with small and diverse owned business in the United States.It benefits underserved communities: By providing access to economic opportunities for diverse suppliers of all backgrounds, supplier diversity programs help fight against institutionalized racism and help close the wage gap. Diverse businesses are given a chance to compete on an even playing field, which helps ensure fairness and equality throughout the business landscape. The taxes generated can fund local schools, public works projects and other community initiatives in underserved or impoverished areas.It leads to innovation: When companies reach out to diverse supplier networks, they open the door to new ideas and perspectives that are often found outside of their traditional supply chains. This can lead to increased efficiency in the production process, improved customer service and better innovation overall. This can not only result in groundbreaking products and services, but also foster better customer service and strengthen relationships with vendors. It opens up the market to more participants who bring new ideas, perspectives and techniques which can help organizations stay ahead of the curve when it comes to meeting customer needs.At the end of the day, supplier diversity programs have far-reaching implications for both companies and communities. By engaging a diverse pool of suppliers, companies benefit from improved innovation, an equitable workplace environment and a strong statement about their corporate values. Meanwhile, members of underrepresented communities gain access to economic opportunities that enable them to create wealth and support local economies. In short, investing in supplier diversity is an investment in the future that will help build stronger businesses and greater mutual prosperity for all involved.Learn more about supplier diversity efforts at Medtronic.Medtronic, Tuesday, January 17, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Medtronic on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: MedtronicWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/medtronicEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: MedtronicView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/735505/Why-Supplier-Diversity-Matters]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend reinvestments and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best DRIP Stocks To Own. A dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, is an investment strategy through which investors reinvest their cash dividends into the respective company’s additional shares. DRIP strategy has proven to be one of the most convenient schemes for generating compounded returns. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, spoke to CNBC about the benefits of investing in dividend stocks during inflationary periods. He mentioned that dividend stocks ‘reduce the overall volatility’. He also asserted that reinvested dividends contributed 33% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 since 1945.Various reports have revealed the importance of reinvested dividends in overall market returns. According to Schroders, the average annual growth across eight markets without dividend reinvestment was 4.3% from 1993 to 2018 and jumped to 7.1% when reinvested dividends were included. The report also mentioned that the S&amp;P 500 returned 7.5% during the same periods without dividends, with dividend reinvestments taking the total return to 9.7%. Another study done by Professor Elroy at London Business School for the Credit Suisse Yearbook 2011 mentioned that investments made from 1900 to 2010 would have generated an annualized return of 5%. However, the total return would have jumped to 9.4% with reinvested dividends.With rising interest rates and growing inflation, investors prefer dividend stocks to generate stable income. In this regard, companies that raise their dividends regularly and have stable cash flow generation gain investors’ attention. Charles Schwab cited data from Compustat, Ned Davis Research, S&amp;P Capital IQ, and S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which shows that stocks that grew and initiated their dividends returned 13.7% from 1981 to 2020, compared with a 9.60% return of those that didn’t pay dividends.

Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”7.

(MRK) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-co-inc-mrk-trending-140002044.html,1673964002,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck (MRK) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +2.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Merck falls in, has lost 0.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.55 per share, indicating a change of -13.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.39 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +22.8%. This estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.30 indicates a change of -1.3% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRK _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Merck, the consensus sales estimate of $13.71 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.4%. The $59.16 billion and $58.22 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +18% and -1.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $14.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.7%. EPS of $1.85 for the same period compares with $1.75 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.05 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.43%. The EPS surprise was +10.78%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Jet delivery delays spark penalties battle,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whos-blame-jet-delivery-delays-112949737.html,1674041389,STORY,"['BA', 'EADSY']","[By Tim Hepher and Padraic HalpinDUBLIN (Reuters) - A battle for compensation is brewing over delays in the delivery of commercial jets, with a Dublin aviation summit descending into a blame game over the worst industrial disruption in years.Airbus and Boeing are on average delivering new jetliners three-to-six months late, blaming post-pandemic havoc in supply chains, delegates at two major aviation finance conferences said.Powerful leasing companies heaped pressure on planemakers over the delays, with Air Lease Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy telling this week's Airline Economics conference that manufacturers had ""grossly misjudged"" their output.Airbus and Boeing defended their record, saying the situation is the result of a mix of factors, from the pandemic to weak supply chains, and a sudden snapback in travel demand.The public exchanges reflect the battle lines in negotiations behind the scenes over whether manufacturers should bear contractual responsibility by paying penalties, even when suppliers are at fault, people involved in the discussions said.With January already marked by fresh delay notices being sent to airlines and leasing companies, experts said millions of dollars of exposure are riding on one word: ""excusable"".Aircraft contracts contain dense descriptions of adverse factors which excuse manufacturers for multiple types of delay, meaning they can avoid paying penalties or ""liquidated damages"".Excusable delays include ""acts of God"", natural disasters, fire, flood, earthquakes and epidemics, among other examples, according to extracts of past contracts filed with regulators.They may give the manufacturer a get-out in the event of a failure to obtain parts. Wars and strikes are also excusable.Non-excusable delays include anything that falls outside this catalogue, but are rare, experts say. Only the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX over design defects was treated as a non-excusable delay on a significant scale, resulting in hefty compensation payments from Boeing, industry sources said.Story continuesWith last year's deliveries below target and doubts rising over 2023, planemakers are once again invoking the ""excusable delay"" clause, buyers said. Airbus and Boeing declined comment on contractual matters.But three years after the early spread of COVID-19, with demand now surging and China coming back onto the market, lessors used their annual summit to argue enough is enough.'OVER-OPTIMISTIC'""They are not excusable at all,"" Aengus Kelly, chief executive of lease giant AerCap told the Airfinance Journal conference when asked about the delays.""(Manufacturers) were just wildly over-optimistic in what they could produce. They are trying to blame COVID but COVID has long gone.""France ended a COVID-related state of emergency last July. The World Health Organisation said last month there were ""still too many uncertainties and gaps for us to say the pandemic is over"", but added it hoped to declare the emergency over in 2023.Tensions have been exacerbated by the increasingly short notice for delays, lessors said. Filling the gap may involve getting jets out of storage, which means facing maintenance bills and bottlenecks in repair shops.The amount of damages at stake varies from contract to contract, but one buyer said typical exposure in the event of inexcusable delays could reach $20,000 a day for single-aisle jets, rising up to a ceiling of $2 million-3 million per plane.Even so, that may not mean a cash windfall. Jetmakers prefer to offer credits and large buyers have the scope to renegotiate earlier deals.""I think it is more likely that there is some other form of concession from the manufacturers. Whether it crosses the line of a liquidated damages payment ... is part of an overall commercial discussion,"" said Andy Cronin, chief executive of leasing company Avolon.""But if it persists I wouldn't rule it out,"" he told Reuters.(Additional reporting by Conor Humphries.

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.2%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.14%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 1.39%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the health insurer had lost 5.01% over the past month. This has lagged the Finance sector's gain of 7.8% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.01% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Cigna as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be February 3, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $4.84, up 1.47% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $45.58 billion, down 0.22% from the year-ago period.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Cigna. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Cigna is holding a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Cigna has a Forward P/E ratio of 12.66 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 9.54, so we one might conclude that Cigna is trading at a premium comparatively.Also, we should mention that CI has a PEG ratio of 1.13. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Insurance - Multi line stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.21 based on yesterday's closing prices.Story continuesThe Insurance - Multi line industry is part of the Finance sector.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this health insurer have returned -5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4% change. The Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, to which Cigna belongs, has gained 3.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Cigna is expected to post earnings of $4.84 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.14 points to a change of +13% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.81 indicates a change of +7.2% from what Cigna is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cigna is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CI _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Cigna, the consensus sales estimate of $45.58 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.2%. The $180.59 billion and $189.41 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.7% and +4.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCigna reported revenues of $45.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.4%. EPS of $6.04 for the same period compares with $5.73 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $44.87 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.1%. The EPS surprise was +5.96%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cigna is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cigna. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While not providing the same level of coverage as your standard blue-chip stalwart, these relatively underappreciated ideas provide a balance of growth and stability.Indeed, those who consider dabbling with these under-the-radar retirement stocks may enjoy 14% upside potential. How did I come up with such a figure? After filtering out fiscally stable companies, I then totaled each of their analyst price targets. On average, the return came out to 14.14%.To be sure, some ideas are much more reliable than others, though feature lower upside potential as a consequence. With this list, you can choose your risk-reward magnitude.

Retirement stocks.Source: kenary820 / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Coconut Grove, Florida, Watsco (NYSE:WSO) is the largest distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment, and related parts and supplies in the U.S. Though a boring entry among under-the-radar retirement stocks to buy, it should command permanent relevance. In the trailing year, WSO dipped nearly 9%.Aligned with the lackluster performance in the chart, analysts neither love nor hate Watsco. Presently, the company features a consensus hold rating. Further, the average price target is $287, indicating 4.4% upside potential from the time of writing. It’s not the greatest forecast, to be honest. Still, hedge funds have been building a position since the first quarter of 2022.Against traditional metrics, WSO offers a reliable opportunity for those seeking long-term stability. The company features an Altman Z-Score of 8.6, reflecting very low bankruptcy risk. As well, its return on equity stands at nearly 31%, reflecting a very high-quality business. Overall, it’s not exciting but it serves its purpose as one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks.Story continuesInfosys (INFY)Graphic of side view of virtual financial charts with tech aesthetic, symbolizing fintechSource: shutterstock.com/whiteMoccaBased in India, Infosys (NYSE:INFY) is a multinational information technology company, that provides business consulting, IT, and outsourcing services. Though it seems incredibly relevant, INFY suffered a tough time on Wall Street. In the trailing year, shares gave up 28% of equity value.Similar to Watsco, analysts feature a pensive view of the enterprise. Currently, INFY has a consensus hold rating. Additionally, the experts peg INFY as hitting an average price target of $19.55, implying upside of slightly more than 6%. Keep in mind that Infosys offers a forward yield of 2.19%. That’s notably higher than the technology sector’s average dividend yield of 1.37%.On the balance sheet, Infosys offers a stable profile. Its Altman Z-Score hit 10.3, reflecting extremely low bankruptcy risk. As well, its debt-to-equity ratio of 0.07 times rates more favorably than over 71% of the competition. Finally, INFY features excellent profitability metrics. Therefore, it’s worth consideration among under-the-radar retirement stocks.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Irvine, California, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a semiconductor specialist, delivering innovative, high-performance chips. Skyworks operates as a pivotal cog in the 5G rollout. Still, various challenges impacting the tech sector haven’t been kind to SWKS. In the trailing year, shares gave up almost 34% of equity value.However, analysts remain undeterred, rating SWKS as a consensus moderate buy. As well, they anticipate on average SWKS hitting a price target of $109.44, implying upside of slightly over 8%. Moreover, Skyworks offers a forward yield of 2.45%, again beating the tech sector average of 1.37%. Also, the payout ratio sits at 22.2%, suggesting that the dividend is sustainable.Objectively, Skyworks distinguishes itself for its undervalued profile. Currently, the market prices shares at 9.8 times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median is just under 18 times. Plus, the company enjoys a decently stable balance sheet and excellent profitability metrics. Thus, it’s another worthy example of under-the-radar retirement stocks to consider.Hormel Foods (HRL)retirement stocks: a roadsign that says ""retirement ahead"". retirement stocksSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Austin, Minnesota, Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) – as its name implies – represents a food-processing firm. It actually sprung to life as a corporate entity in 1891, per its public profile. Naturally, Hormel should benefit from inelastic demand because of its critical underlying product. However, Wall Street doesn’t see it that way, with HRL declining 6% in the trailing year.Nevertheless, analysts remain undeterred, pegging Hormel as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target calls for $50.33. This represents a potential upside of a bit over 8%. Investors should also note that the company offers a forward yield of 2.36%, beating out the consumer staples sector’s average yield of 1.89%.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value, HRL rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, Hormel’s Altman Z-Score hit 4.9, reflecting stability in its finances. Plus, the food enterprise enjoys strong profitability metrics. Therefore, you probably can’t go too wrong with HRL as one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks.National Instruments (NATI)a financial planner showing a couple a piece of paperSource: ShutterstockLocated in Austin, Texas, National Instruments (NASDAQ:NATI) is a producer of automated test equipment and virtual instrumentation software. Per its corporate profile, applications include data acquisition, instrument control, and machine vision. In the trailing year, NATI dropped a hair over 4% in equity value. But in the past five days, it’s been on the move, gaining almost 10%.To be sure, Wall Street analysts take the optimistic side of the fence. Currently, they peg NATI as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target hit $46.14, indicating nearly 15% upside potential from the time of writing. Sweetening the pot, National Instruments offers a forward yield of 2.79%. This rates slightly higher than the sector average yield of 2.36%.Objectively, NATI enjoys an undervalued profile. Right now, the market prices shares at 15.6 times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median stands at 24.4 times. As well, the company commands strong profit margins and decent stability in the balance sheet. Overall, it’s one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks to consider.RMR Group (RMR)retirement stocks: miniature figurines climb a staircase made of coinsSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Newton, Massachusetts, RMR Group (NASDAQ:RMR) inherently presents high risks among under-the-radar retirement stocks because of its core business. Per its website, RMR is a leading U.S. alternative asset management company, unique for its focus on commercial real estate and related businesses. In the trailing year, shares fell more than 13%. To be fair, though, in the trailing month, it’s up over 4%.While only two analysts cover RMR Group, it presently features a consensus moderate buy view. Together, the experts’ price target hit $35.50 on average, implying a potential upside of over 19%. That’s a hefty tally for one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks. Also, the company offers a generous forward yield of 5.38%.Objectively speaking, RMR Group is undervalued relative to its sales performance, with shares trading at 1.07 times sales. In contrast, the sector median stands at 2.4 times. As well, the company enjoys solid strengths in the balance sheet.Consolidated Water (CWCO)an elderly couple jumping up in a white household. Cheap retirement stocksSource: ShutterstockAs a critical resource company, Consolidated Water (NASDAQ:CWCO) deserves consideration for under-the-radar retirement stocks to buy. According to its website, Consolidated Water supplies potable (drinking) water and water treatment services. It serves the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands, and the U.S. In the trailing year, CWCO gained nearly 43%.To be clear, only one analyst covers CWCO, with a moderate buy view. Still, if Consolidated Water keeps delivering performances like the one mentioned above, it could attract more covering experts. Presently, the sole analyst pegs CWCO as hitting $20. This implies an upside potential of almost 38%. As a bonus, the company offers a forward yield of 2.34% (though it’s under the utility sector average of 3.75%).On the financials, Consolidated Water enjoys excellent strengths in the balance sheet. Most notably, its cash-to-debt ratio stands at 20.4 times, above over 89% of the competition. Thus, it may make for a reliable entry among high-upside-potential under-the-radar retirement stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

These big-picture positives notwithstanding, the Zacks analyst flagged margin pressures due to higher costs and bigger markdowns. The company provided a bleak view for fiscal 2023 and second-quarter driven by expectations of higher markdowns during the holiday season and slowed demand for NIKE's brands, including Jordan and Converse, due to reduced discretionary spending.

Corporation (VFC) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-v-f-140002902.html,1673964002,STORY,['VFC'],"[V.F. (VFC) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this maker of brands such as Vans, North Face and Timberland have returned +19.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4% change. The Zacks Textile - Apparel industry, to which V.F. belongs, has gained 9.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.V.F. is expected to post earnings of $1 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -25.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.10 points to a change of -34% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.35 indicates a change of +12.2% from what V.F. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for V.F.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VFC _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For V.F. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.48 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -3.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.57 billion and $12.18 billion estimates indicate -2.3% and +5.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryV.F. reported revenues of $3.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.7%. EPS of $0.73 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.1 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.73%. The EPS surprise was -1.35%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.V.F. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about V.F. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

I know you've been tracking this story. We've been talking about potential buyers there for the business. The stock actually got an upgrade from Wells Fargo. What did they like ahead of that?ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, WWE is one of those stocks that's really been in the spotlight lately. Wells Fargo upgrading shares to equal weight from underweight. Also upped its price target to $100 a share up from $52 a share.And analyst Steve Cahall wrote in that upgrade note, quote, ""WWE's strategic process has a reasonable probability of success."" And a lot of that has to do with potential buyers. Some of those names include Netflix, Amazon, Comcast, Disney. They all want a piece of this at the end of the day.And, of course, we heard from a source that told Yahoo Finance last week that WWE has not been sold to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. That was a [INAUDIBLE] rumor that sent shares higher. But, again, all still a possibility.And Wells Fargo did estimate that WWE could be worth about $8 billion in a sale. Its current market cap is around $6.6 billion. So we'll have to wait and see what happens with this stock.SEANA SMITH: We will. The stock closing up just about 3/10 of a percent. All right.

You can see shares falling up more than 3%. The analyst behind the call seeing Pfizer's efforts as underappreciated by investors, but still believes it needs a reset. Here with more is Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Anj, what's the latest?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right, Dave. Well, as you know, you mentioned the Wells Fargo downgrade. So let's get that full quote up for you. It is, quote, ""We think Pfizer needs a COVID reset before the stock could work again. And we think the company could have an attractive profile as it aspires to grow pretty significantly in the next coming years."" Now, really, what's on tap for Pfizer is they are faced with, of course, a rock solid blockbuster with the vaccine and Paxlovid as well.And moving on from that, as we know, the company needs to move on from COVID. And what does that pipeline look like? They do have some patent cliffs that they're looking at for some of their older blockbusters. But the company has been looking at this for some time. In fact, earlier in May of 2021, CEO Albert Bourla told me, quote, ""We do think our stock is undervalued, but we do not worry that investors cannot see it.""So at the time, he was convinced that the company wasn't getting enough credit for its COVID products, but that it could soon. And they've done a lot of stuff in terms of M&amp;A, looking at new products, getting in from the outside. And that's really where the company's focus is. But I want to show you a really interesting chart, which is the operational growth of the company per quarter. This is quarter one of '20, versus-- sorry, quarter four of '20 versus growth without the vaccine.And if you take a look at what '21 looks like, that's an even more astounding number, 106% with COVID products, negative 2 without. And that's the revenue there. So really an interesting focus for the company. But, you know, Albert Bourla did tell us that he knows that this is the year that they're going to be releasing about 10 products, he hopes. And he spoke last All Markets Summit with Julie Hyman, and here's what he said.Story continuesItALBERT BOURLA: Is the year that we can prove to the world and can prove to us that we can do multiple launches.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: So as you can see, company is ready to prove itself. They have been trying to erase this idea that they are a COVID-only company. We'll see how it goes.DAVE BRIGGS: They were around, pretty successful prior to COVID. It is a reset year, though, of proving time. Anj, thank you so much.]"

Revenue was $1.26 billion, missing the consensus estimate of $1.33 billion. According to a report by the New York Times, the company is in discussions with Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm, to potentially sell its assets, including buybuy Baby stores, as part of a potential bankruptcy process.S3 Partners Research stated that if the stock continues to increase in value, some short-sellers may choose to end their positions and take the profits they made in 2022. But, the analyst also warned that the possibility of bankruptcy for the company is a significant risk and may cause short-sellers to hold onto their positions and wait for a potential $0.00 stock value in the event of bankruptcy.Shares lost 30% Friday from their Thursday peak closing at $3.66.JPMorgan and Wells Fargo top consensusJPMorgan (NYSE: NYSE:JPM) shares had a brief drop on the bank's earnings as CEO Jamie Dimon warns of headwinds, but still closed the week higher. Q4 EPS came in at $3.57, better than the consensus estimate of $3.11. Revenue was $34.5 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $34.17 billion.The bank announced that it had set aside $1.4 billion as a precautionary measure for a potential mild recession, despite reporting better-than-expected quarterly profits due to the strong performance of its trading unit. Dimon stated during a conference call that the bank is facing increased competition for deposits as customers are opting for other investment opportunities with higher interest rates. He acknowledged that the bank will have to adjust its saving rates accordingly.Story continuesHe also noted that consumers are still spending and businesses are still strong, but there are several uncertainties in the economy such as geopolitical tensions including the war in Ukraine, the vulnerable state of energy and food supplies, persistent inflation, and the unprecedented quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve. The bank has also noted a slight decline in its overall economic outlook, with the possibility of a mild recession being the ""central case."" Shares closed more than 3% higher for the week.Wells Fargo (NYSE: NYSE:WFC) shares closed up more than 3% Friday following the company’s reported Q4 results, with EPS of $1.37(ex-items) coming in better than the consensus estimate of $1.27.

Rising interest rates drove strong net interest income growth, credit losses have continued to increase slowly but credit quality remained strong,"" CEO Charles Scharf said in a press release.Rounding out last week's big earnings reportsKB Home (NYSE:KBH) shares fell nearly 3% on Thursday following the company’s reported Q4 results, with EPS of $2.47 missing the consensus estimate of $2.87. Revenue grew 16% year-over-year to $1.94 billion, coming in worse than the consensus estimate of $1.98 billion.The company provided its outlook for Q1/23, expecting housing revenues in the range of $1.25-$1.40 billion and an average selling price in the range of $490,000-$500,000. Given significant uncertainty and limited forward visibility regarding the 2023 housing market, and challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, the company provided its guidance for fiscal 2023 only for housing revenues, which are expected to be in the range of $5.00-$6.00 billion. Shares closed higher for the week.And Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) beat Q4 estimates but shares fell more than 3% on Friday after the airline said it expects Q1 EPS to come in the range of $0.15-0.40, a big miss compared to the consensus of $0.54. Q4 EPS came in at $1.48, better than the consensus estimate of $1.32. Revenue was $13.4 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $12.26 billion.“While we remain positive on DAL shares (Buy-rated), and there will be level setting across the industry this year for higher labor rates, we expect shares to react negatively initially as the market digests the higher cost outlook given recent outperformance,” Goldman Sachs said.Delta shares were up 4.5% for the week.***If you’re interested in upgrading your search for new investing ideas, check out InvestingPro.Related ArticlesEmerson makes $7.6 billion offer for NI Corp public after rebuffed approachesMicrosoft stock slips as Guggenheim downgrades to Sell]"

I think it's because when he got the medicine he already had the virus for a week,"" Li told Reuters on Jan.12.""Now we can do little but pray.""His father died the same day.Li's experience, local media reports and online posts bear testimony to the difficulties faced obtaining Paxlovid in China through official channels.Paxlovid - a combination of two anti viral drugs - is one of the few foreign oral treatments approved by Beijing and a clinical trial has found it to have reduced hospitalisations in high-risk patients by around 90%.Having been approved in February last year, Paxlovid was scarcely used in China until December when the government started lifting its strict containment policy, and wave of COVID infections began to build.Story continuesRAMPING UP SUPPLIESChinese authorities have acknowledged that supplies of Paxlovid are still insufficient to meet demand, even as Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said last week that thousands of courses of the treatment were shipped to the country last year and in the past couple of weeks millions more were shipped.""Pfizer is actively collaborating with Chinese authorities and all stakeholders to secure an adequate supply of Paxlovid in China. We remain committed to fulfilling the COVID-19 treatment needs of Chinese patients and partnering with the Chinese government,"" the company said in a statement.Racing to defend against a rising death toll, China has also approved Merck &amp; Co's COVID antiviral drug and is reviewing a treatment developed by Japan's Shionogi.Paxlovid is covered by state insurance -- albeit temporarily until the end of March -- meaning patients in theory would only need to pay 198 yuan ($29), a tenth of its usual price.But China doesn't provide data on how many treatment courses are supplied and where it can be purchased, forcing most patients to rely on media reports, word-of-mouth or even importing through unauthorised channels in the grey market.Those who do manage to find a supplier often end up paying exorbitant prices, as demand has shot up amid a giant wave of COVID-19 infections.The official Guangzhou Daily reported in late December that most patients at the United Family Healthcare hospital in Guangdong were paying up to 6,000 yuan ($885.50) before being allowed to get Paxlovid priced at 2,300 yuan at the hospital.The hospital told Reuters on Wednesday that the report is ""misleading,"" as the drug can be bought for 1,850 yuan from the hospital and most patients need to pay a medical consultation fee of up to 2,000 yuan.Health data firm Airfinity estimated in December that China would need 49 million courses of the COVID treatment over the next five months, with over 22 million needed in January alone.The Pfizer drug can be also purchased for 2,170 yuan with prescription via online platforms, but it typically sells out within seconds.PAXLOVID GIFTSeveral other people described to Reuters how they turned to the grey market to purchase Paxlovid. Some were looking to treat sick relatives, while others wanted it just in case.Chen Jun, a resident of China's southern Hainan Province, said he bought Paxlovid from a supplier introduced by a business partner, who said the medicine was coming from Hong Kong.Chen paid 20,000 yuan ($2,972) on Jan. 2 for two boxes for his elderly parents, who suffer from cancer, and he said that some people had paid double that price.""You'll think it cheap once your family members are in need, because anything is better than going to a hospital now,"" he said. ""I know people who paid 20,000 yuan for one box of the medicine.""Another buyer who gave his name as Ray said he managed to get two boxes from the United States, where supplies are still ample and a doctor's prescription can be obtained after an online consultation.""It's very straightforward, they don't ask questions,"" he said. Having made the online purchase, he then asked a friend there to help courier it to China.An analyst at a Chinese securities house, who requested anonymity because of sensitivities over the subject, said his boss went to Hong Kong to stock up on Paxlovid to gift clients as it was more valued than a popular, expensive liquor.""It is a better gift than Moutai.""

The disease surged in the United States and Europe this fall alongside the flu and COVID-19.There is currently no vaccine for the virus in adults. Moderna, Pfizer Inc and GSK Plc are racing to get their RSV vaccines to market first.Pfizer and GSK filed applications for U.S. regulatory approval late last year. Pfizer's RSV vaccine was found to be 66.7% effective against two or more symptoms in late-stage trials. On the other hand, Sanofi and partner AstraZeneca Plc's antibody treatment nirsevimab has gained the European Commission's marketing authorization for the prevention of RSV in newborns and infants. It is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Moderna said it intends to submit its vaccine, mRNA-1345, for regulatory approval consideration globally in the first half of 2023.The company's president, Stephen Hoge, told Reuters that its vaccine appears to compare favorably to the experimental Pfizer and GSK shots.""It's very exciting to see progress in RSV vaccines in older adults, and I think both of those vaccines have shown pretty remarkable results as well,"" Hoge said. ""We really think we're in that top class - 84% is a terrific efficacy number.""The RSV vaccine market could be worth more than $10 billion globally, half of which would come from the United States, according to Cowen analyst Tyler Van Buren.Moderna's study was conducted in about 37,000 participants aged 60 years and older. The data analysis was performed after 64 participants contracted RSV. The company plans to release the full data at a medical meeting.Hoge said Moderna had started secondary analyses on the vaccine's efficacy against more severe disease and hospitalization. He said it was too early to provide a potential price range for the vaccine it expects to be given annually.The vaccine was generally found to be safe, with the most common side effects including injection-site pain, fatigue and headache. Hoge said there were no concerns of myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation linked to mRNA COVID vaccines.

At its current share price, WWE has a market cap closer to $6.7 billion.""While no potential strategics have commented, we think there will be reasonable interest from the likes of NFLX, AMZN, and CMCSA since WWE provides lots of hours of content and has a dedicated audience,"" Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall said.""Ultimately, we think NFLX would rather pick-up a night of WWE rights vs the whole company.

EDR's stock is down more than 21% since its 2021 debut.Story continuesGreenfield listed Fox (FOXA), Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), and Comcast (CMCSA) as other possibilities, especially as the appetite for sports rights ramps up in the media and tech space.The analyst said Disney ""would excite us the most"" as the company, ""could use WWE’s content globally across its streaming and legacy media assets (most notably the US and India), build its presence within its theme parks and sell merchandise around the world as only Disney can.""Last Tuesday, WWE co-CEO Stephanie McMahon — also Vince McMahon's daughter — resigned from her role, leaving Nick Khan as the sole CEO of the company.—With additional reporting from Brian Sozzi Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

In the meantime, stablecoins, which are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to real-world assets such as gold or the U.S. dollar, are working as “stopgaps until CBDCS are available in the market.”Rob Massey, global tax leader, blockchain and cryptocurrency at Deloitte, echoed Nagarajan's comments in a separate segment on “First Mover.” He said the ability to use programmable money with smart contracts can reduce friction and “help large-scale enterprises elevate their level of transparency and real-time payment systems.”“It’s absolutely where we’re going,” Massey said, although he cautioned that not all CBDCs, stablecoins and smart-contract protocols “are created equal.”Read more: Bank of America Says CBDCs Are the Future of Money and Payments]"

And one of the debates here and really everywhere is whether the US and the global economy is going to enter a recession or not. How much is it going to slow down? Let's talk to someone about that, that is Gary Cohn. He is the Vice Chair at IBM, and of course, former Head of the Council of Economic Advisors for the Trump Administration.And so, Gary, what are you seeing? What are you hearing? I mean you wear a lot of hats as always. You talk to a lot of people as always. What's the vibe?GARY COHN: Well, the vibe here, because everyone is fairly on the bearish side. Everyone's talking about global recessions. Everyone's talking about recessions. But of course, when I talk to people and ask them about their business, they seem to think their business is OK. So everyone here seems to think the other person has a problem.My personal view on this is, I think we've weathered the storm in the United States. It feels like we're coming out in a fairly decent place. I do think the Fed will probably raise another couple of 25 basis points. They're not quite done yet. I don't think they want to walk away. I think they want to put the nail in the coffin on inflation.But all the data shows that inflation is coming down relatively quickly. And we still see pretty positive economic data. We still see employment growth. We still see GDP in a relatively good position. So I'm still cautiously optimistic going into next year. And so I'm clearly in the more bullish camp for those here in Davos.- Were you surprised Gary by some of your former peers in the banking industry calling out last week and then also today as well a mild recession?Story continuesGARY COHN: I'm not surprised. If you're running a big bank and you're running a big business, I think you have to think about that as a possibility. You have to run your business being prepared for the worst. And if we don't go to a mild recession and we don't have that, it's surely a lot easier to run your business having prepared for that than not having prepared for that. So I understand the mentality.- Would this be a Federal Reserve driven recession?GARY COHN: I'm not going to say it's a Federal Reserve driven recession. We clearly had inflation. We clearly had a major supply chain disruption coming out of COVID. We could go through the history. During COVID, we became a purely goods economy. The only thing that was driving the economy were things that the United States Postal Service, UPS, or FedEx could deliver to your house.And so we had this massive demand on goods. And so the supply chain broke down. As we reopen the economy, no one had labor. And we changed from our natural goods economy, to our natural supply side economy, excuse me, where we really consume-- we really consume services.So we're an 80% service as economy in the United States. But when we went out to start consuming our natural services, no one had workers. So everyone scrambled to get labor back. And it was tough to get labor back in the economy.So we saw quite a bit of wage inflation and we're still seeing the wage inflation as people are out still trying to enjoy themselves and make up for the lost time that they lost during COVID. You still see the airlines, you still see the hotels, the restaurants are still thriving and trying to hire people back, as we revert back to our more service driven economy.- So, I guess then the question is, it makes sense CEOs are pessimistic because they have to manage their businesses. They have to have an eye on worst case scenarios. What about the markets, though? Because there too, you could argue, especially the bond market is looking for maybe even cuts by the end of the year, which would imply that the economy is going to be doing worse and going to need those cuts. Do they have it wrong?GARY COHN: So I don't know where rates are today. It's when you're in Davos, you get out of touch.- We were talking about how isolated we are.GARY COHN: We're in a bubble. Well, I think, I guess the US markets aren't open. So they're open. Total bubble. But the 10 year in the US is trading 360ish. I'll give you an ish. Normally, I would know exactly.So and we've got a front end Fed fund rate at 4 and 1/2%, probably going to 4 and 3/4%, 5%. So the Treasury market is discounting what's ultimately going to happen in the economy. And the market is sort of voicing its opinion, I think, relatively strongly. I think the market's right.At the end of the day, as I always say to people, you can trade the market. Billions and trillions of dollars are wagered in the Treasury market every day. And people are expressing their views and you can express your view and you'll be right or wrong, based on your opinion. The Treasury has-- sorry, the Fed--- By the way, I got a little tip in my ear. It's 3 and 1/2% today.GARY COHN: OK.- So a little lower.GARY COHN: So we're down from where we were last. Week so think about that. So rates are even lower than they were last week. So the Fed on the other hand, they can talk. They can raise Fed funds. They can raise the overnight rate. They can control what people get on overnight funding. But that's the only part of the curve they can control.Yes, they can use extraordinary measures. And they can do twists. And they can do QE and they can do QT. But ultimately their real opportunity is to control the front end of the curve. And I think the curve is speaking for itself right now to what people are saying about the US economy.- We have this term, I'm sure you know this, that a stock is dead money if a company is not executing. If some of that is invested in blockchain and even crypto, is Bitcoin dead money here? Do you even touch that? Do you go near it at all?GARY COHN: So I have not invested.- Not invested in crypto.GARY COHN: Not invested in crypto. I want to make that very clear.- But you're a blockchain guy.GARY COHN: I've invested in blockchain. I think blockchain as a tool is a very interesting tool. It's a tool that will modernize the financial services industry. You know, I lived through the revolution of clearing and how we put everything through-- one of the solutions to the financial crisis was to clear everything.So we went from clearing the most liquid items in the world to clearing everything. I think blockchain is a further evolution on the clearing house, and it's being able to real time clear things and move title instantaneously and move cash instantaneously. So I'm bullish on blockchain. On crypto I really don't have a view.- Do we sort of need to like reputationally, do we need to divorce blockchain from crypto?GARY COHN: 100%.- Because it's a technology, right?GARY COHN: It is a technology.- And it can be used in so many other things.- Look at me. I just lumped it right in together.- Yeah, no, no.- But so how do you do that as an investor in it, as someone who wants it to go further. How do you get it to people to sort of separate the two?GARY COHN: Blockchain, think of blockchain as the clearinghouse. We don't talk about the clearinghouse. You don't even know who clears-- the clearinghouse. And you don't even know about DTCC. You don't know where the securities are settled. We don't talk about the settlement agency.- You don't need to. Most people don't need to.GARY COHN: You don't need to. You talk about the individual securities. Bitcoin is the security. It is actually a security. And there's many other securities. People have created other cryptocurrencies. You can talk about them. But the blockchain is actually the underlying infrastructure that allows these securities to be transacted and to be settled in real time.- Gary, you came in at an interesting time for IBM, a lot of transformation at the company, new CEO Arvind Krishna. Investors still seem doubtful on a turnaround. Where it is IBM on that turnaround plan?GARY COHN: Look, I think Arvind has laid out a very distinct plan on revenue growth, on free cash flow growth, and he continues to execute upon his plan.- And what are you doing there, for lack of a better question? You know, like what do you see as your role there, and how do you help with the strategy that he has laid out?GARY COHN: Look, I came in a couple of years ago when Arvind came in as the new chairman and CEO. He asked me to come in and help him think about his strategy, think about his senior management team, think about what IBM of the future should look like, help them with clients, help them with client relationships. And it's been a really interesting experience to learn about the technology world and the evolution.IBM is still on the forefront of cutting edge technology, which is extraordinary. It's a whole new world for me to learn. And it's been a really interesting and fascinating couple of years.- Great. Gary Cohn, thank you so much for being here, vice chair at IBM, the aforementioned.GARY COHN: Thank you for having me.- Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. And we will be back with more, of course. But right now keep it tuned right here on Yahoo Finance.]"

Major stock indexes have recorded two consecutive weeks of gains.A lower wage rate and a contraction in the services sector PMI raised hopes that inflation is cooling in the desired direction. At the same time, market participants remained optimistic that a resilient labor market would enable the Fed with a soft landing of the economy.At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in high dividend paying U.S. corporate behemoths with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies have a strong business model, a solid financial position and globally recognized brand value. A favorable Zacks Rank indicates near-term upside potential of the stocks and high dividend yields should provide a regular income stream.Immediate CatalystsThe Department of Labor reported that the nonfarm payroll increased 223,000 in December beating the consensus estimate of 208,000. However, December’s job additions fell below November’s data that were revised downward to 256,000 from 263,000 reported earlier.Hourly wage rate increased 0.3% in December below the consensus estimate of 0.4%. November’s data was revised downward to 0.4% from 0.6% reported earlier. Year over year,  the hourly wage rate increased 4.6% in December compared with the consensus estimate of 5%. The wage rate increased 4.8% year over year in November.Peak inflation seems behind us. Less-than-expected inflation rates in October and November with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this.The Institute of Supply Management reported that the services sector index for December plummeted to 49.6% in December from 56.5% in November. The consensus estimate was 55.1%. Any reading below 50% indicates a contraction in services activities. The index contracted for the first time since May 2020, at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.A devastated housing market owing to the high mortgage rate, disappointing retail sales in December, the peak festive season, huge inventory accumulation by several retailers, a stiff fall in U.S. manufacturing activities and a good chunk of manpower retrenchment by several U.S. corporate giants indicated that the U.S. economy is cooling in the desired direction of the Fed.Story continuesConsumer Sentiment Data Indicates Inflation Will EaseThe University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 13 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a preliminary reading of 4.0% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021. At the five-year horizon, the outlook rose to 3.0% from 2.9% last month, staying within the range of 2.9%-3.1% for 17 of the last 18 months.Per the report, consumers believe that price pressures will ease considerably over the next 12 months, with the one-year inflation outlook falling in January to the lowest level since the spring of 2021. Consequently, consumers spirits are getting a boost. The University of Michigan's preliminary January reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment came in at 64.6%, up from 59.7% in the prior month.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate bigwigs (market capital &gt; $50 billion) with a current dividend yield of &gt; 2%.

While the 6.2 liter V8 powers the rear wheels, the front axle is connected to an electric motor that can give the Corvette “eAWD” as Chevrolet calls it.

The non-plug-in, mild hybrid system uses a 1.9 kWh battery pack.All told, the the electrified powertrain will send the E-Ray from 0-60 mph in a brisk 2.5 seconds, with the quarter-mile coming in at 10.5 seconds. Both of these figures are 0.1 seconds quicker than the top-of-the-line Corvette Z06.The Corvette E-Ray with eAWD shown driving in the snow.In addition, the E-Ray features a “stealth mode,” as Chevrolet calls it, allowing the car to operate in electric mode on the street up to speeds of 45 mph.

Chevrolet also says the E-Ray’s Active Fuel Management system uses the electric motor to extend 4-cylinder operation in different driving conditions.Chevrolet did not release any estimated figures on mileage or electric-only range.

GM executives have said previously a gasoline-electric hybrid version of the automaker's supercar was coming.The Corvette E-Ray will use a 12-volt lithium-ion battery and a 160-horsepower electric motor to drive the front wheels. A 495-horsepower, gasoline-fueled V-8 engine will drive the back wheels as in other Corvettes. GM said the hybrid system will accelerate the E-Ray to 60 miles per hour in 2.5 seconds, making it the quickest production Corvette ever, GM said.The E-Ray will also be able to operate in a battery-only ""stealth mode"" for short distances, GM said.The E-Ray is the first Corvette equipped with all-wheel drive. Many rear-drive Corvettes spend winters in their owners' garages.The E-Ray is a derivative of the current Corvette and does not use GM's latest, Ultium battery technology, GM executives told reporters in a briefing. A fully electric Corvette will come, but GM executives are not saying when.The E-Ray is scheduled to go into production later this year at a starting price of $104,205.(Reporting by Joe White in Detroit; Editing by Matthew Lewis)]"

The Nasdaq Composite dropped 138.10 points, or 1.24%, to 10,957.01.Wednesday's decline was Nasdaq's first loss in eight sessions while the S&amp;P and the down both saw their biggest daily percentage declines since Dec. 15.With Wall Street's major averages showing gains so far for 2023, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA research, said some investors saw weak data as an opportunity to take profits.""The market was overbought. Today's economic data served as a trigger to initiate a profit taking spell and the groups with most profits to take have been the ones that have done best last year,"" said Stovall.The weakest sectors on Wednesday were the defensive consumer staples, down 2.7%, and utilities, which fell 2.4%. In comparison, the best performers were more growth heavy sectors such as communications services, down 0.9%, and technology, down 1.3%.Story continuesEarlier in the day, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester stressed on the need to raise rates beyond 5% to bring inflation to heel.And late in the afternoon, Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said that he expects the Fed to raise rates a few more times this year although he reiterated earlier comments that he's ready for the U.S. central bank to move to a slower pace of rate hikes due to signs of cooling inflation.The Fed commentary also highlighted the disparity between the U.S. central bank's estimate of its terminal rate and market expectations, which were of the rate peaking at 4.88% by June. Traders are now betting on a 25-basis point rate hike in February.Investors are also focused on the fourth-quarter earnings season as a window into how corporate America is doing against the backdrop of higher interest rates.Analysts now expect year-over-year earnings from S&amp;P 500 companies to decline 2.6% for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data, compared with a 1.6% decline in the beginning of the year.Moderna Inc shares rose 3.3% after reporting data which demonstrated the effectiveness of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.PNC Financial Services Group Inc shares tumbled 6% after it missed estimates for its fourth-quarter profit.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.88-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.98-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&amp;P 500 posted nine new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 78 new highs and 20 new lows.On U.S. exchanges 11.76 billion shares changed hands on Wednesday compared with the 10.45 billion average for the last 20 sessions.(Reporting by Sinéad Carew in New York, Shreyashi Sanyal and Amruta Khandekar in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Shubham Batra; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and David Gregorio)]"

(ISRG) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.26 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.1%.Revenues are expected to be $1.66 billion, up 6.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Intuitive Surgical, Inc.For Intuitive Surgical, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.69%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Would post earnings of $1.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.19, delivering a surprise of +8.18%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

CHH is benefiting from expansion efforts, acquisition, loyalty program and solid growth of its Cambria Brand. Improving RevPAR is also aiding the company’s growth.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 11.6%. The company’s sales and earnings in 2023 are expected to witness growth of 8.9% and 13.3%, respectively.Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversChoice Hotels relies heavily on expansion in domestic and international markets. In third-quarter 2022, the company awarded 123 domestic franchise agreements (representing 10,551 rooms) compared with 89 franchise agreements reported in the prior-year quarter. CHH reported sequential increases in its business and group travel demand, driven by a rise in extended vacations, household relocations and temporary remote work assignments.Coming to the extended-stay portfolio, the company witnessed rapid expansion, reaching 468 domestic hotels as of Sep 30, 2022. This marked an increase of 45% on a year-over-year basis. During the third quarter of 2022, the company unveiled its first extended-stay hotel in Corona, CA.Along with domestic growth, the company continues to expand its international footprint in new countries. Key international operating markets include Spain, Colombia, the Caribbean and Canada.Relatively new to the midscale portfolio, Clarion Pointe — part of the popular Clarion brand, is experiencing great success. Clarion Point brand resonates well with guests. The brand has 50 hotels open in the United States and 10 additional hotels awaiting conversion this year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company is also focusing on its loyalty program to drive growth. During third-quarter 2021, the company announced a collaboration with a trusted digital-asset marketplace – Bakkt. The initiative enables Choice Privileges loyalty members to unlock new redemption opportunities by converting their rewards points to cash and for purchasing Bitcoin.Also, it allows guests to transfer their points to a friend or even redeem them online or in-store through Apple Pay and Google Pay. Backed by solid revenue contributions along with new customer additions, the company remains optimistic for growth in the upcoming periods.CHH is gaining from acquisition of Radisson Hospitality. During third-quarter 2022, the addition of the Radisson upscale brands increased Choice's global footprint in the upscale segment to over 74,000 rooms. The Radisson Americas portfolio contributed $40.2 million to total revenues and $6.8 million in adjusted EBITDA.Given growth prospects with respect to penetration in the upscale market and value creation efforts, the company is optimistic in this regard. The acquisition-backed enhancements with respect to the company’s long-term asset-light strategy (of growing its business in higher revenue travel segments and locations) and strengthening of Cambria’s growth prospects are likely to add to the positives.As of Sep 30, 2022, the Radisson Hotels Americas brands had 69 franchised hotels with 8,756 rooms under construction, awaiting conversion or approval for development in its global system.Shares of the company have increased 7.4% in the past six months compared with the industry’s increase of 15.5%.Story continuesKey PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

MHK provided an update on its fourth-quarter 2022 outlook for adjusted EPS. Since its last quarter's earnings release on Oct 27, 2022, the company witnessed interest rate hike pressure, along with high inflation and lagging consumer confidence in the United States and Europe markets. This resulted in more softness in the global residential flooring business than MHK expected.Due to this, Mohawk continued with temporary plant shutdowns, which negatively impacted margins and quarterly results. Also, weak demand in Flooring North America forced Mohawk to reduce its inventory levels. Due to these factors, the company expects fourth-quarter adjusted EPS between $1.27 and $1.31, excluding any restructuring or other one-time charges. Earlier, it anticipated adjusted EPS of $1.40-$1.50, excluding any restructuring charges. In fourth-quarter 2021, the metric totaled $2.95 per share. It plans to release its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 9.Apart from this, it signed a contract with plaintiffs to resolve the previously disclosed securities class action lawsuit. Initially filed on Jan 3, 2020, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, this lawsuit could be protracted, burdensome and expensive.Additionally, Mohawk settled a previously disclosed dispute with the Belgian Tax Authority (“BTA”) regarding the tax treatment of royalty income arising from intellectual property. In April 2022, the BTA issued a tax assessment of €187 million (including penalties but excluding interest) for 2013-2018. Although Mohawk believes its tax position in Belgium is correct, it entered an agreement with the BTA on Nov 23, 2022, to settle the dispute for a one-time payment of €3 million.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have declined 28.5% in the past year compared with the Zacks Textile - Home Furnishing industry’s 30.8% fall.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for SBA Communications SBA Communications' Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. To the delight of shareholders, SBA Communications has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 46%, compound, over the last three years. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Our analysis has highlighted that SBA Communications' revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. EBIT margins for SBA Communications remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 13% to US$2.5b. That's a real positive.Story continuesIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of SBA Communications' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are SBA Communications Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since SBA Communications has a market capitalisation of US$33b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$385m. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like SBA Communications, the median CEO pay is around US$13m.SBA Communications' CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$10.0m in the year leading up to December 2021. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Does SBA Communications Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?SBA Communications' earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. The cherry on top is that insiders own a bucket-load of shares, and the CEO pay seems really quite reasonable. The drastic earnings growth indicates the business is going from strength to strength. Hopefully a trend that continues well into the future. Big growth can make big winners, so the writing on the wall tells us that SBA Communications is worth considering carefully. Still, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with SBA Communications.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $318.91 million.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Hancock Whitney: favorable.

European shares climbed after a string of positive earnings updates.Europe's STOXX 600 index rose to its highest level since April 2022.Three factors have propelled stock markets higher, Andreas Bruckner, european equity strategist at BofA Global Research, said.These were an expectation for a dovish pivot from the U.S. Federal Reserve, economic data that showed companies working overtime to deal with order backlogs, and China's economy re-opening faster than expected from COVID-19 lockdowns.""But the sugar high that markets are on will eventually disappear because it will be impossible to mask an underlying weakness in economic demand,"" said Bruckner.London's FTSE 100 scaled a fresh 4-1/2-year high after the latest UK inflation numbers, although worries over tight monetary policy remained as the rate hovered in double-digit territory.The internationally focused FTSE 100 edged 0.1% higher. The pan-European STOXX 600 was 0.2% higher, boosted by rate-sensitive technology stocks, while U.S. stock futures were mixed.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan rose 0.4%.JAPANThe market spotlight was also on Japan, where the yen slid and government bond yields fell the most in two decades at one point, retreating sharply from the central bank's 0.5% ceiling after policymakers decided to keep yield curve controls in place.The 10-year yield plunged as much as 14 basis points to 0.36% at its lowest point, which would have been the biggest one-day decline since September 2003, before edging back up to 0.43% as of 1024 GMT. The yield was at 0.51% prior to the Bank of Japan decision.Story continuesIn a Reuters poll, 97% of economists expected the BOJ to maintain its ultra-easy policy at the meeting.""It was a tough day for the bond vigilantes who were positioned to bully the BOJ into a policy change not justified by their economic forecasts,"" said Sean Callow, a senior currency strategist at Westpac.The dollar was up 1% at 12.953 yen but well off session highs.The dollar index, which measures the safe-haven dollar against six peers, rose 0.4%. It has been undermined lately by falling U.S. bond yields as markets wager the Federal Reserve can be less aggressive in hiking rates.The pound rose over 0.4% and the euro gained 0.6%.ENERGY PRICE RALLYOil prices rose on Wednesday, extending the previous session's gains, driven by optimism that the lifting of China's strict COVID-19 curbs will lead to a recovery in fuel demand in the world's top oil importer.Brent crude LCOc1 futures vaulted 1.30%, to $87.03 a barrel by 1025 GMT, following a 1.7% rally in the previous session.In less than three weeks of 2023, foreign buying of Chinese stocks has exceeded last year's total as investors bet on the country's rapid recovery after COVID-19 lockdowns were lifted.China's Vice Premier Liu He said he welcomed foreign investment and declared his country open to the world after three years of pandemic isolation.Data on Tuesday showed China's economic growth had slumped in 2022 to 3.0% - the weakest rate in nearly half a century.Spot gold rose over 0.2% to $1,913 per ounce., while copper prices touched seven-month highs.Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 0.9% at $9,367.50 a tonne.

A global stocks index also fell.Some investors said the drop in U.S. retail sales, together with subsiding inflation, could encourage the Fed to further scale back the pace of its interest rate increases next month.A separate report showed U.S. producer prices also fell more than expected in December.Even as inflation was showing signs of cooling, Fed policymakers reiterated their support for hiking the U.S. central bank's target interest rate above 5%.The U.S. central bank is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points when it concludes its two-day meeting on Feb. 1.Earlier, the Bank of Japan maintained its ultra-easy policy, including a bond yield cap, defying market expectations it would phase out its massive stimulus program because of increasing inflation pressures.The decision caused the yen to fall, with investors unwinding bets based on expectations the central bank would overhaul its yield control policy.In late-afternoon U.S. trading, the dollar was up 0.6% against the yen.

The peso, among the top performing EM currencies so far this year, rose 0.5% to 18.68 per dollar - its strongest level since February 2020. Bank of Mexico board member Jonathan Heath said he did not see any interest rate cuts happening in the next six months, in an interview with Bloomberg published Monday. ""Several metrics such as the real-effective exchange rate are beginning to suggest that the Mexican peso is becoming relatively expensive,"" said analysts at Scotiabank. ""We believe that an exchange rate move could be the catalyst for a rebound in investment as global bargain hunters swoop in."" Broadly, stock markets and currencies in resource-rich Latin America rose as prices of commodities including oil and copper rallied on hopes that a shift in China's COVID-19 policy will boost consumption. Brazil's Bovespa climbed 1.9%, with oil major Petrobras and miner Vale driving gains. ""We see the backdrop for EM assets turning more positive as EM rates peak, DM central banks pause, the U.S. dollar weakens and China reopens,"" strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute told clients. ""By contrast, the damage of higher rates has yet to fully materialize in DM."" Data earlier showed New York state manufacturing contracted sharply in January, pointing to continued weakness in national factory activity, hurt by the Fed's fastest interest rate hiking cycle since the 1980s. Brazil's real was up 0.8% against a broadly weakening dollar. Data showed inflation in Brazil as measured by the IGP-10 price index rose 0.05% in January, compared with a 0.36% gain in December. The real has made a volatile start to the year after a solid performance in 2022 on concerns about the new government's fiscal measures. Brazil's Finance Minister Fernando Haddad said on Monday it was ""very realistic"" to end this year with a primary budget deficit of 1% of gross domestic product. Chile's peso gained 0.8% to hover near seven-month highs, while Colombia's peso slipped about 0.9%. There is no need to further raise Colombia's benchmark interest rate - which is at a 23-year high of 12% - despite still-elevated inflation, the finance minister said.

To find the Best Markets for First-time Homebuyers, Realtor.com® looked at a number of qualities that make a town attractive, including affordability, livability and where it might be easier for young buyers to break into the housing market. The top 10 markets for first-time homebuyers in 2023 are: Portsmouth, Va., DeForest, Wisc., Windsor Locks, Conn., Gloucester City, N.J., Moore, Okla., Magna, Utah, Eggertsville, N.Y., Watervliet, N.Y., Mattydale, N.Y. and Somersworth, N.H.Realtor.com® Forecasts the 10 Best Markets for First-Time Homebuyers in 2023What makes these towns great for first-time buyers? They have strong job markets, short commute times, plenty of places to eat and drink, a younger population, affordability, and more homes to choose from.""The housing market will continue to be challenging for first-time buyers in the coming year, but for those with a bit of flexibility in where they live, there are markets where young buyers can find not just a relatively affordable home, but a neighborhood that offers a mix of economic opportunity and lifestyle amenities,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""Affordability is always a consideration for first-time buyers, but it's also important to make sure that you're settling down in a location that has all the qualities that make it an enjoyable place to live – after all, you're not just buying a house, you're investing in a community.""This year's best markets have:More homes to choose from: With inventory still near historic lows, having more homes to choose from can make a world of difference. Realtor.com®'s best markets for first-time homebuyers have an average of 47.8 listings per 1,000 households, higher than the national rate of 45.2. Magna, Utah has the widest selection of listings per household on this year's list.Short commutes: Typically, the farther from city centers, the cheaper the homes, but no one wants to spend all day commuting. This year's top towns have an average expected commute time of just 24 minutes. This is significantly faster than the national average of 30 minutes–it would save 50 hours per year for a 5-day commuter. Those looking for an especially short commute should check out Eggertsville, N.Y., which has an average travel time of just 20 minutes.Options for food and drinks: Buying a house doesn't need to mean giving up on a latte or an occasional meal out. The top towns have an average of 5.6 food and drink establishments per 1,000 households in their metro area, higher than the national rate of 5.3. Somersworth, N.H. topped the list for proximity to restaurants.Younger residents: When it comes to picking a new community, younger buyers are often drawn to younger towns. This year's list has an average of 14.8% of residents in the 25-34 year age category, compared to the national average of 13.4%. Magna, Utah (which also made the 2022 list) tied Moore, Okla. as the youngest markets on the list.Affordability: With high home prices and interest rates, affordability is a key factor for first-time homebuyers. The best markets offer an average 2022 listing price to income ratio of 3.5 for 25- 34 year-olds, much lower than the national rate of 5.1. Mattydale, N.Y. and Gloucester City, N.J. tied for the most affordable locations on the list.Strong housing markets: A home is an investment, and this is especially true for first-time buyers who are likely investing a large portion of their savings into a home. To help best protect that investment, it's important to buy in a location that has a strong local housing market and is likely to hold its value, if not appreciate. This year's markets are located within metro areas that have an average forecasted 2023 home sales growth rate of 1.2%, higher than the national rate which is expected to decline -14.1%. In terms of price growth, Somersworth, N.H. is located within the Boston metro area which is expected to have the highest growth in 2023 among the 10 places on our list (+9.5%), followed closely by the Madison metro area containing DeForest, Wisc.(+9.0%).Story continuesRealtor.com® 2023 Best Markets for First-Time HomebuyersRankPlace NameMetro Name2023 Metro Forecast Rank2023 Forecasted 25-34 Year Old Population Share12 Month Ending November 2022 Inventory per 1,000 Households12 Month Ending November 2022 Price to Income Ratio2023 Forecasted Metro UnemploymentRate (%)2020 Food and Drink Establishments per 1,000 Households2023 Forecasted Average Travel Time to Work2023 Metro Forecasted Price Growth2023 MetroForecasted Sales Growth1Portsmouth, Va.Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, Va.-N.C.2115.9 %58.83.93.45.5255.1 %3.9 %2DeForest, Wisc.Madison, Wisc.5615.1 %58.13.62.85.5259.0 %-5.0 %3Windsor Locks, Conn.Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, Conn.112.6 %41.92.73.75.7238.5 %6.5 %4Gloucester City, N.J.Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, Penn.-N.J.-Del.-Md.4313.6 %62.32.23.75.6255.7 %0.6 %5Moore, OklaOklahoma City, Okla3616.8 %54.73.03.15.3272.6 %4.2 %6Magna, UtahSalt Lake City, Utah7316.8 %73.75.12.45.6275.8 %-7.6 %7Eggertsville, N.Y.Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls, N.Y.513.3 %39.03.43.95.4206.0 %6.3 %8Watervliet, N.Y.Albany-Schenectady-Troy, N.Y.2815.9 %18.34.03.35.8224.7 %3.0 %9Mattydale, N.Y.Syracuse, N.Y.3312.9 %40.92.23.65.3216.1 %0.9 %10Somersworth, N.H.Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Mass-N.H.2214.9 %30.14.62.86.2289.5 %-0.6 %USA13.4 %44.95.14.05.3305.4 %-14.1 % Home shoppers can visit Realtor.com® to learn about the process, see if they might be eligible for down payment assistance and find out how much they can afford.

260,45a1182f-af79-312d-8aa3-9ea09ba6b604,VZ,2023-01-18,Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) investors are sitting on a loss of 22% if they invested three years ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-nyse-vz-investors-120027940.html,1674043227,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 10% in the last quarter. But that doesn't help the fact that the three year return is less impressive. After all, the share price is down 32% in the last three years, significantly under-performing the market.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Although the share price is down over three years, Verizon Communications actually managed to grow EPS by 5.7% per year in that time. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.Given the healthiness of the dividend payments, we doubt that they've concerned the market. Verizon Communications has maintained its top line over three years, so we doubt that has shareholders worried. A closer look at revenue and profit trends might yield insights.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. If you are thinking of buying or selling Verizon Communications stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Verizon Communications' TSR for the last 3 years was -22%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 13% in the twelve months, Verizon Communications shareholders did even worse, losing 19% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.0% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Verizon Communications better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Verizon Communications .There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

VZ is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results before the opening bell on Jan 24. In the last reported quarter, the telecom giant beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. The company is expected to have recorded higher aggregate revenues year over year, buoyed by the positive momentum in its core wireless business.Factors at PlayDuring the fourth quarter, Verizon continued to deploy 100 MHz of C-Band spectrum to further expand its 5G coverage and covered more than 175 million people with 5G Ultra Wideband service. The company is witnessing significant 5G adoption and fixed wireless broadband momentum while increasing demand for premium mobility and broadband offerings instill optimism. It extended its high-speed fiber Internet across additional homes in Massachusetts. These are likely to get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.Verizon offered customers the Welcome Unlimited plan with unlimited talk, text and data on its 5G Nationwide network for just $25 per line per month for four lines. It also launched new Prepaid Unlimited plans for as low as $50 per month, including free access to Disney+ for six months. In addition to the new Unlimited plans, Verizon Prepaid offered a new 15GB data plan for as low as $35 per month with Auto Pay. These developments are likely to have had a positive impact on Verizon’s performance.During the quarter, Verizon collaborated with Higi to provide digital health solutions and services to support preventative health, drive literacy and identify high-risk consumers eligible to be managed via home-based monitoring. It also partnered with Openloop to accelerate anytime, anywhere virtual care delivery. According to the terms of the collaboration, the firms will work in unison to provide rural communities and seniors with limited access to transportation with greater access to care powered by the Verizon 4G LTE and 5G Ultra Wideband networks. These initiatives are likely to have translated into incremental revenues in the quarter.In the fourth quarter, Verizon inked an agreement with Wipro Limited to develop global Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) for network modernization and cloud transformation for businesses with a range of pre-configured and tested service chains on a subscription-based consumption model. However, adverse foreign currency translations and high operating costs for 5G deployments are likely to have led to soft margins in the quarter. The infrastructure investments are expected to have weighed on the margins.For the December quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $35,150 million. It reported revenues of $34,067 million in the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share stands at $1.21, which suggests a decline from the year-ago tally of $1.31.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Verizon for the fourth quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -2.39%, with the former pegged at $1.18 and the latter at $1.21.

264,a6cae984-f6ed-35d4-8e33-6e9b66f9d2bb,VZ,2023-01-18,Verizon Communications (VZ) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-vz-expected-beat-150003751.html,1673967603,STORY,['VZ'],"[The market expects Verizon Communications (VZ) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis largest U.S. cellphone carrier is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.21 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -7.6%.Revenues are expected to be $35.15 billion, up 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.94% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model — the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Verizon?For Verizon, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.42%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Verizon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Verizon would post earnings of $1.28 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.32, delivering a surprise of +3.13%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Verizon appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Upgrades:double capacity on the network, allowing more customers to do more things with their wireless phones; decrease latency, making activities on phones more responsive; and enable future growth of additional cell sites in the areaSILVER VALLEY, Idaho, Jan. 17, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Residents and visitors in the Silver Valley area of Northern Idaho just got a boost to their network service. Verizon engineers recently completed an upgrade to the cell sites serving the area, deploying fiber cables to move data from local cell towers through the rest of the network. This upgrade doubles the amount of data cell sites can process, meaning more customers can connect to the network at the same time and can do more when they are connected - stream more movies, send more emails, and video conference with friends, family and colleagues more seamlessly. The upgrade also lowers latency for customers, meaning their devices will be faster to connect and respond, and it lays the infrastructure for additional cell sites coming to the area in the future.“We know our customers rely on our network for work, for fun and to stay connected to the world around them,” said Phillip French, Vice President of Network Engineering and Assurance at Verizon. “Our goal is to provide them with the best possible service using the most advanced technology available. This is one of many steps we’re taking to provide excellent service to the Silver Valley area and we have much more planned for customers in this area.”Fiber cables offer a far better way to move vast amounts of data across long distances quickly and economically. Fiber not only provides far greater capacity than past connections, it is more reliable, can manage packet-based IP, the basis of all Internet traffic, and fiber signals can travel longer distances. For Silver Valley customers this means more people doing more things faster on a more reliable network.Story continuesNeither rain, nor sleet, nor gloom of night…With recent severe weather in Northern Idaho, snow accumulations and ongoing freezing temperatures made the upgrade to fiber connections difficult and dangerous. Verizon engineers, unable to access the cell site with four-wheel drive vehicles and chained tires, relied on a side-by-side Off Highway Vehicle (OHD) to traverse the frozen area and gain access. Having access to these vehicles in Verizon’s fleet of vehicles is one of many ways Verizon prepares for extreme weather. Verizon’s network is built and fortified in anticipation of hurricanes, wildfires, ice storms, earthquakes and tornadoes, and Verizon’s engineers are prepared to keep people connected in all conditions.“Our engineers are committed to maintaining and enhancing the Verizon network for our customers in any kind of weather,” said French. “We know our customers rely on our network and we will be there for them in the snow, the rain, and the storms.”Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) was formed on June 30, 2000 and is one of the world’s leading providers of technology and communications services. Headquartered in New York City and with a presence around the world, Verizon generated revenues of $133.6 billion in 2021. The company offers data, video and voice services and solutions on its award-winning networks and platforms, delivering on customers’ demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control.VERIZON’S ONLINE MEDIA CENTER: News releases, stories, media contacts and other resources are available at verizon.com/news.

HOLX is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Feb 1, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of 82 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 32.3%. Its earnings surpassed the consensus estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 46.08%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the announcement.Factors at PlayDiagnosticsIn the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Hologic is expected to have witnessed strong growth in the Diagnostics business (excluding COVID) from the growing adoption of Panther instruments and an expanded Panther installed base. During the fourth-quarter earnings update, Hologic noted that the company has nearly 3,250 Panthers instruments placed globally. Its performance might have been driven by both legacy and new assays, namely the BBCVTV vaginitis panel, MGen, CTMG and its respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion.However, with COVID testing significantly down over the past few months, Hologic’s Molecular Diagnostics business is likely to have been impacted by lower COVID-related sales.Our model shows a 48.8% year-over-year decline in total Diagnostics revenues in the first quarter of 2023.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total Diagnostics’ first-quarter revenues is pegged at $482 million, suggesting a decline of 49.3% from year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Breast HealthIn recent months, the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage has aggravated due to persistent supply chain issues and the current geopolitical environment. This is likely to have impacted Hologic’s Breast Health business as it did in the prior-reported fiscal fourth quarter.In November 2022, Hologic announced that the 3Dimensions mammography system was awarded EUREF Type Test certification by the European Reference Organisation for Quality Assured Breast Screening and Diagnostic Services. It is the first digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) system to receive such a distinction and one of only nine mammography systems overall to earn certification. The development is likely to have benefited Hologic’s Breast Health business in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesHologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHologic, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Hologic, Inc. Quote Our model shows a 12.7% year-over-year decline in Breast Health revenues in the first quarter 2023.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s first-quarter revenues is pegged at $316 million, suggesting a decline of 11.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.GYN SurgicalHologic’s GYN Surgical business arm is likely to have gained from an ongoing rebound in elective procedures with the full-fledged opening up of the economy as well as acceleration from new business lines. The business is expected to have benefited from its acquisitions of MyoSure Fluent as well as Bolder and Acessa. Further, similar to the fiscal fourth quarter, we anticipate strong contributions from Bolder's CoolSeal devices to have added to the top-line performance. Hologic’s robust surgical product offerings, including the NovaSure, MyoSure, Acessa laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation system and the Fluent fluid management system, are likely to have resulted in further gains for the business arm in Q1.Our model shows a 1.1% year-over-year decline in GYN Surgical revenues in the first quarter Of 2023.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s first-quarter revenues is pegged at $141 million, suggesting an increase of 5.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Estimate PictureThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total fiscal first-quarter revenues of $980.9 million suggests a decline of 33.3% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 88 cents, indicating a decline of 59.5% from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Hologic this time around.

TRV.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:5 Insurance Stocks to Buy Ahead of Q4 Earnings ResultsWall Street kicked off the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings season last Friday. However, the season will gather pace this week. This reporting cycle will be important as market participants will closely monitor any sign of earnings, revenues or margin decline.A large section of economists and financial experts are concerned that the U.S. economy may face at least a mild recession in 2023 with a higher interest rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed.Nevertheless, five insurers are likely to beat Q4 2022 earnings results. These are - Aflac Inc., Reinsurance Group of America Inc., Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Inc., Unum Group and The Travelers Companies Inc.Insurance Sector Q4 2022An improving interest rate environment benefits life insurers as their products and investments are rate sensitive. A favorable interest rate thus impacts life insurers' earnings, capital and reserves, liquidity, and competitiveness positively.Insurance brokerage firms are continuously expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products. The rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance.Story continuesTo maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. Insurers are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate.Accelerated digitization is also curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. It will also help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and retention rate. While investments in technology increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, insurers must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Our Top PicksFive insurance companies are set to beat on fourth quarter earnings results.

The bank estimated WWE would be worth roughly $8 billion in a sale. At its current share price, WWE has a market cap closer to $6.7 billion.""While no potential strategics have commented, we think there will be reasonable interest from the likes of NFLX, AMZN, and CMCSA since WWE provides lots of hours of content and has a dedicated audience,"" Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall said.""Ultimately, we think NFLX would rather pick-up a night of WWE rights vs the whole company.

But after this Chinese New Year, things will change.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureIn February, two Marvel movies will make their way onto Chinese cinema screens. From Feb. 7, audiences will be able to watch Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, which is releasing in China three months after its worldwide release. Ten days after that, on Feb. 17, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, will release in China—the same day as in the US.Peeking behind China’s de facto ban on Marvel moviesChinese regulators haven’t openly discussed the reasons for rejecting Marvel movies in the last couple of years. A few motivating factors might be:🇨🇳 Prioritizing local content. Scarlett Johansson-starrer Black Widow’s July release coincided with a blackout period in China, where only local productions debut and foreign films are shut out. A late release wouldn’t have boded well for box office collections given sophisticated pirated copies and torrents flooding the market.🤬 Censorship over anti-establishment views. Eternals likely didn’t get a release because director Chloé Zhao has been a vocal critic of her home country in interviews. (China had even censored Zhao’s Oscar win.) Similarly, the chances of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, featuring Marvel’s first Asian superhero, getting a release got slimmer as old videos of star Simu Liu speaking of poverty and starvation in the country surfaced. Even Liu sharing his favorite drink drew flak because it was made by a Hong Kong brand that had been deemed “anti-China.” Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness may have been banned for a shot where a newspaper kiosk showed the Chinese characters for The Epoch Times, an international newspaper that opposes the Chinese Communist Party.Story continues🏳️‍🌈 Censorship of LGBTQ+ censorship. Another reason Eternals was not given a release date could’ve been a same-sex kiss in the movie. Similarly, Chinese authorities may have denied the latest Doctor Strange movie a release because the character America Chavez (played by Xochitl Gomez) is a lesbian. Thor: Love and Thunder was likely also banned in China due to multiple LGBTQ+ references.🇺🇲 Censorship of symbols of US patriotism amid the US-China trade war. China reportedly asked Sony to scrub the Statue of Liberty—a key feature of the climax sequence—from Spiderman: No Way Home. Sony refused, and the film didn’t make it to Chinese theaters.💬 Racism. Tom Hardy, the star of the 2021 film Venom: Let There Be Carnage, which was also denied a China release, used the term “Chinaman” in multiple interviews where he praised actors Marlon Brando and Mickey Rooney for roles they played in yellowface.Despite the heightened scrutiny, Marvel movies have one big reason to continue screening in the mainland: big money.Marvel movies in China, by the digits10%-20%: Share of Marvel movies’ box office revenue collected in China since 2012 (before the rules were changed), second only to the US and Canada$105 million: China box office earnings for 2018’s Black Panther$121 million: China box office earnings for the second Ant-Man movie called Ant-Man and the Wasp$170-$340 million: How much additional revenue Spider-Man: No Way Home potentially lost out on by not releasing in ChinaPerson of interest: Bob Iger“Took Iger 40 business days to end the Marvel blockade in China,” entrepreneur and author Matthew Bell tweeted on the news of China lifting the unofficial ban on Marvel movies.While neither China nor Marvel Studios has disclosed the reason for the change in heart, Bob Iger–the long-term CEO who’s been brought back for two years to do damage control—has historically had good relations with China. He was responsible for getting Chinese authorities to green-light the Shanghai Disneyland project. After he first departed Disney, he was even being touted as a candidate for US ambassador to China.Related stories🗣 Disney issued a blistering statement on activist investor Nelson Peltz’s bid to join its board🙅🏿‍♂ The story behind the racist responses to “Black Panther” in China🐜 Ant-man superpower or just an ant?More from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

The push came just as Disney named Nike chief executive Mike Parker—an aide of long-time CEO Bob Iger who was brought back for a two-year term in November—as the new chairperson.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureBut Disney is vehemently opposed to his election. “Nelson Peltz does not understand Disney’s business and lacks the skills and experience to assist the board,” it said in all caps in an investor presentation filed with the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) yesterday (Nov. 17).Disney and Peltz, by the digits16: “Meaningful interactions” Disney has had with Trian since July 202220: Number of time Peltz or Isaac Perlmutter, an employee and shareholder of Disney who currently serves as chairman of Marvel entertainment, have asked for Peltz to be added to the board since July 20229.4 million: Shares Peltz owns in Disney, which, he argues, helps his case as he’d “bring an ownership mentality to the boardroom and will seek to increase transparency and accountability.”Nelson Peltz’s plans for Disneydatawrapper-chart-jkE5cDisney backs Bob Iger, pokes hole in Peltz’s pointsOn acquisitionsDisney is showing signs of poor corporate governance, strategy and operations, and capital allocations—”including overpaying for the 21st Century Fox assets and bidding aggressively for Sky”—according to Trian Group, which Peltz co-founded.Disney argues the Fox buy was “critical” to position itself better against competing services, and it brought a “deep bench” of talent to the company. Among them is Dana Walden, former chairperson and CEO of Fox Television Group, who’s currently chairperson of Disney General Entertainment Content (DGE) and has been touted as a contender to succeed Iger.Story continuesSeparately, the media behemoth points out that it didn’t buy Sky—it sold its stake at a premium value of $15 billion.On shareholder returnsPeltz’s firm said Disney’s total shareholder return (TSR) “has materially underperformed the S&amp;P 500 over 1-year, 3-year, 5-year and 10-year periods by 24%, 60%, 66%, and 116%, respectively.” As the stock nears 8-year-lows, Disney argues Iger’s the best man for the job, pointing to his last tenure as proof.

The plans also ensure that the electric grid remains reliable and resilient for the 9 million people ComEd serves in northern Illinois as severe weather events become more common due to climate change.""ComEd has a critical role in ensuring the transition to cleaner energy is reliable and equitable for all,"" said ComEd CEO Gil Quiniones. ""These proposed investments are necessary to deliver the resilient 24/7 power our customers depend on, prepare the grid for fleets of electric vehicles and electrification, integrate more clean energy and battery storage, and equitably advance a decarbonized energy future. In addition to supporting the goals of CEJA, the plans will create good-paying local jobs and drive investment to help ensure all communities – especially those that are under-resourced – benefit from the clean energy transition.""The grid plan reflects input provided in 15 ICC-led workshops, which involved hundreds of participants and dozens of presentations on energy issues and community and stakeholder priorities. Following an 11-month open process in which the ICC, other public agencies, and consumer, environmental and other groups will review the plan and costs, the ICC will issue a decision in December 2023. State regulators must find all costs prudent and reasonable before including them in rates.Multi-Year Plan AdvantagesComEd’s rate plan sets base rates and revenue requirements for four years, which provides greater predictability for customers while funding investments that are required to deliver at least 40 percent of benefits to equity investment-eligible communities. The plans align with ComEd 2030, the company’s recently announced vision for a carbon-free energy future that will benefit all communities and meet customers’ changing needs for the rest of this decade and beyond.Story continuesEach investment that ComEd plans helps ensure the safety, resiliency and security of the grid while meeting the demands of climate change, decarbonization and electrification, evolving customer needs, and increasing cyber and physical security threats – all with a focus on equity and affordability. Key areas of investment include:Improving service reliability and storm response: Upgrade and replace poor-performing or obsolete cable, wood poles and other equipment; trim or remove trees near power lines; and deploy advanced analytics that help prevent power outages and improve restoration of service to customers.Supporting the clean energy transition: Enable safe and effective electrification of vehicles, homes and industry through necessary upgrades to power lines and substations to meet increased electric demand and invest in technology needed to integrate large of amounts of clean energy securely, safely and efficiently.Improving coordination with communities: Enhance community resilience to storms and resource management for storm restoration.Ensuring all communities can access and benefit from clean energy: Expand programs to prepare local residents for good-paying clean energy jobs and use the advanced communication network to close the digital divide in under-resourced communities.Bills Among Lowest in Nation; Record-Breaking ReliabilityComEd’s average total monthly customer bill of $93 is among the lowest in the nation today, and its residential customers’ bills are approximately 20 percent lower than the average in the 10 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. ComEd’s plans would result in an increase of about $4.25 in the average monthly residential bill annually from 2024 through 2027, for a total impact of $17 by 2027. At ComEd’s requested rate for 2027, the average residential bill would be less than even the average 2021 residential utility bill in more than half of U.S. states. The plans include an increase in annual delivery costs of $1.47 billion spread out over four years. The company is seeking ICC approval to defer 35 percent of the 2024 increase until 2026 to smooth the transition for ComEd customers.Maintaining a highly reliable grid with fewer and shorter power outages will continue to create savings for customers. ComEd’s reliability is among the best of all large U.S. electric companies and was better in 2022 than in any prior year on record. Since ComEd started smart grid improvements in 2012, it has improved overall reliability by more than 80 percent, helping customers avoid more than 19 million outages and save more than $3.3 billion in outage-related costs. As extreme weather events, electrification and other ComEd customer needs increase, the need to invest in the reliability of the system grows.""We are encouraged that ComEd's plans will build greater resilience, improve the capacity to transition to clean energy and adapt to climate change impacts. We are pleased to support ComEd's multi-year grid plan,"" Neil C.

In 2022, ComEd received a record-setting 19,292 applications from residential, commercial and industrial customers to connect solar panels and other distributed energy resources to ComEd’s grid, a 74 percent increase from the prior year. Sustaining this growth and preparing to serve more electric vehicles, buildings and industries while maintaining grid safety and reliability for ComEd customers will require physical and digital infrastructure upgrades.""EV adoption has grown significantly throughout the country, and specifically in Illinois, in recent years, and we expect this trend to accelerate in the near term,"" said Matthew Deal, manager of utility policy at ChargePoint, the largest online network of independently owned EV charging stations. ""ComEd’s proposed Grid Plan establishes a strong foundation to support the State’s goal for one million EVs on Illinois roads by 2030.""Multi-Year Plans Support Jobs, Drive Economic DevelopmentComEd’s plan will support job creation as renewable energy rapidly expands and various sectors decarbonize. National economic and workforce applied research firm BW Research recently released a first-of-its-kind study that found that the state’s larger transition to clean energy could create a net increase of more than 41,000 jobs by 2030 and 150,000 jobs by 2050 in Illinois.""Illinois leads the nation in moving to a clean energy economy built by union labor,"" said Joe Duffy, executive director of labor coalition Climate Jobs Illinois. ""ComEd's Grid Plan represents an important first step towards the clean jobs future.""In addition, the grid plan advances ComEd’s leading role in supporting economic growth across northern Illinois. Companies continue to invest in the region thanks to the unparalleled access to clean, cost-effective and highly reliable power. As one key example, in the last two years, ComEd has brought 28 commercial projects online, including 12 data centers, representing 6,800 jobs and more than $3 billion in local investment.""As businesses continue to increase their electrification needs, an affordable, reliable, and clean grid has never been more critical,"" said Jack Lavin, President and CEO of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce. ""ComEd’s continued investments in a more sustainable system will keep Illinois competitive by providing a modernized grid that can attract businesses to our state and contribute to their performance.""Performance Metrics Drive Accountability in Achieving Targets and EquityComEd’s plan is subject to ICC-approved performance metrics that set targets for grid performance and equity. They measure: continued improvement in reliability of the overall grid and greater resilience in environmental justice communities; reduction of peak electric demand on the grid; reduction of residential customer disconnections; reduction of the time it takes to connect distributed energy resources; and enhancement of service through the resolution of customer issues.Metrics include ComEd’s spend with diverse suppliers and its impact on the economy. In 2021, ComEd spent $893 million – 42 percent of its total spend – with minority-owned, women-owned, and veteran-owned companies, up from $253 million in 2012. ComEd works with more than 660 diversity-certified suppliers, including The Will Group, a contract manufacturing company.""Over the past 10 years, we have partnered with ComEd on various projects that have transformed communities like the K-Town Business Center in North Lawndale,"" said Joshua Davis, president of The Will Group. ""ComEd's proposed grid plan is a community investment that aligns with our partnership's foundational shared quality of being transformative in the communities in which we operate, and we fully support it.""To continue to support customers who are working to make ends meet, ComEd recently added three new customer-assistance programs to its existing offerings to help income-eligible families and individuals access assistance options and manage their electric bills.ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 200 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

It is worth between $75 and $250 million.

As stated recently by CNBC, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey on Jan 13 showed that the one-year inflation outlook was down to 4%, which reflects the lowest level since April 2021.This might excite an investor to bet on stocks that are already showing signs of growth. However, a prudent investor knows that only a growth exhibiting character is not sufficient while choosing a stock. If one wants to avoid huge losses in times of crisis, one needs to look for relatively safe bets. To this end, we recommend stocks like Oxford Industries,Ingredion, Novo Nordisk, Helmerich &amp; Payne and Fox Factory Holdings, which bear low leverage and therefore can shield investors from incurring losses in times of crisis.Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let's explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to exorbitant debt financing.Therefore, the crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.Story continuesSuch an event shows how volatile the equity market can be at times and as an investor if you don't want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks, which bear low leverage and are hence less risky.To identify such stocks, historically several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders' EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.With the fourth-quarter earnings cycle knocking at the doors, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks that made it through the screen.Oxford Industries: It is an apparel company, which designs, sources, markets and distributes products bearing the trademarks of its owned and licensed brands.

300,64988bb2-24e9-3c6c-8ac4-d2bae867410f,FFIV,2023-01-18,Earnings Preview: F5 Networks (FFIV) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-f5-networks-ffiv-150003243.html,1673967603,STORY,['FFIV'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when F5 Networks (FFIV) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis computer networking company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.33 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -19.4%.Revenues are expected to be $699.7 million, up 1.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for F5?For F5, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.82%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that F5 will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that F5 would post earnings of $2.54 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.62, delivering a surprise of +3.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.F5 doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company's medium-term growth should speed up, driven by pent-up demand for network investments, the analyst told investors in a research note. He noted that Ciena Corporation (NYSE:CIEN)’s three-year targets put it above the peer group of networking companies in terms of growth.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 29 hedge funds were long Ciena Corporation (NYSE:CIEN), compared to 23 funds in the preceding quarter.

New holdings initiated in Q3 included Ciena Corporation (NYSE:CIEN) and Regal Rexnord Corporation. Ciena is a leading optical networking equipment company. It is currently challenged by supply chain issues, but looking forward, we believe Ciena is well positioned to benefit from several trends driving demand for optical networking components and stands to win share from competitors like Huawei.”9.

The analyst raised Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) to a top idea in 2023 as he sees the stock positioned to recover following very challenging 2022 share performance. He sees an unfolding margin, and free cash flow recovery, providing near-to mid term catalysts for the stock. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) was part of 31 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 33 in the last quarter. John W. Rogers’ Ariel Investments is the leading position holder in the company, with 477,118 shares worth $125 million. Ariel Investment made the following comment about Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also bought shares of two companies held in other Ariel portfolios, leading global manufacturer of power generation equipment Generac Holdings, Inc. (GNRC) and bar-code manufacturer Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA).Meanwhile, ZBRA’s brand strength, distribution network and commitment to innovation enable it to take share, earn industry-leading profitability and penetrate new markets. A recent pullback in stock price provided an attractive entry point. Shares have come under pressure due to investor concerns around inflation and supply chain disruptions. At current valuation levels, we think investors are underappreciating ZBRA’s alignment with the global effort to improve supply chain efficiency. At the same time, the company is leveraging the wide moat in its core business to expand into faster growing markets including warehouse robotics and machine vision. Meanwhile ZBRA continues to deliver prodigious free cash flow which we believe will continue to be deployed towards both growth and share repurchases.”8. Juniper Networks, Inc.

This decision further reinforced our confidence in management’s capital allocation discipline knowing that these were highly sought-after assets.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest In.  Suggested articles:13 Cash Rich Penny Stocks That Hedge Funds Are Buying12 Best Oil Stocks To Buy Now11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy Disclosure: None. 13 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest In is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.American International Group (AIG) is a stock many investors are watching right now. AIG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value.AIG is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.05. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. AIG's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.63. AIG's PEG has been as high as 1.47 and as low as 0.84, with a median of 1.04, all within the past year.We should also highlight that AIG has a P/B ratio of 1.18. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 3.08. Over the past 12 months, AIG's P/B has been as high as 1.18 and as low as 0.66, with a median of 0.87.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. AIG has a P/S ratio of 0.81. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.85.Story continuesAnother great Insurance - Multi line stock you could consider is Prudential Financial (PRU), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Shares of Prudential Financial currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 8.27, and its PEG ratio is 0.99. In comparison, its industry sports average P/E and PEG ratios of 9.86 and 1.63.Over the last 12 months, PRU's P/E has been as high as 10.48, as low as 7.31, with a median of 8.69, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.13, as low as 0.81, with a median of 0.96.Prudential Financial also has a P/B ratio of 2.19 compared to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 3.08. Over the past year, its P/B ratio has been as high as 2.39, as low as 0.62, with a median of 1.20.These are only a few of the key metrics included in American International Group and Prudential Financial strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now.

The rotary rig count, issued by BKR, is usually published in major newspapers and trade publications.Baker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry. The number of active rigs and its comparison with the prior-week figure indicates the demand trajectory for Baker Hughes’ oilfield services from exploration and production companies.DetailsTotal U.S. Rig Count Rises: The count of rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States was 775 in the week ended Jan 13. The figure is higher than the prior week’s count. The tally increased in five of the prior 10 weeks. The current national rig count is also higher than the year-ago level of 601.The onshore rigs in the week ended Jan 13 totaled 754, in line with the prior week's count. In offshore resources, 19 rigs were operating, higher than the prior week’s count of 16.U.S. Oil Rig Count Increases: The oil rig count was 623 in the week ended Jan 13, higher than the prior-week figure of 618. The current number of oil rigs — far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014 — is up from the year-ago figure of 492.U.S. Natural Gas Rig Count Decreases: Natural gas rig count of 150 is lower than the prior-week figure of 152. The count of rigs exploring the commodity is, however, higher than the prior-year week’s tally of 109. Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 90.7% lower than the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 26 units, flat with the prior-week count. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology with the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) of 749 is higher than the prior-week level of 746.Story continuesGulf of Mexico (GoM) Rig Count Rises: GoM rig count was 19 units, all oil-directed. The count was higher than the prior-week number of 16.Rig Count in the Most Prolific BasinPermian — the most prolific basin in the United States — recorded a weekly oil rig tally of 353, higher than the prior week's count of 350. The tally increased in four of the previous five weeks.OutlookThe West Texas Intermediate crude price is trading at more than the $75-per-barrel mark, which is highly favorable for exploration and production activities. Solid oil prices will likely pave the way for further rig additions despite a slowdown in drilling activities, as upstream players mainly focus on stockholder returns rather than boosting output.Investors may keep a close eye on energy stocks like EOG Resources EOG and Devon Energy Corporation DVN, as these companies are expected to benefit from the current healthy oil price scenario.EOG Resources, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company. It is well-placed to capitalize on the promising business scenario. It has an estimated 11,500 net undrilled premium locations, resulting in a brightened production outlook.

Vulcan's ability to secure and permit aggregates reserves in strategically located areas, successful acquisitions and strong public construction demand facilitate growth.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growth is challenged by various macroeconomic headwinds like inflationary pressure and supply-chain disruptions. Also, changes in international trade policies, adverse weather conditions, COVID-related risks (material lease concessions) and increased inflation are headwinds.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFocus on GrowthThe company is benefiting from increased public construction demand. Vulcan has been witnessing strong pricing, underpinned by growing public demand (mainly transport) and operational discipline. Public sector construction includes spending by federal, state and local governments for the construction of highways, bridges, airports, dams, roads and other infrastructure construction.The company witnesses strong tax revenues and increased funding from infrastructure investment owing to higher demand from the highway and other infrastructure market. As of the third quarter of 2022, highway start-ups increased 14% and other infrastructure starts increased 18% on a trailing 12-month basis. The company expects that the current strength in private non-residential construction activity and increased public funding will offset residential market slowdown in 2023.The company remains focused on creating long-term value by compounding unit margins through four strategic initiatives — Commercial Excellence, Operational Excellence, Strategic Sourcing and Logistics Innovation, enhancing price growth and operating efficiencies.  In the first nine months of 2022, adjusted EBITDA rose 18.5% on a trailing 12-month period basis, despite the higher energy-related cost.Meanwhile, the acquisitions have helped the company drive its growth. The shipments increased 10% in all product lines during the first nine months of 2022, owing to acquisitions and higher demand. In the first nine months of 2022, the company acquired five aggregates facilities in Texas, four ready-mixed concrete facilities and two idle ready-mixed concrete sites in Virginia; eight aggregates, four asphalt mix and seven ready-mixed concrete operations in California, and an aggregates operation serving limited markets along the Gulf Coast in Honduras for $593.4 million. The return on invested capital as of Sep 30, 2022 was 13.6% on a trailing12-month basis.For 2022, Vulcan planned capital expenditure between $600 and $650 million, including growth and capacity-adding projects. The company invested $465 million in 2021.Story continuesPossible HeadwindsSince 2021, the company has been facing supply chain headwinds and inflationary pressure, particularly in energy and labor. Labor constraints have caused delays and inefficiencies in operations as well as those of customers.Vulcan operations remain susceptible to bad weather conditions, including hurricanes, tornadoes and other weather events, as most of its products are used outdoors in the public or private construction industry. Also, the company’s production and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects the company’s ability to produce and distribute products and as well as demand as construction work can be hampered by weather.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Construction sector are United Rentals, Inc.

(NYSE:MTD) On Your Watch List?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-1-558-time-put-134155977.html,1673962915,STORY,['MTD'],"[Let's talk about the popular Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (NYSE:MTD). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Mettler-Toledo International’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Mettler-Toledo International What Is Mettler-Toledo International Worth?Mettler-Toledo International appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 41.47x is currently well-above the industry average of 30.64x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Mettler-Toledo International’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Mettler-Toledo International?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Mettler-Toledo International's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in MTD’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe MTD should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on MTD for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for MTD, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

That definitely gave me some more confidence.""I think today I had that belief, and I showed that, and I took it to him.""I didn't fear it this time as last time at the French. I don't think I was quite ready to do anything against him (there).""Tiafoe, who beat Chinese qualifier Shang Juncheng to join McDonald in the third round, gave his compatriot a pep talk before Nadal.""I told Mackey: 'Listen, you could join the three amigos, you know: me, Fritz, and Tommy. We all got him. I don't know if you want to join it',"" Tiafoe told reporters.Story continues""Also, I told him, 'You're going to be in a position to win today. You can win today.'""Seeing how he feels, I'm happy for Mackey. GOAT wins don't come easy.""Something to tell his grandkids one day, and you have to be happy for that guy.""

Major stock indexes have recorded two consecutive weeks of gains.A lower wage rate and a contraction in the services sector PMI raised hopes that inflation is cooling in the desired direction. At the same time, market participants remained optimistic that a resilient labor market would enable the Fed with a soft landing of the economy.At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in high dividend paying U.S. corporate behemoths with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies have a strong business model, a solid financial position and globally recognized brand value. A favorable Zacks Rank indicates near-term upside potential of the stocks and high dividend yields should provide a regular income stream.Immediate CatalystsThe Department of Labor reported that the nonfarm payroll increased 223,000 in December beating the consensus estimate of 208,000. However, December’s job additions fell below November’s data that were revised downward to 256,000 from 263,000 reported earlier.Hourly wage rate increased 0.3% in December below the consensus estimate of 0.4%. November’s data was revised downward to 0.4% from 0.6% reported earlier. Year over year,  the hourly wage rate increased 4.6% in December compared with the consensus estimate of 5%. The wage rate increased 4.8% year over year in November.Peak inflation seems behind us. Less-than-expected inflation rates in October and November with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this.The Institute of Supply Management reported that the services sector index for December plummeted to 49.6% in December from 56.5% in November. The consensus estimate was 55.1%. Any reading below 50% indicates a contraction in services activities. The index contracted for the first time since May 2020, at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.A devastated housing market owing to the high mortgage rate, disappointing retail sales in December, the peak festive season, huge inventory accumulation by several retailers, a stiff fall in U.S. manufacturing activities and a good chunk of manpower retrenchment by several U.S. corporate giants indicated that the U.S. economy is cooling in the desired direction of the Fed.Story continuesConsumer Sentiment Data Indicates Inflation Will EaseThe University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 13 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a preliminary reading of 4.0% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021. At the five-year horizon, the outlook rose to 3.0% from 2.9% last month, staying within the range of 2.9%-3.1% for 17 of the last 18 months.Per the report, consumers believe that price pressures will ease considerably over the next 12 months, with the one-year inflation outlook falling in January to the lowest level since the spring of 2021.

See the Notes and Definitions in our supplemental information for further explanation and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.The earnings guidance described above includes potential gains recognized from real estate transactions but excludes any future or potential foreign currency or derivative gains or losses as our guidance assumes constant foreign currency rates.

As a global hub of luxury hospitality and cutting-edge architecture, the ""City of Gold"" offers world-class retail and culture catering to the wants and needs of travelers from all over.

Since the U.S. eased some travel restrictions in May, and with the addition of new direct flight routes, appetite among travelers for Cuba has been surging on Tripadvisor. Known for old-world architecture and rich history, the island offers fascinating opportunities for cultural exchange. This is followed by Hoi An, Vietnam, at No. 2 and Mauritius at No. 3. Asia is the top trending region in this category, taking half of the top 10 spots. Closer to home, Juneau, Alaska, made its debut as the No. 1 Trending Destination in the United States for 2023. Located at the base of Mount Juneau, this is the perfect place for a journey into the gorgeous Alaskan wilderness.

As many plan trips around opportunities to enjoy cuisine, we have issued the best Food Destinations list, highlighting locales known for their cuisine as well as those known for their burgeoning dining scenes. Unsurprisingly, Rome is the No. 1 Food Destination for 2023, while New Orleans tops the U.S. list.

With its stunning landscape and down-to-earth mountain culture, Whistler, Canada, is the No. 1 Ski Destination in the world this year.

It's no secret that destinations abundant in fresh air and pristine nature rose in popularity throughout the pandemic, and although big cities are back, the appetite for outdoor adventure remains strong. In this inaugural category, Mauritius is the No. 1 Nature Destination. A tropical island paradise 1,200 miles off the coast of southeast Africa, Mauritius is home to waterfalls, wildlife areas, and national parks, making it a nature lover's perfect getaway. All the Best Nature Destinations can be seen here.Another new category this year is the Best Places for Culture, celebrating the top places people visit to engage with local history and cultural activities. While every city has its own unique culture, this list reveals travelers' absolute favorite getaways for a cultural trip, headlined by Fes, Morocco, at No. 1. This walled city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site harkening back to medieval times with the ancient maze-like quarters of the Medina to Fes el-Bali and the four imposing Gates of Fes, with their distinctive Moroccan tile work.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.2%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.14%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 1.39%.Coming into today, shares of the truck maker had gained 3.59% in the past month. In that same time, the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector lost 5.25%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.01%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Paccar as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 24, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Paccar to post earnings of $2.23 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 51.7%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $6.99 billion, up 11.09% from the year-ago period.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Paccar. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.13% higher within the past month. Paccar currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Looking at its valuation, Paccar is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 12.05. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 12.05, so we one might conclude that Paccar is trading at a no noticeable deviation comparatively.We can also see that PCAR currently has a PEG ratio of 1.2. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Automotive - Domestic industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.05 as of yesterday's close.Story continuesThe Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 182, putting it in the bottom 28% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

328,c420d07d-e8e3-3c09-abb1-95c7898593b4,PCAR,2023-01-18,Paccar (PCAR) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paccar-pcar-earnings-expected-grow-150003416.html,1673967603,STORY,['PCAR'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Paccar (PCAR) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis truck maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +51.7%.Revenues are expected to be $6.99 billion, up 11.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.21% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Paccar?For Paccar, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.38%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Paccar will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Paccar would post earnings of $2.01 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.21, delivering a surprise of +9.95%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Paccar appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings per share and revenues is pegged at $2.23 and $7 billion, respectively.For the current quarter, the consensus estimate for PACCAR’s earnings per share has moved up by a penny in the past seven days. Its bottom-line estimates imply growth of 51.7% from the year-ago reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly revenues suggests a year-over-year increase of 11.1%. Over the trailing four quarters, PACCAR surpassed earnings estimates on all occasions, with the average surprise being 12.6%. This is depicted in the graph below:PACCAR Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePACCAR Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePACCAR Inc. price-eps-surprise | PACCAR Inc. QuoteQ3 HighlightsPACCAR topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues in third-quarter 2022. Its adjusted earnings per share of $2.21 surpassed the consensus metric of $2.01 and rocketed 109% year over year. Higher-than-expected pretax income from the Trucks, Parts and Financial segments resulted in the outperformance.Consolidated revenues (including trucks and financial services) came in at $7,059 billion, up from $5,146.8 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2021. Sales from Trucks, Parts and Others were $6,687 million, which marginally missed the consensus mark of $6,692 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for the trucking giant in the quarter to be reported, as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: PACCAR has an Earnings ESP of +1.63%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged 3 cents higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Story continuesZacks Rank: It currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors at PlayRobust demand from its Class 8 heavy-duty trucks is likely to have aided PACCAR’s trucking revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Leading brands, namely Kenworth, DAF and Peterbilt, are likely to have driven the deliveries.The new DAF lineup has improved the company’s product mix. The consensus mark for total truck deliveries is 47,805 units, increasing from 47,600 units reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for revenues from the Truck segment is $5,515 million, indicating a rise from $4,962 million recorded in the previous-year quarter. The pretax profit estimate for the segment is $488 million, significantly up from $193 million reported in the year-ago period.The demand for aftermarket parts is on the rise, spurred by high truck utilization and increased average fleet age. Encouragingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues from the Parts segment is pegged at $1,439 million, indicating a rise from $1,312 million recorded in the previous-year quarter. The estimate for pretax profit of the segment, pegged at $372 million, also suggests an increase from $306 million.Meanwhile, the consensus mark for revenues from the Financial Services segment is $374 million, implying a slight decline from $390 million recorded in the previous-year quarter.Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationLet’s take a look at a couple of other players from the auto space, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat for the quarter to be reported:Lear LEA will release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 2.

330,ef8017ca-9c34-3055-b551-f854103c6368,TROW,2023-01-18,Is T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Balanced (TRPBX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-personal-strategy-120012572.html,1673956812,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'TROW']","[If investors are looking at the Mutual Fund Equity Report fund category, make sure to pass over T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Balanced (TRPBX). TRPBX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 4 (Sell), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerTRPBX finds itself in the T. Rowe Price family, based out of Baltimore, MD. Since T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Balanced made its debut in June of 1994, TRPBX has garnered more than $1.30 billion in assets. Charles Shriver is the fund's current manager and has held that role since May of 2011.PerformanceOf course, investors look for strong performance in funds. TRPBX has a 5-year annualized total return of 3.65% and is in the middle third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 1.63%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, TRPBX's standard deviation comes in at 14.12%, compared to the category average of 15.69%. The fund's standard deviation over the past 5 years is 12.09% compared to the category average of 13.67%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsWith a 5-year beta of 0.62, the fund is likely to be less volatile than the market average. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. With a negative alpha of -2.79, managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.ExpensesCosts are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, TRPBX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.51% compared to the category average of 0.86%. So, TRPBX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.Story continuesInvestors need to be aware that with this product, the minimum initial investment is $2,500; each subsequent investment needs to be at least $100.Bottom LineOverall, T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Balanced ( TRPBX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.Your research on the Mutual Fund Equity Report segment doesn't have to stop here.

A steadily growing direct-to-consumer (DTC) business and the China reopening are some of the key positives in the Nike story. These big-picture positives notwithstanding, the Zacks analyst flagged margin pressures due to higher costs and bigger markdowns. The company provided a bleak view for fiscal 2023 and second-quarter driven by expectations of higher markdowns during the holiday season and slowed demand for NIKE's brands, including Jordan and Converse, due to reduced discretionary spending. The Zacks analyst believes that the gross margin headwinds and the weakness in Greater China to continue hurting NIKE results in the quarters ahead.However, NKE’s robust surprise trend continued in fiscal first quarter with earnings and sales surpassing estimates for the ninth and fourth straight quarter, respectively.(You can read the full research report on NIKE here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Novartis have gained +0.6% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +14.6%.

Major stock indexes have recorded two consecutive weeks of gains.A lower wage rate and a contraction in the services sector PMI raised hopes that inflation is cooling in the desired direction. At the same time, market participants remained optimistic that a resilient labor market would enable the Fed with a soft landing of the economy.At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in high dividend paying U.S. corporate behemoths with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies have a strong business model, a solid financial position and globally recognized brand value. A favorable Zacks Rank indicates near-term upside potential of the stocks and high dividend yields should provide a regular income stream.Immediate CatalystsThe Department of Labor reported that the nonfarm payroll increased 223,000 in December beating the consensus estimate of 208,000. However, December’s job additions fell below November’s data that were revised downward to 256,000 from 263,000 reported earlier.Hourly wage rate increased 0.3% in December below the consensus estimate of 0.4%. November’s data was revised downward to 0.4% from 0.6% reported earlier. Year over year,  the hourly wage rate increased 4.6% in December compared with the consensus estimate of 5%. The wage rate increased 4.8% year over year in November.Peak inflation seems behind us. Less-than-expected inflation rates in October and November with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this.The Institute of Supply Management reported that the services sector index for December plummeted to 49.6% in December from 56.5% in November. The consensus estimate was 55.1%. Any reading below 50% indicates a contraction in services activities. The index contracted for the first time since May 2020, at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.A devastated housing market owing to the high mortgage rate, disappointing retail sales in December, the peak festive season, huge inventory accumulation by several retailers, a stiff fall in U.S. manufacturing activities and a good chunk of manpower retrenchment by several U.S. corporate giants indicated that the U.S. economy is cooling in the desired direction of the Fed.Story continuesConsumer Sentiment Data Indicates Inflation Will EaseThe University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 13 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a preliminary reading of 4.0% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021. At the five-year horizon, the outlook rose to 3.0% from 2.9% last month, staying within the range of 2.9%-3.1% for 17 of the last 18 months.Per the report, consumers believe that price pressures will ease considerably over the next 12 months, with the one-year inflation outlook falling in January to the lowest level since the spring of 2021. Consequently, consumers spirits are getting a boost. The University of Michigan's preliminary January reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment came in at 64.6%, up from 59.7% in the prior month.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate bigwigs (market capital &gt; $50 billion) with a current dividend yield of &gt; 2%.

The company registered year-over-year growth in revenues on both reported and organic basis.The top line was driven by strong CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth.

How can that be, you wonder? You have plenty of credit available, and your monthly Netflix charge is the only action this card ever sees.Bingo.Read More: Gen Z and Millennials Favor National and Online Banks, Survey Shows — What Does That Mean for the Future of Credit Unions?See: GOBankingRates’ Best Online BanksGiven the sparse use of the card and the lack of any prior travel purchases, your issuer flagged your account for potential fraud. That leaves you stuck in an embarrassing situation at the desk, along with a problem you must fix before your vacation can proceed.Financial institutions employ a mix of algorithms and artificial intelligence to keep your account safe, and atypical transactions or expenditures could raise suspicion — and be declined — if they don’t fit a pattern of previous purchases. That’s why some banks advise you to notify them if you’re traveling out of your home region or making an unusually large purchase, even in your own ZIP code, to assure the transaction will occur without a hitch.GOBankingRates’ Top Picks: Best Savings AccountsNotifying Your Card CompanyWhen you’ve confirmed your travel dates and destinations, many banks advise that you take the extra step of notifying your credit card company of the details so that you can travel confidently. Wells Fargo, for one, recommends calling to speak with a customer service representative or adding your travel plan via your online account or mobile app. Citizens Bank, U.S. Bank, Citi and PNC Bank are among other banks that accept travel notifications online.However, a growing number of major banks no longer advise letting the bank know of your travel plans because of their own increased security measures, with Bank of America, Chase and Capital One among them.Story continues“With the added security of your Capital One chip card, travel notifications are no longer needed on your credit card,” reads a notice posted to Capital One cardholders. “You don’t have to tell us when and where you’re traveling, inside or outside the United States. Your credit card is 100% covered for fraud while you’re traveling and we will alert you if we see anything suspicious.”Boost Your Finances: 7 Simple Habits That Will Make You Richer in 2022Taking Extra Steps Before TravelOne area where the banks agree is the need to update your mobile account before your departure to keep your account secure while traveling. With 89% of respondents in the Insider Intelligence’s Mobile Banking Competitive Edge Study saying they use mobile banking, the majority of credit card holders can help themselves.Banks, such as Capital One and Bank of America, advise making sure your contact information is up to date. If your cellphone won’t work internationally, it’s vital to have a current email address on file — and be sure to monitor the account. Then, set your account to receive alerts in case the bank needs to notify you about activity on your card. With many card issuers, you can sign up to receive instant notifications of purchases to help you stay on budget — and also to remain confident that no one else has tapped into your account.Through mobile banking, you also may freeze your account should you misplace your card while traveling.Find Out: How To Compound Your Income in 2022Following Other Travel TipsWells Fargo recommends traveling with two credit cards — one you carry with you as your primary mode of spending and a secondary that you keep secured in a separate place in case you lose or experience another problem with your main card. Also, make note of the bank’s international customer service number should you need to get in touch while on the road and store it with your passport, per Wells Fargo. The number likely is on the back of your card.Bank of America also recommends making two copies of your credit cards, as well as your passport and other travel documents. Take a copy with you on your trip and store it in a secure place; leave the second one with a relative or trusted friend. Or, upload photos of them to the cloud to access your data from abroad. So far from home, it’s wise to have access to this vital information in the event of loss, theft or another unforeseen event.If in doubt about your bank’s preferences when it comes to hearing your travel plans, reach out and ask, either in person with your teller, by telephone or via online chat.

344,cf1ab58f-9729-31a9-8b47-6d629b497efc,COF,2023-01-18,Earnings Preview: Capital One (COF) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-capital-one-cof-150003906.html,1673967603,STORY,"['COF', 'COF-PJ', 'ALLY']","[Capital One (COF) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis credit card issuer and bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.90 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -27.9%.Revenues are expected to be $9 billion, up 10.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.52% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Capital One?For Capital One, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.41%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Capital One will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Capital One would post earnings of $5.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.20, delivering a surprise of -16.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Capital One doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry, Ally Financial (ALLY) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.98 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -51.5%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.04 billion, down 7.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Ally Financial has been revised 2.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -9.58%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ally Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The coffee chain tested DoorDash in Atlanta, Houston and Sacramento, California, before adding Seattle; Portland, Oregon; and New York City last year.Starbucks delivery has been available on Uber Eats nationwide since 2020. Starbucks will expand its DoorDash areas in coming weeks and is expected to be in all 50 states by March, the company said.While some cash-strapped consumers have cut back on delivery as inflation and menu prices soared, Starbucks says its customers - who tend to be wealthier and have continued buying fancy customized beverages despite higher prices - want more drinks and snacks brought right to them.The coffee chain's U.S. delivery had grown 20% year over year and people were spending about twice as much money on delivery orders versus in-store orders, Chief Marketing Officer Brady Brewer said at the company's Investor Day in September.""Delivery represents a significant growth opportunity for us that we anticipate to double in revenue in the next couple of years,"" he said, according to a transcript.The Seattle-based chain reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 2.Overall, U.S. fast-food delivery orders surged during the pandemic, but that growth is tapering off.

Also, defense shipments rose 2.1% year over year.Combining both the segments, Boeing’s total deliveries in the fourth quarter were 200 units compared with the 146 units delivered in the year-ago period. Such strong delivery numbers are likely to bolster BA’s top line in the fourth quarter.Commercial Deliveries Remain a Key ContributorBoeing reported commercial deliveries of 152 airplanes in the fourth quarter of 2022,  an increase from the prior-year tally of 99. This was primarily driven by Boeing 737 and 787 airplane deliveries.The shipments of Boeing 737 totaled 110 compared with 84 in the year-ago period, registering growth of 31% year over year. Boeing delivered 22 787 jets in the fourth quarter, while that in the year-ago quarter was nil.The company also shipped 12 767 jets in the quarter, four more than the year-ago quarter’s tally.The shipments of the 777 model totaled six, compared with four in the previous year’s third-quarter tally. The delivery figure of Boeing 747 was two in the quarter, compared with three in the last year’s figures.Boeing vs. AirbusA comparative analysis of Boeing’s archrival Airbus SE’s EADSY commercial shipment indicates that the latter came ahead of Boeing in terms of delivery numbers. Airbus delivered 226 commercial aircraft in the fourth quarter, compared with Boeing’s 152 in the same period.However, the year-over-year growth rate of both the companies has a different story, with Boeing’s deliveries indicating an improvement of an impressive 31%. Meanwhile, EADSY registered growth of 20.9%, indicating that BA is on a better growth trajectory.Defense Deliveries UpBoeing reported defense deliveries of 48 airplanes in the fourth quarter of 2022,  an increase from the prior-year tally of 47.Story continuesThe shipments of AH-64 Apache (remanufactured) deliveries remained steady at 14 compared with the year-ago period’s tally, while the delivery of AH-64 Apache (new) decreased to five compared with eight in the  year-ago period.

Meanwhile, the delivery of the KC-46 Tanker remained unchanged year over year at six, while three F/A-18 jets were delivered compared with six in the fourth quarter of 2022.The delivery of P-8 models decreased to two from five in the fourth-quarter of 2021; two commercial and civil satellites were delivered compared to none in the year-ago quarter.

Major stock indexes have recorded two consecutive weeks of gains.A lower wage rate and a contraction in the services sector PMI raised hopes that inflation is cooling in the desired direction. At the same time, market participants remained optimistic that a resilient labor market would enable the Fed with a soft landing of the economy.At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in high dividend paying U.S. corporate behemoths with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies have a strong business model, a solid financial position and globally recognized brand value. A favorable Zacks Rank indicates near-term upside potential of the stocks and high dividend yields should provide a regular income stream.Immediate CatalystsThe Department of Labor reported that the nonfarm payroll increased 223,000 in December beating the consensus estimate of 208,000. However, December’s job additions fell below November’s data that were revised downward to 256,000 from 263,000 reported earlier.Hourly wage rate increased 0.3% in December below the consensus estimate of 0.4%. November’s data was revised downward to 0.4% from 0.6% reported earlier. Year over year,  the hourly wage rate increased 4.6% in December compared with the consensus estimate of 5%. The wage rate increased 4.8% year over year in November.Peak inflation seems behind us. Less-than-expected inflation rates in October and November with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this.The Institute of Supply Management reported that the services sector index for December plummeted to 49.6% in December from 56.5% in November. The consensus estimate was 55.1%. Any reading below 50% indicates a contraction in services activities. The index contracted for the first time since May 2020, at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.A devastated housing market owing to the high mortgage rate, disappointing retail sales in December, the peak festive season, huge inventory accumulation by several retailers, a stiff fall in U.S. manufacturing activities and a good chunk of manpower retrenchment by several U.S. corporate giants indicated that the U.S. economy is cooling in the desired direction of the Fed.Story continuesConsumer Sentiment Data Indicates Inflation Will EaseThe University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 13 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a preliminary reading of 4.0% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021. At the five-year horizon, the outlook rose to 3.0% from 2.9% last month, staying within the range of 2.9%-3.1% for 17 of the last 18 months.Per the report, consumers believe that price pressures will ease considerably over the next 12 months, with the one-year inflation outlook falling in January to the lowest level since the spring of 2021. Consequently, consumers spirits are getting a boost. The University of Michigan's preliminary January reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment came in at 64.6%, up from 59.7% in the prior month.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate bigwigs (market capital &gt; $50 billion) with a current dividend yield of &gt; 2%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, The Coca-Cola Co. KO, Roche Holding AG RHHBY, Lam Research Corp. LRCX and Valero Energy Corp. VLO.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Top Research Reports for UnitedHealth, Coca-Cola and RocheThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including UnitedHealth Group Inc., The Coca-Cola Co. and Roche Holding AG. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of UnitedHealth Group have gained +4.5% over the past year against the Zacks Medical sector's -12% decline and -15.7% decline for the S&amp;P 500 index. The company's top line has been growing and the momentum should continue in the years ahead on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings.The company's solid health services segment provides diversification benefits. UNH's Government business remains well-poised for growth. A sturdy balance sheet enables investments.However, softness in commercial business due to COVID-induced volatilities persists. Rising operating costs are hurting margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth Group here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Coca-Cola held up a lot better than many others in last year's tough market; the stock was effectively flat in 2022, modestly better than rival Pepsi's -0.3% decline, but significantly better than the Zacks Consumer Staple sector's -5.1% decline (the market overall was down -15.7%). The company is scheduled to report 2022 Q4 results on February 14th, but its preceding period results (2022 Q3) benefited from the continued momentum from the first half of 2022. Sales gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales.Coca-Cola benefited from underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels. According to the Zacks analyst, estimated organic revenue growth of 14.8% and comparable earnings per share growth of 6.6%, in line with the company's raised view for 2022. Innovations and accelerating digital investments bode well.However, pressures from higher transportation and input costs remain. Higher marketing spends and currency headwinds are concerning.(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Roche Holding have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-21.6% vs. +14.6%). The company's performance has been hit by significantly lower COVID-related sales in both divisions as the pandemic eased out. Sales of Actemra/RoActemra and Ronapreve (COVID-19) are declining with the pandemic weakening in several countries since last year. The competition is stiff for Tecentriq. The decline in sales of drugs like Herceptin, Avastin and MabThera will continue to drag sales down. Pipeline setbacks are a concern.Nevertheless, strong demand for new drugs, namely Hemlibra (hemophilia), Ocrevus (multiple sclerosis), Evrysdi (spinal muscular atrophy), Phesgo (cancer) and Tecentriq (cancer), maintained momentum. The Diagnostics division also remained stable in terms of the growth of its routine business.(You can read the full research report on Roche Holding here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Lam Research Corp. and Valero Energy Corp.Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

MHK provided an update on its fourth-quarter 2022 outlook for adjusted EPS. Since its last quarter's earnings release on Oct 27, 2022, the company witnessed interest rate hike pressure, along with high inflation and lagging consumer confidence in the United States and Europe markets. This resulted in more softness in the global residential flooring business than MHK expected.Due to this, Mohawk continued with temporary plant shutdowns, which negatively impacted margins and quarterly results. Also, weak demand in Flooring North America forced Mohawk to reduce its inventory levels. Due to these factors, the company expects fourth-quarter adjusted EPS between $1.27 and $1.31, excluding any restructuring or other one-time charges. Earlier, it anticipated adjusted EPS of $1.40-$1.50, excluding any restructuring charges. In fourth-quarter 2021, the metric totaled $2.95 per share. It plans to release its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 9.Apart from this, it signed a contract with plaintiffs to resolve the previously disclosed securities class action lawsuit. Initially filed on Jan 3, 2020, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, this lawsuit could be protracted, burdensome and expensive.Additionally, Mohawk settled a previously disclosed dispute with the Belgian Tax Authority (“BTA”) regarding the tax treatment of royalty income arising from intellectual property. In April 2022, the BTA issued a tax assessment of €187 million (including penalties but excluding interest) for 2013-2018. Although Mohawk believes its tax position in Belgium is correct, it entered an agreement with the BTA on Nov 23, 2022, to settle the dispute for a one-time payment of €3 million.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have declined 28.5% in the past year compared with the Zacks Textile - Home Furnishing industry’s 30.8% fall. For 2023, earnings estimates of $10.28 per share suggest a 21% year-over-year decline.

Jakafi is a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera (“PV”) who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to hydroxyurea. It is also approved for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), including primary MF, post-PV MF and post-essential thrombocythemia MF. The drug is also approved in the United States for treating steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years or older.Jakafi’s sales were $1.8 billion in the first nine months of 2022, up 14% year over year, as demand for the drug has been steadily increasing over the last few quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchJakafi is marketed by Incyte in the United States and by Novartis NVS as Jakavi outside the United States. Incyte also earns product royalty revenues from Novartis for the commercialization of Jakafi in non-U.S. markets.Apart from Jakafi, the approval of additional drugs diversified the company’s portfolio and generated an incremental stream of revenues. The approval of Opzelura, a novel cream formulation of ruxolitinib, for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) in non-immunocompromised patients aged 12 years or older, has strengthened the company’s portfolio. Per the company, over 62,000 units of Opzelura were shipped in the third quarter, with growth fueled by both AD and vitiligo.Incyte Corporation Price and ConsensusIncyte Corporation Price and ConsensusIncyte Corporation price-consensus-chart | Incyte Corporation QuoteLast month, Incyte and CMS Aesthetics, a dermatology medical aesthetic company and subsidiary of CMS, announced that the companies entered into an agreement for the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib cream for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory dermatologic diseases in Greater China and certain countries in Southeast Asia.Story continuesEarlier, approval of drugs like Pemazyre (pemigatinib), a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adults with previously-treated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or other rearrangements, broadened the portfolio. The initial uptake of the drug has been encouraging. The FDA also approved a label expansion of Pemazyre for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms (MLNs) with FGFR1 rearrangement.The adoption of other newly approved drugs like Monjuvi is also a positive and should boost sales in the upcoming quarters.INCY also receives product royalty revenues from Eli Lilly LLY for Olumiant (baricitinib). The drug is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor discovered by Incyte and licensed to Lilly. It is also approved for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Recent label expansions will propel the top line further and generate more royalties for INCY.However, increasing competition for Jakafi is a concern. The company is highly dependent on its lead drug Jakafi for a major chunk of its revenues, and a slowdown will adversely impact sales.Incyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the biotech space is Syndax Pharmaceuticals SNDX, which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Over the past 60 days, loss estimates for Syndax have narrowed to $2.48 from $2.53.

This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Stryker (SYK) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to SYK for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Stryker's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Stryker's main business drivers.Headquartered in Kalamazoo, MI, Stryker Corporation is one of the world’s largest medical device companies operating in the global orthopedic market. The company has three business segments: Orthopaedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology &amp; Spine.Orthopaedic products primarily include implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremities surgeries.MedSurg products consists of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems (Instruments); endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy); patient handling and emergency medical equipment (Medical); and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices (Sustainability) as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties.Neurotechnology &amp; Spine division includes both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices. These includes products used for minimally invasive endovascular techniques; traditional brain and open skull base surgical procedures; orthobiologic and biosurgery products, including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products; and minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.Spinal implant product offering includes cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spinal injury, deformity and degenerative therapies.It is important to note here that effective from Dec 31, 2021, Stryker has updated its reportable business segments to align to its new internal reporting structure.2021 at a GlanceStryker’s full-year revenues totaled $17.11 billion, up 19.2% from the previous year. Adjusted earnings per share of $9.09 increased 22.3% from the previous year.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Stryker ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in January 2013 would be worth $4,371.87, or a 337.19% gain, as of January 17, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 171.56% and gold's return of 9.43% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for SYK too.Stryker saw strong performance across both of its segments in third-quarter 2022. Internationally, the company reported mid-single-digit organic growth, highlighted by double-digit organic growth in Europe and emerging markets. A solid solvency position is a plus. Its second quarter results ended on a weak note, wherein both earnings and revenues miss their estimates. Over the past year, Stryker outperformed the industry. Per management, the company managed to deliver robust growth in both of its businesses and demonstrated promising integration of Wright Medical despite the COVID-19 led disruptions.

369,4cd57b10-d8b9-3e3d-b472-e3961b5d0738,LYB,2023-01-18,The Path to Leadership: A Circular and Low Carbon Solutions Provider,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/path-leadership-circular-low-carbon-151500950.html,1673968500,STORY,['LYB'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / January 17, 2023 / LyondellBasell:LyondellBasell, Tuesday, January 17, 2023, Press release pictureIn the summer of 2019, I took my kids on a trip to Kenya to see the beauty of Africa and the wildlife. Driving in the heart of Africa, we saw little communities burning trash, including plastic bottles. My daughters looked at me and said, ""Mommy, you need to do something about this."" This moment made me question what else I could do personally to solve this issue and working in the plastic industry gives me the perfect opportunity to be a bigger part of the solution. As such, I am thrilled to lead LyondellBasell's new Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business unit which allows my team to help to address one of the world's biggest challenge: plastic waste. Our aim is to create a sustainable business model that will reshape the plastics value chain and create benefits for customers and society. Building this new business unit gives us clear accountability and a differentiated operating model that requires an entrepreneurial mindset. Our team will focus on addressing challenges in plastic feedstock access and developing scalable technologies to enable us to lead in circularity and low carbon solutions.At LyondellBasell, we want to be the change leaders, fostering innovative solutions that will transform the market for plastics. This is why we announced last month our decision to move forward with engineering to build a commercial-scale advanced recycling plant at our Wesseling, Germany, site. Using LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec technology, this advanced recycling plant is being designed to convert processed mixed plastic waste into feedstock for new plastic production. Our MoReTec technology will help address the challenge of mixed plastic waste, which today mostly ends up in landfills or incineration. MoReTec technology can also address challenging segments like food packaging and healthcare products. This high-yield, differential technology will allow us to convert plastic waste into pyrolysis oil and pyrolysis gas for use in our crackers as feedstock leading to the production of new plastic materials.Story continuesOur advanced recycling MoReTec technology is a complementary solution to conventional mechanical recycling, as it enables the conversion of difficult-to-recycle plastic waste into new products. This MoReTec plant is another milestone on our path to becoming the leader in circular and low carbon solutions for our customers.Our Commitment and DirectionOur goal is to produce and market two million metric tons of recycled and renewable-based polymers annually by 2030. We want to ensure we can offer the full scope of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) packaging solutions our customers and brand owners are asking for to help them meet their recycling commitments by 2025 and 2030. Our strategy is grounded upon our vision to become a leader in the growing market for circular and low carbon solutions and the global supplier of choice for customers and brand owners. To accomplish this, we are:Expanding our recycling capacity globally to help address the challenge of plastic waste and support the transition to a circular economyAccelerating the development and implementation of a portfolio of scalable recycling technologiesInvesting along the value chain to become a full-solution provider for customers and brand ownersGrowing our recycled and renewable-based product offering through the Circulen portfolio of productsOffering the plastics and chemicals our customers need to manufacture a wide range of products people use in their everyday lives including food packaging, home furnishings, automotive components, paints and coatings.The Path to LeadershipIn addition to our advanced recycling site plans and our new dedicated Circular and Low Carbon Solutions Business Unit, LyondellBasell is investing in joint ventures (JV) and strategic collaborations in state-of-the-art sorting units. For instance, LyondellBasell is venturing into the upstream side of the business to process the mixed plastic waste and flexible packaging of approximately 1.3 million German citizens yearly. This is all part of a new JV called Source One Plastics, which LyondellBasell formed with German company 23 Oaks Investment. This JV is building a new energy-efficient, advanced plastic waste sorting and recycling facility in Germany and will produce processed waste. The facility will provide a material part of the feedstock for our MoReTec advanced recycling plant being planned in Wesseling.Additionally, we have signed an agreement to advance development of a first-of-its-kind plastic waste sorting and processing facility in the Houston area with Exxon and Cyclyx. The new facility addresses a critical missing link in the plastic waste supply chain by connecting community recycling programs to new and more advanced recycling technologies that have the potential to take a much wider variety of plastic materials.We also launched a first-of-its-kind plastics collection program in Kingwood, Texas, aiming to recycle a greater share of the post-use plastic products we use every day - instead of throwing them away. This new program is a part of the Houston Recycling Collaboration launched earlier this year to increase the amount of waste plastics diverted from landfills and to find new recycling options for them that will significantly increase in the city's plastics recycling rate, leveraging new investments in preprocessing and recycling technologies.LyondellBasell is expanding our mechanical recycling capabilities, to increase supply of our CirculenRecover products globally. We signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to establish a mechanical recycling JV with Genox Recycling in China to recycle post-consumer plastic waste.We also signed an MOU to form a JV with Shakti Plastic Industries to build a plastic sorting and mechanical recycling unit in India focused on processing post-consumer waste.LyondellBasell is collaborating across the value chain to grow our Circulen product offering.We recently entered into a long-term supply agreement with Envision Plastics to purchase mechanically recycled high-density polyethylene post-consumer resin (HDPE PCR) for use in CirculenRecover single pellet solutions in North America.Also, LyondellBasell is collaborating with Audi to help close the loop for mixed automotive plastic waste. We are recycling mixed automotive plastic waste and processing it into new plastics using advanced recycling technology. Audi is using this new plastic in the seatbelt buckle covers in the Q8 e-tron. With this project, LyondellBasell and Audi are recycling a stream of material which today is mostly only suitable for energy recovery. This reduces the usage of fossil-based primary materials for the Audi Q8 e-tron and keeps valuable plastic feedstocks in a circular loop.Final Thoughts and the Path ForwardLyondellBasell is committed to creating more sustainable solutions for our customers and helping to enable a sustainable future for our children. The efforts we have made so far around recycling are just the beginning. We are making bold moves around technologies, investments and collaborations, and covering all major continents. We believe having a future-focused, well-designed, sustainable business model will help to make a circular and low carbon future possible. It is exciting and great opportunities lie ahead of us to advance our sustainability and circularity ambitions. I am truly honored to be a part of it - to help make a difference not only for my daughters to be proud of me but for future generations to come.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThe statements in this article relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.

370,773353a4-5e58-3785-9840-02b84f6d86b8,VMC,2023-01-18,Vulcan (VMC) Rises 23.4% in 6 Months Despite Industry Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vulcan-vmc-rises-23-4-151803494.html,1673968683,STORY,"['VMC', 'CRH', 'URI']","[Vulcan Materials Company’s VMC shares have risen 23.4% in the past six months compared with the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry’s 20.6% rise. Vulcan's ability to secure and permit aggregates reserves in strategically located areas, successful acquisitions and strong public construction demand facilitate growth.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growth is challenged by various macroeconomic headwinds like inflationary pressure and supply-chain disruptions. Also, changes in international trade policies, adverse weather conditions, COVID-related risks (material lease concessions) and increased inflation are headwinds.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFocus on GrowthThe company is benefiting from increased public construction demand. Vulcan has been witnessing strong pricing, underpinned by growing public demand (mainly transport) and operational discipline. Public sector construction includes spending by federal, state and local governments for the construction of highways, bridges, airports, dams, roads and other infrastructure construction.The company witnesses strong tax revenues and increased funding from infrastructure investment owing to higher demand from the highway and other infrastructure market. As of the third quarter of 2022, highway start-ups increased 14% and other infrastructure starts increased 18% on a trailing 12-month basis. The company expects that the current strength in private non-residential construction activity and increased public funding will offset residential market slowdown in 2023.The company remains focused on creating long-term value by compounding unit margins through four strategic initiatives — Commercial Excellence, Operational Excellence, Strategic Sourcing and Logistics Innovation, enhancing price growth and operating efficiencies.  In the first nine months of 2022, adjusted EBITDA rose 18.5% on a trailing 12-month period basis, despite the higher energy-related cost.Meanwhile, the acquisitions have helped the company drive its growth. The shipments increased 10% in all product lines during the first nine months of 2022, owing to acquisitions and higher demand. In the first nine months of 2022, the company acquired five aggregates facilities in Texas, four ready-mixed concrete facilities and two idle ready-mixed concrete sites in Virginia; eight aggregates, four asphalt mix and seven ready-mixed concrete operations in California, and an aggregates operation serving limited markets along the Gulf Coast in Honduras for $593.4 million. The return on invested capital as of Sep 30, 2022 was 13.6% on a trailing12-month basis.For 2022, Vulcan planned capital expenditure between $600 and $650 million, including growth and capacity-adding projects. The company invested $465 million in 2021.Story continuesPossible HeadwindsSince 2021, the company has been facing supply chain headwinds and inflationary pressure, particularly in energy and labor. Labor constraints have caused delays and inefficiencies in operations as well as those of customers.Vulcan operations remain susceptible to bad weather conditions, including hurricanes, tornadoes and other weather events, as most of its products are used outdoors in the public or private construction industry. Also, the company’s production and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects the company’s ability to produce and distribute products and as well as demand as construction work can be hampered by weather.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Construction sector are United Rentals, Inc. URI, CRH plc CRH and Dycom Industries, Inc. DY.United Rentals currently sports a Zacks Rank #2. Shares of the company have gained 52.6% in the past six-month period. The long-term earnings growth of the company is 18.2%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for URI’s 2023 sales and EPS suggests growth of 11.8% and 14.9%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s estimated levels.CRH currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. Shares of CRH have rallied 30.5% in the past six months.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CRH’s 2024 sales and EPS suggests growth of 3.6% and 11%, respectively.Dycom currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. DY has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 142.93%, on average. Shares of the company have gained 29.4% in the past six-month period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DY’s fiscal 2024 sales and EPS suggests growth of 7.3% and 28.1%, respectively.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

371,53427311-f42b-3e2a-82fb-23287c652799,CINF,2023-01-18,CINF or CNA: Which P&C Insurance Stock is Better Positioned?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cinf-cna-p-c-insurance-140402966.html,1673964242,STORY,"['CNA', 'CINF']","[The Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry is likely to benefit from improved pricing, an increase in interest rate, exposure growth, prudent underwriting and a solid capital position. These poise property and casualty insurers well amid a volatile market.    The industry has risen 2.1% in the past year against the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s decline of 14.1% and the Finance sector’s 10.8% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere we focus on two property and casualty insurers, namely Cincinnati Financial Corporation CINF and CNA Financial Corporation CNA.Cincinnati Financial, with a market capitalization of $17.1 billion, provides property casualty insurance products in the United States. CNA Financial, with a market capitalization of $11.7 billion, provides commercial property and casualty insurance products primarily in the United States. Both insurers carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Per Global Insurance Market Index released by Marsh, global commercial insurance prices increased 6% in the third quarter of 2022. It marked the 20th consecutive quarter of price increases. Per the Swiss Re Institute, the insurance industry is expected to generate premium growth of 2.1% on average over the next two years. An expanded distribution, operational strength, higher retention, strong renewal, price increases and a solid balance sheet are likely to help insurers retain momentum.Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase about six-fold to $722 billion by 2030. Per a report from the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, global life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023.The insurance industry is likely to grow on the back of higher new business premiums, growth in the line of business and expanding international business.The P&amp;C insurers remain exposed to catastrophe loss from natural disasters and weather-related events, which induce volatility in their underwriting results. Per Swiss Re Institute, natural catastrophe activity resulted in insured losses of $115 billion in 2022, which is higher than the 10-year average of $81 billion. Swiss Re estimated Hurricane Ian to be the most expensive one, with estimated preliminary insured losses of $50 billion to $65 billion. Nevertheless, prudent underwriting, continued increases in pricing, reinsurance programs and favorable reserve development should help insurers withstand the blows.Insurance companies are the direct beneficiaries of growing interest rates. Seven rate hikes have been implemented by the Fed in 2022 to control persistent inflation. In the last monetary policy meeting of 2022, the Fed raised interest rates by 50 bps to the range of 4.25 to 4.5%.Riding on operational efficiency resulting in a solid capital position, insurers should continue to engage in strategic mergers and acquisitions to sharpen their competitive edge, build on a niche, expand globally, diversify their portfolio and deploy capital to enhance shareholder value. Per a report from the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, the insurance industry witnessed 427 completed deals in the first half of 2022, which increased 16% year over year.The insurers have increased investment in emerging technologies in a bid to drive efficiency, enhance cybersecurity, upgrade claims systems as well as expand automation capabilities across the organization. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing, the emergence of insurtech and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.  Now let’s take a look at how CINF and CNA are poised.Story continuesPrice PerformanceCNA Financial has lost 6.6% in the past year compared to the industry’s increase of 2.1%. Cincinnati Financial shares have declined 7.4% in the said time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchReturn on Equity (ROE)CNA Financial, with a return on equity (ROE) of 10.08%, exceeds Cincinnati Financial’s ROE of 7% and the industry average of 6.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuationThe price-to-book value is the best multiple used for valuing insurers. Compared with Cincinnati Financial’s P/B ratio of 1.81, CNA Financial is cheaper, with a reading of 1.45. The P&amp;C insurance industry’s P/B ratio is 1.57.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDebt-to-CapitalCNA Financial’s debt-to-capital ratio of 25.5 is higher than Cincinnati Financial’s reading of 8.6 as well as the industry average of 20.5. Therefore, Cincinnati Financial has an advantage over CNA Financial on this front.Earnings Surprise HistoryCincinnati Financial outpaced expectations in five of the last six reported quarters. CNA Financial surpassed estimates in four of the last six reported quarters.Growth ProjectionEarnings growth and stock price gains often indicate a company’s strong prospects.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CNA Financial’s 2023 earnings implies year-over-year increase of 12.5%, while that of Cincinnati Financial suggests year-over-year increase of 7.1%.Therefore, CNA Financial is at an advantage on this front.Combined RatioCNA Financial’s combined ratio was 93 in the first nine months of 2022, whereas that of Cincinnati Financial was 99.2% in the said time frame. Thus, the combined ratio of CNA was better than CINF.Dividend YieldCNA Financial’s dividend yield of 3.7% betters Cincinnati Financial’s dividend yield of 2.5%. Thus, CNA has an advantage over CINF on this front.To ConcludeOur comparative analysis shows that CNA Financial is better positioned than Cincinnati Financial with respect to price performance, dividend yield, return on equity, valuation, combined ratio and growth projection. Meanwhile, Cincinnati Financial scores higher in terms of leverage and earnings surprise history. With the scale significantly tilted toward CNA, the stock appears to be better poised.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

375,1b62ab95-4b76-3965-8c48-e92dcaeb0d9a,GE,2023-01-18,General Electric (GE) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-electric-ge-reports-next-150003016.html,1673967603,STORY,['GE'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when General Electric (GE) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis industrial conglomerate is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +19.6%.Revenues are expected to be $21.87 billion, up 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.57% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for GE?For GE, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.82%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that GE will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that GE would post earnings of $0.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.35, delivering a surprise of -25.53%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.GE doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At UnitedHealth GroupOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President &amp; COO, Dirk McMahon, for US$8.0m worth of shares, at about US$543 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$485. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 2.24k shares worth US$1.0m. But they sold 69.78k shares for US$35m. All up, insiders sold more shares in UnitedHealth Group than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).UnitedHealth Group Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at UnitedHealth Group. In total, Executive VP &amp; Chief People Office Erin L. McSweeney sold US$244k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes UnitedHealth Group Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. UnitedHealth Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$1.5b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About UnitedHealth Group Insiders?An insider sold UnitedHealth Group shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. On the plus side, UnitedHealth Group makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of UnitedHealth Group.But note: UnitedHealth Group may not be the best stock to buy.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned -6.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, which UnitedHealth falls in, has lost 6.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $6.05 per share, indicating a change of +10.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $24.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.1%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.10 indicates a change of +13% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UnitedHealth.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UNH _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate of $88.66 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $359.66 billion and $382.62 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11% and +6.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $82.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.3%. EPS of $5.34 for the same period compares with $4.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $82.79 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of 0%. The EPS surprise was +3.29%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend reinvestments and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best DRIP Stocks To Own. A dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, is an investment strategy through which investors reinvest their cash dividends into the respective company’s additional shares. DRIP strategy has proven to be one of the most convenient schemes for generating compounded returns. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, spoke to CNBC about the benefits of investing in dividend stocks during inflationary periods. He mentioned that dividend stocks ‘reduce the overall volatility’. He also asserted that reinvested dividends contributed 33% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 since 1945.Various reports have revealed the importance of reinvested dividends in overall market returns. According to Schroders, the average annual growth across eight markets without dividend reinvestment was 4.3% from 1993 to 2018 and jumped to 7.1% when reinvested dividends were included. The report also mentioned that the S&amp;P 500 returned 7.5% during the same periods without dividends, with dividend reinvestments taking the total return to 9.7%. Another study done by Professor Elroy at London Business School for the Credit Suisse Yearbook 2011 mentioned that investments made from 1900 to 2010 would have generated an annualized return of 5%. However, the total return would have jumped to 9.4% with reinvested dividends.With rising interest rates and growing inflation, investors prefer dividend stocks to generate stable income. In this regard, companies that raise their dividends regularly and have stable cash flow generation gain investors’ attention. Charles Schwab cited data from Compustat, Ned Davis Research, S&amp;P Capital IQ, and S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which shows that stocks that grew and initiated their dividends returned 13.7% from 1981 to 2020, compared with a 9.60% return of those that didn’t pay dividends. Among dividend stocks, investors are paying attention to AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) due to their solid dividend policies.

Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”7.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Kellogg (K) earns a Zacks Rank #3 23 days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 9, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.89 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.89 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.84 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Kellogg has an Earnings ESP of 6.52%.K is one of just a large database of Consumer Staples stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Procter &amp; Gamble (PG).Procter &amp; Gamble, which is readying to report earnings on January 19, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.58 a share, and PG is two days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Procter &amp; Gamble is $1.58, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.28%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, K and PG could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

387,e0066659-1129-3f3b-bf69-d9d92d25b125,DHI,2023-01-18,Earnings Preview: D.R. Horton (DHI) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-d-r-horton-150003575.html,1673967603,STORY,['DHI'],"[D.R. Horton (DHI) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis homebuilder is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.25 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -29%.Revenues are expected to be $6.5 billion, down 7.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.39% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for D.R. Horton?For D.R. Horton, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.40%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that D.R. Horton will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that D.R. Horton would post earnings of $5.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.67, delivering a surprise of -7.71%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.D.R. Horton doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend reinvestments and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best DRIP Stocks To Own. A dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, is an investment strategy through which investors reinvest their cash dividends into the respective company’s additional shares. DRIP strategy has proven to be one of the most convenient schemes for generating compounded returns. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, spoke to CNBC about the benefits of investing in dividend stocks during inflationary periods. He mentioned that dividend stocks ‘reduce the overall volatility’. He also asserted that reinvested dividends contributed 33% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 since 1945.Various reports have revealed the importance of reinvested dividends in overall market returns. According to Schroders, the average annual growth across eight markets without dividend reinvestment was 4.3% from 1993 to 2018 and jumped to 7.1% when reinvested dividends were included. The report also mentioned that the S&amp;P 500 returned 7.5% during the same periods without dividends, with dividend reinvestments taking the total return to 9.7%. Another study done by Professor Elroy at London Business School for the Credit Suisse Yearbook 2011 mentioned that investments made from 1900 to 2010 would have generated an annualized return of 5%. However, the total return would have jumped to 9.4% with reinvested dividends.With rising interest rates and growing inflation, investors prefer dividend stocks to generate stable income. In this regard, companies that raise their dividends regularly and have stable cash flow generation gain investors’ attention. Charles Schwab cited data from Compustat, Ned Davis Research, S&amp;P Capital IQ, and S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which shows that stocks that grew and initiated their dividends returned 13.7% from 1981 to 2020, compared with a 9.60% return of those that didn’t pay dividends. Among dividend stocks, investors are paying attention to AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) due to their solid dividend policies.

Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”7.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Aflac Inc. AFL, Reinsurance Group of America Inc. RGA, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Inc. MMC, Unum Group UNM and The Travelers Companies Inc. TRV.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:5 Insurance Stocks to Buy Ahead of Q4 Earnings ResultsWall Street kicked off the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings season last Friday. However, the season will gather pace this week. This reporting cycle will be important as market participants will closely monitor any sign of earnings, revenues or margin decline.A large section of economists and financial experts are concerned that the U.S. economy may face at least a mild recession in 2023 with a higher interest rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed.Nevertheless, five insurers are likely to beat Q4 2022 earnings results. These are - Aflac Inc., Reinsurance Group of America Inc., Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Inc., Unum Group and The Travelers Companies Inc.Insurance Sector Q4 2022An improving interest rate environment benefits life insurers as their products and investments are rate sensitive. A favorable interest rate thus impacts life insurers' earnings, capital and reserves, liquidity, and competitiveness positively.Insurance brokerage firms are continuously expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products. The rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance.Story continuesTo maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. Insurers are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate.Accelerated digitization is also curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. It will also help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and retention rate. While investments in technology increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, insurers must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Our Top PicksFive insurance companies are set to beat on fourth quarter earnings results.

However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Federal Realty shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Federal Realty is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry that ranks in the Bottom  38% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, five analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none has dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.55 per share to $1.56 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Federal Realty right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

397,89bd0880-1b22-3254-ad0b-c42b7798f5ec,UHS,2023-01-18,Investors Should Watch These 4 Hospital Stocks Despite Headwinds,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-watch-4-hospital-stocks-134601937.html,1673963161,STORY,"['HCA', 'THC', 'UHS', 'ACHC', '^GSPC']","[The operating environment for hospital companies is improving with increasing non-Covid utilization, outpatient surgeries and patient days. Staffing challenges are expected to decrease this year. However, recession fears, inflation and resultant escalating costs are eating up Zacks Medical-Hospital industry players’ margins. Growing competition in this market remains a common theme. Technological innovations and adoptions are expected to continue boosting hospital companies’ efficiency and generating cost savings. Leading industry players like HCA Healthcare Inc. HCA, Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. ACHC and Tenet Healthcare Corporation THC are set to benefit from these developments.About the Industry The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry comprises for-profit hospital companies that provide healthcare through different types of hospitals, such as acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric. These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care and diagnostic and emergency services. Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.4 Key Trends to Watch in the Hospital IndustryImproving Volumes: Going ahead, non-COVID admissions are expected to continue rising as the intensity of COVID-related utilization of resources declines. Demand for elective procedures is expected to drive patient volumes. Growth in admissions, outpatient surgeries and Medicare reimbursements and deferred procedures can support hospital companies' revenues. However, inflationary pressures and financial constraints can force patients to delay addressing some non-emergency medical needs. The benefits of the Affordable Care Act and similar safety nets can provide customers with some respite, which can help patients navigate tough times.Story continuesIncreasing Expenses: With rising patient volumes, operating costs are bound to go up. High salaries, wages and benefits and increasing costs of hospital supplies due to inflation will likely reduce margins. Also, growth-project investments will keep expenses elevated, putting pressure on the bottom line. Even though labor shortages are expected to keep creating headaches for the industry players, the situation is expected to improve in the coming days. Moreover, renegotiating contracts with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Growth in the Elderly Population: Steady advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare enable the senior population to witness constant growth. This can result in rising demand for hospital services in the long term. The U.S. Census Bureau’s revised report suggests that individuals above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the country’s population, reflecting a climb from 17% in 2020 to 21% in 2030. This demographic change and the rising incidence of diseases will likely be industry drivers. Plus, the increasing number of people signing up for healthcare plans through the Affordable Care Act indicates fewer challenges to visiting hospitals in the future.Technological Improvements: Technological innovations, improvements and wider adoption will continue to be a major theme in the hospital space. The trend should optimize hospital services, minimize unnecessary expenses and enhance the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which will likely rise in the future. The industry players are leveraging AI and automation along with real-time analytics to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis that hospitals utilize. The companies are using the virtual health domain to heighten their efficiency by limiting the patients’ waiting time and trimming their treatment costs.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish OutlookThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #216, which places it in the bottom 14% of nearly 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have declined 19.1% in the past year. Given the lackluster near-term prospects, companies in the space are expected to take a hit.Before we present the stocks that you may want to watch, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; Sector The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry has fared better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its broader sector over the past year. During this time period, the stocks in this industry have declined 0.5% compared with the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 14.1% and the Zacks Medical sector’s decrease of 10.4%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing hospital stocks, the industry trades at 8.21X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 12.09X and the sector’s 8.37X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 8.75X, as low as 5.57X and at a median of 7.76X as the charts below show.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past 5 Years)4 Stocks to Watch ForWe are presenting four stocks with a Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold) from the Medical-Hospital industry.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It is worth considering American Water Works (AWK), which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Water Supply industry.When looking at the last two reports, this water utility has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 7.33%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, American Water Works was expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share, but it reported $1.63 per share instead, representing a surprise of 9.40%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.14 per share, while it actually produced $1.20 per share, a surprise of 5.26%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for American Water Works lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.American Water Works has an Earnings ESP of +0.66% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Murray won the prestigious award for her accomplishments on and off the court, joining an impressive group of former Gatorade National Volleyball Players of the Year who have combined for more than 91 gold medals and 13 National Championships.Murray was surprised with the trophy by her family, coaches and teammates at school. Check out a video of the surprise here.The Gatorade Player of the Year award recognizes athletes not just for their excellence on the playing surface, but for their commitment in the classroom and impact in their community. Murray beat out nearly half a million other student-athletes who play high school volleyball nationwide, topping the list of state winners in volleyball who collectively boast an incredible list of accomplishments, including 45 with signed National Letters of Intent to play volleyball at Division I colleges/universities and 19 with a GPA of 4.0 and above.""Murray has been a star since delivering 700 kills in her debut high school season,"" said John Tawa, the national high school and club writer for VolleyballMag.com. ""She's just so fast and vertically explosive that it's hard to get in front of her. Even when a defense is set, her arm swing is so electric, it eats defenses up. She also has every shot in the book; give her a set and she will score no matter where she is on the floor. Despite her dynamic offensive skill set, Murray is a complete player. She makes passing look effortless and her quick feet allow her to pursue with abandon.

She graduated from high school in December and will attend classes in the spring semester.In addition to excellence on and off the field of play, Gatorade Players of the Year also pay it forward for the next generation. As part of Gatorade's Play it Forward initiative, Murray will receive a grant to give to one of Gatorade's social impact partners – Athlete Ally, Laureus USA, Move United, Women's Sports Foundation and Up2Us Sports – supporting Gatorade's ambition to fuel the future of sport.""What makes this award special is we look at the whole athlete, not just their on-court achievements,"" said President and General Manager of Gatorade Michael Del Pozzo.

Major stock indexes have recorded two consecutive weeks of gains.A lower wage rate and a contraction in the services sector PMI raised hopes that inflation is cooling in the desired direction. At the same time, market participants remained optimistic that a resilient labor market would enable the Fed with a soft landing of the economy.At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in high dividend paying U.S. corporate behemoths with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies have a strong business model, a solid financial position and globally recognized brand value. A favorable Zacks Rank indicates near-term upside potential of the stocks and high dividend yields should provide a regular income stream.Immediate CatalystsThe Department of Labor reported that the nonfarm payroll increased 223,000 in December beating the consensus estimate of 208,000. However, December’s job additions fell below November’s data that were revised downward to 256,000 from 263,000 reported earlier.Hourly wage rate increased 0.3% in December below the consensus estimate of 0.4%. November’s data was revised downward to 0.4% from 0.6% reported earlier. Year over year,  the hourly wage rate increased 4.6% in December compared with the consensus estimate of 5%. The wage rate increased 4.8% year over year in November.Peak inflation seems behind us. Less-than-expected inflation rates in October and November with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this.The Institute of Supply Management reported that the services sector index for December plummeted to 49.6% in December from 56.5% in November. The consensus estimate was 55.1%. Any reading below 50% indicates a contraction in services activities. The index contracted for the first time since May 2020, at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.A devastated housing market owing to the high mortgage rate, disappointing retail sales in December, the peak festive season, huge inventory accumulation by several retailers, a stiff fall in U.S. manufacturing activities and a good chunk of manpower retrenchment by several U.S. corporate giants indicated that the U.S. economy is cooling in the desired direction of the Fed.Story continuesConsumer Sentiment Data Indicates Inflation Will EaseThe University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 13 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a preliminary reading of 4.0% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021. At the five-year horizon, the outlook rose to 3.0% from 2.9% last month, staying within the range of 2.9%-3.1% for 17 of the last 18 months.Per the report, consumers believe that price pressures will ease considerably over the next 12 months, with the one-year inflation outlook falling in January to the lowest level since the spring of 2021. Consequently, consumers spirits are getting a boost. The University of Michigan's preliminary January reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment came in at 64.6%, up from 59.7% in the prior month.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate bigwigs (market capital &gt; $50 billion) with a current dividend yield of &gt; 2%.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.4%.Revenues are expected to be $6.26 billion, up 9.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.63% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Union Pacific?For Union Pacific, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.36%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Union Pacific will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Union Pacific would post earnings of $3.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.19, delivering a surprise of +4.25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Union Pacific doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The proposed plan will allow Pack Health's square footage to nearly double, from 25,000 square feet to 46,000 square feet, and increase parking for those onsite. The renovation is expected to be complete in June of 2023. The 200 positions, which will include mainly additional Health Advisors and coaching staff, with some member services representatives and software engineers joining, will be added to Pack Health's team by 2027.""It is our pleasure to work with the State of Alabama to grow Pack Health in Birmingham,"" said Mazi Rasulnia, PhD, Founder and Vice President of Pack Health.
